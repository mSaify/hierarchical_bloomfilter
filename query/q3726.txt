In physical cosmology and astronomy, dark energy is a hypothetical form of
energy that permeates all of space and tends to increase the rate of expansion
of the universe.[1] Dark energy is the most popular way to explain recent
observations that the universe appears to be expanding at an accelerating
rate. In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy currently accounts for
74% of the total mass-energy of the universe.

Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant
energy density filling space homogeneously,[2] and scalar fields such as
quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in
time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space
are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological
constant is physically equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields which do
change in space can be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant
because the change may be extremely slow.

High-precision measurements of the expansion of the universe are required to
understand how the expansion rate changes over time. In general relativity,
the evolution of the expansion rate is parameterized by the cosmological
equation of state. Measuring the equation of state of dark energy is one of
the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today.

Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard FLRW metric leads to
the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the "standard model" of
cosmology because of its precise agreement with observations. Dark energy has
been used as a crucial ingredient in a recent attempt[3] to formulate a cyclic
model for the universe.

## [edit] Evidence for dark energy

### [edit] Supernovae

In 1998, published observations of Type Ia supernovae ("one-A") by the High-z
Supernova Search Team [4] followed in 1999 by the Supernova Cosmology Project
[5] suggested that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Since then,
these observations have been corroborated by several independent sources.
Measurements of the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and
the large scale structure of the cosmos as well as improved measurements of
supernovae have been consistent with the Lambda-CDM model.[6]

Supernovae are useful for cosmology because they are excellent standard
candles across cosmological distances. They allow the expansion history of the
Universe to be measured by looking at the relationship between the distance to
an object and its redshift, which gives how fast it is receding from us. The
relationship is roughly linear, according to Hubble's law. It is relatively
easy to measure redshift, but finding the distance to an object is more
difficult. Usually, astronomers use standard candles: objects for which the
intrinsic brightness, the absolute magnitude, is known. This allows the
object's distance to be measured from its actually observed brightness, or
apparent magnitude. Type Ia supernovae are the best-known standard candles
across cosmological distances because of their extreme, and extremely
consistent, brightness.

### [edit] Cosmic Microwave Background

Estimated distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe

The existence of dark energy, in whatever form, is needed to reconcile the
measured geometry of space with the total amount of matter in the universe.
Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, most recently
by the WMAP satellite, indicate that the universe is very close to flat. For
the shape of the universe to be flat, the mass/energy density of the universe
must be equal to a certain critical density. The total amount of matter in the
universe (including baryons and dark matter), as measured by the CMB, accounts
for only about 30% of the critical density. This implies the existence of an
additional form of energy to account for the remaining 70%.[6] The most recent
WMAP observations are consistent with a universe made up of 74% dark energy,
22% dark matter, and 4% ordinary matter.

### [edit] Large-Scale Structure

The theory of large scale structure, which governs the formation of structure
in the universe (stars, quasars, galaxies and galaxy clusters), also suggests
that the density of baryonic matter in the universe is only 30% of the
critical density.

### [edit] Late-time Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect

Accelerated cosmic expansion causes gravitational potential wells and hills to
flatten as photons pass through them, producing cold spots and hot spots on
the CMB aligned with vast supervoids and superclusters. This so-called late-
time Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) is a direct signal of dark energy in
a flat universe,[7] and has recently been detected at high significance by Ho
et al.[8] and Giannantonio et al.[9] In May 2008, Granett, Neyrinck & Szapudi
found arguably the clearest evidence yet for the ISW effect,[10] imaging the
average imprint of superclusters and supervoids on the CMB.

## [edit] Nature of dark energy

The exact nature of this dark energy is a matter of speculation. It is known
to be very homogeneous, not very dense and is not known to interact through
any of the fundamental forces other than gravity. Since it is not very
denseâroughly 10â29 grams per cubic centimeterâit is hard to imagine
experiments to detect it in the laboratory. Dark energy can only have such a
profound impact on the universe, making up 74% of all energy, because it
uniformly fills otherwise empty space. The two leading models are quintessence
and the cosmological constant. Both models include the common characteristic
that dark energy must have negative pressure.

### [edit] Negative Pressure

Independently from its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong
negative pressure in order to explain the observed acceleration in the
expansion rate of the universe.

According to General Relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes
to its gravitational attraction for other things just as its mass density
does. This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to
generate gravitational effects is the Stress-energy tensor, which contains
both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure and
viscosity.

In the Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker metric, it can be shown that a
strong constant negative pressure in all the universe causes an acceleration
in universe expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration
in universe contraction if the universe is already contracting. More exactly,
the second derivative of the universe scale factor, \\ddot{a}, is positive if
the equation of state of the universe is such that w < â 1 / 3.

This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled "gravitational
repulsion", which is a colorful but possibly confusing expression. In fact a
negative pressure does not influence the gravitational interaction between
masses - which remains attractive - but rather alters the overall evolution of
the universe at the cosmological scale, typically resulting in the
accelerating expansion of the universe despite the attraction among the masses
present in the universe.

### [edit] Cosmological constant

Main article: Cosmological constant

For more details on this topic, see Equation of state (cosmology).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is simply the "cost of
having space": that is, a volume of space has some intrinsic, fundamental
energy. This is the cosmological constant, sometimes called Lambda (hence
Lambda-CDM model) after the Greek letter Î, the symbol used to mathematically
represent this quantity. Since energy and mass are related by E = mc2,
Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that it will have a
gravitational effect. It is sometimes called a vacuum energy because it is the
energy density of empty vacuum. In fact, most theories of particle physics
predict vacuum fluctuations that would give the vacuum this sort of energy.
This is related to the Casimir Effect, in which there is a small suction into
regions where virtual particles are geometrically inhibited from forming (e.g.
between plates with tiny separation). The cosmological constant is estimated
by cosmologists to be on the order of 10â29g/cmÂ³, or about 10â120 in
reduced Planck units. However, particle physics predicts a natural value of 1
in reduced Planck units, a large discrepancy which is still lacking in
explanation.

The cosmological constant has negative pressure equal to its energy density
and so causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. The reason why a
cosmological constant has negative pressure can be seen from classical
thermodynamics; Energy must be lost from inside a container to do work on the
container. A change in volume dV requires work done equal to a change of
energy âp dV, where p is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a box of
vacuum energy actually increases when the volume increases (dV is positive),
because the energy is equal to ÏV, where Ï (rho) is the energy density of
the cosmological constant. Therefore, p is negative and, in fact, p = âÏ.

A major outstanding problem is that most quantum field theories predict a huge
cosmological constant from the energy of the quantum vacuum, more than 100
orders of magnitude too large.[11] This would need to be cancelled almost, but
not exactly, by an equally large term of the opposite sign. Some
supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero,
which does not help. The present scientific consensus amounts to extrapolating
the empirical evidence where it is relevant to predictions, and fine-tuning
theories until a more elegant solution is found. Technically, this amounts to
checking theories against macroscopic observations. Unfortunately, as the
known error-margin in the constant predicts the fate of the universe more than
its present state, many such "deeper" questions remain unknown.

Another problem arises with inclusion of the cosmic constant in the standard
model: i.e., the appearance of solutions with regions of discontinuities (see
classification of discontinuities for three examples) at low matter
density.[12] Discontinuity also affects the past sign of the pressure assigned
to the cosmic constant, changing from the current negative pressure to
attractive, as one looks back towards the early Universe. A systematic, model-
independent evaluation of the supernovae data supporting inclusion of the
cosmic constant in the standard model indicates these data suffer systematic
error. The supernovae data are not overwhelming evidence for an accelerating
Universe expansion which may be simply gliding.[13] A numerical evaluation of
WMAP and supernovae data for evidence that our local group exists in a local
void with poor matter density compared to other locations, uncovered possible
conflict in the analysis used to support the cosmic constant.[14] These
findings should be considered shortcomings of the standard model, but only
when a term for vacuum energy is included.

In spite of its problems, the cosmological constant is in many respects the
most economical solution to the problem of cosmic acceleration. One number
successfully explains a multitude of observations. Thus, the current standard
model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, includes the cosmological constant
as an essential feature.

### [edit] Quintessence

Main article: Quintessence (physics)

In quintessence models of dark energy, the observed acceleration of the scale
factor is caused by the potential energy of a dynamical field, referred to as
quintessence field. Quintessence differs from the cosmological constant in
that it can vary in space and time. In order for it not to clump and form
structure like matter, the field must be very light so that it has a large
Compton wavelength.

No evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out
either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion
of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the
best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's
equivalence principle and variation of the fundamental constants in space or
time. Scalar fields are predicted by the standard model and string theory, but
an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of
constructing models of cosmic inflation) occurs: renormalization theory
predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses.

The cosmic coincidence problem asks why the cosmic acceleration began when it
did. If cosmic acceleration began earlier in the universe, structures such as
galaxies would never have had time to form and life, at least as we know it,
would never have had a chance to exist. Proponents of the anthropic principle
view this as support for their arguments. However, many models of quintessence
have a so-called tracker behavior, which solves this problem. In these models,
the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than)
the radiation density until matter-radiation equality, which triggers
quintessence to start behaving as dark energy, eventually dominating the
universe. This naturally sets the low energy scale of the dark energy.

In 2004, when scientists fit the evolution of dark energy with the
cosmological data, they found that the equation of state had possibly crossed
the cosmological constant boundary (w=-1) from above to below. A No-Go theorem
has been proved that to give this scenario at least two degrees of freedom are
required for dark energy models. This scenario is so-called Quintom scenario.

Some special cases of quintessence are phantom energy, in which the energy
density of quintessence actually increases with time, and k-essence (short for
kinetic quintessence) which has a non-standard form of kinetic energy. They
can have unusual properties: phantom energy, for example, can cause a Big Rip.

### [edit] Alternative ideas

Some theorists think that dark energy and cosmic acceleration are a failure of
general relativity on very large scales, larger than superclusters. It is a
tremendous extrapolation to think that our law of gravity, which works so well
in the solar system, should work without correction on the scale of the
universe. Most attempts at modifying general relativity, however, have turned
out to be either equivalent to theories of quintessence, or inconsistent with
observations. It is of interest to note that if the equation for gravity were
to approach r instead of r2 at large, intergalactic distances, then the
acceleration of the expansion of the universe becomes a mathematical
artifact,[clarification needed] negating the need for the existence of Dark
Energy.

Alternative ideas for dark energy have come from string theory, brane
cosmology and the holographic principle, but have not yet proved as compelling
as quintessence and the cosmological constant. On string theory, an article in
the journal Nature described:

> String theories, popular with many particle physicists, make it possible,
even desirable, to think that the observable universe is just one of 10500
universes in a grander multiverse, says [Leonard Susskind, a cosmologist at
Stanford University in California]. The vacuum energy will have different
values in different universes, and in many or most it might indeed be vast.
But it must be small in ours because it is only in such a universe that
observers such as ourselves can evolve.[11]

Paul Steinhardt in the same article criticizes string theory's explanation of
dark energy stating "...Anthropics and randomness don't explain anything... I
am disappointed with what most theorists are willing to accept".[11]

In a rather radical departure, an article in the open access journal, Entropy,
by Paul Gough, put forward the suggestion that information energy must make a
significant contribution to dark energy and that this can be shown by
referencing the equation of the state of information in the universe. [15]

Yet another, "radically conservative" class of proposals aims to explain the
observational data by a more refined use of established theories rather than
through the introduction of dark energy, focusing, for example, on the
gravitational effects of density inhomogeneities [16][17] or on consequences
of electroweak symmetry breaking in the early universe.

## [edit] Implications for the fate of the universe

Cosmologists estimate that the acceleration began roughly 5 billion years ago.
Before that, it is thought that the expansion was decelerating, due to the
attractive influence of dark matter and baryons. The density of dark matter in
an expanding universe decreases more quickly than dark energy, and eventually
the dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the volume of the universe
doubles, the density of dark matter is halved but the density of dark energy
is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant in the case of a cosmological
constant).

If the acceleration continues indefinitely, the ultimate result will be that
galaxies outside the local supercluster will move beyond the cosmic horizon:
they will no longer be visible, because their line-of-sight velocity becomes
greater than the speed of light.[18] This is not a violation of special
relativity, and the effect cannot be used to send a signal between them.
(Actually there is no way to even define "relative speed" in a curved
spacetime. Relative speed and velocity can only be meaningfully defined in
flat spacetime or in sufficiently small (infinitesimal) regions of curved
spacetime). Rather, it prevents any communication between them as the objects
pass out of contact. The Earth, the Milky Way and the Virgo supercluster,
however, would remain virtually undisturbed while the rest of the universe
recedes. In this scenario, the local supercluster would ultimately suffer heat
death, just as was thought for the flat, matter-dominated universe, before
measurements of cosmic acceleration.

There are some very speculative ideas about the future of the universe. One
suggests that phantom energy causes divergent expansion, which would imply
that the effective force of dark energy continues growing until it dominates
all other forces in the universe. Under this scenario, dark energy would
ultimately tear apart all gravitationally bound structures, including galaxies
and solar systems, and eventually overcome the electrical and nuclear forces
to tear apart atoms themselves, ending the universe in a "Big Rip". On the
other hand, dark energy might dissipate with time, or even become attractive.
Such uncertainties leave open the possibility that gravity might yet rule the
day and lead to a universe that contracts in on itself in a "Big Crunch". Some
scenarios, such as the cyclic model suggest this could be the case. While
these ideas are not supported by observations, they are not ruled out.
Measurements of acceleration are crucial to determining the ultimate fate of
the universe in big bang theory.

## [edit] History

The cosmological constant was first proposed by Einstein as a mechanism to
obtain a stable solution of the gravitational field equation that would lead
to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity. Not
only was the mechanism an inelegant example of fine-tuning, it was soon
realized that Einstein's static universe would actually be unstable because
local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead to either the runaway expansion or
contraction of the universe. The equilibrium is unstable: if the universe
expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet
more expansion. Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue
contracting. These sorts of disturbances are inevitable, due to the uneven
distribution of matter throughout the universe. More importantly, observations
made by Edwin Hubble showed that the universe appears to be expanding and not
static at all. Einstein famously referred to his failure to predict the idea
of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest
blunder. Following this realization, the cosmological constant was largely
ignored as a historical curiosity.

Alan Guth proposed in the 1970s that a negative pressure field, similar in
concept to dark energy, could drive cosmic inflation in the very early
universe. Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively
similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of
the universe slightly after the Big Bang. Such expansion is an essential
feature of most current models of the Big Bang. However, inflation must have
occurred at a much higher energy density than the dark energy we observe today
and is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction
of a second old. It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark
energy and inflation. Even after inflationary models became accepted, the
cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.

The term "dark energy" was coined by Michael Turner in 1998.[19] By that time,
the missing mass problem of big bang nucleosynthesis and large scale structure
was established, and some cosmologists had started to theorize that there was
an additional component to our universe. The first direct evidence for dark
energy came from supernova observations of accelerated expansion, in Riess et
al[4] and later confirmed in Perlmutter et al..[5] This resulted in the
Lambda-CDM model, which as of 2006 is consistent with a series of increasingly
rigorous cosmological observations, the latest being the 2005 Supernova Legacy
Survey. First results from the SNLS reveal that the average behavior (i.e.,
equation of state) of dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological
constant to a precision of 10 per cent.[20] Recent results from the Hubble
Space Telescope Higher-Z Team indicate that dark energy has been present for
at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration.
