Quirks mode refers to a technique used by some web browsers for the sake of
maintaining backward compatibility with web pages designed for older browsers,
instead of strictly complying with W3C and IETF standards in standards mode.

## [edit] Overview

The structure and appearance of a web page is described by a combination of
two standardized languages: HTML, a markup language designed for web use,
which describes the structure and content of the page, and CSS, a generalized
stylesheet language, which specifies how the page should be rendered in
various media (visual styles for screen display, print styles to use when
printing the page, aural styles to use when the page is read aloud by a screen
reader, etc.). However, most older web browsers either did not fully implement
the specifications for these languages or were developed prior to the
finalization of the specifications (Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0
for the Macintosh platform, released in 2000, was the first major web browser
with full support for CSS Level 1, for example).[1] As a result, many older
web pages were constructed to rely upon the older browsers' incomplete or
incorrect implementations, and will only render as intended when handled by
such a browser.

Support for standardized HTML and CSS in major web browsers has improved
significantly, but the large body of legacy documents which rely on the quirks
of older browsers represents an obstacle for browser developers, who wish to
improve their support for standardized HTML and CSS, but also wish to maintain
backward compatibility with older, non-standardized pages. Additionally, many
new web pages continue to be created in the older fashion, since the
compatibility workarounds introduced by browser developers mean that an
understanding of standardized methods is not strictly necessary.

To maintain compatibility with the greatest possible number of web pages,
modern web browsers are generally developed with multiple rendering modes: in
"standards mode" pages are rendered according to the HTML and CSS
specifications, while in "quirks mode" attempts are made to emulate the
behavior of older browsers. Some browsers (those based on Mozilla's Gecko
rendering engine, or Internet Explorer 8 in strict mode, for example) also use
an "almost standards" mode which attempts to compromise between the two,
implementing one quirk for table cell sizing while otherwise conforming to the
specifications.[2]

### [edit] Comparison of document types

Henri Sivonen compiled a list of various document types and how they are
treated in the most common browsers, showing whether pages are rendered in
Quirks, Standards, or Almost standards mode. The criterion used for "Almost
standards mode" is non-standard table cell height rendering.[2]

## [edit] Mode differences and examples

One prominent difference between quirks and standards modes is the handling of
the CSS Internet Explorer box model bug. Before version 6, Internet Explorer
used an algorithm for determining the width of an element's box which
conflicted with the algorithm detailed in the CSS specification, and due to
Internet Explorer's popularity many pages were created which relied upon this
incorrect algorithm. As of version 6, Internet Explorer uses the CSS
specification's algorithm when rendering in standards mode and uses the
previous, non-standard algorithm when rendering in quirks mode.

Another notable difference is the vertical alignment of certain types of
inline content; many older browsers aligned images to the bottom border of
their containing box, although the CSS specification requires that they be
aligned to the baseline of the text within the box. In standards mode, Gecko-
based browsers will align to the baseline, and in quirks mode they will align
to the bottom.[4]

Additionally, many older browsers did not implement inheritance of font styles
within tables; as a result, font styles had to be specified once for the
document as a whole, and again for the table, even though the CSS
specification requires that font styling be inherited into the table. If the
font sizes are specified using relative units, a standards-compliant browser
would inherit the base font size, then apply the relative font size within the
table: for example, a page which declared a base font size of 80% and a table
font size of 80% (to ensure a size of 80% in browsers which do not properly
inherit font sizes) would, in a standards-compliant browser, display tables
with a font size of 64% (80% of 80%). As a result, browsers typically do not
inherit font sizes into tables in quirks mode.[5]

### [edit] Almost standards mode

A third compatibility mode known as either "almost standards mode" or "strict
mode" which maintains the "traditional" vertical sizing of table cells
according to the CSS2 specification, has been implemented in these browsers:
Safari, Opera 7.5 (and later), all Gecko-based browsers since 1.0.1 (such as
Firefox) and Internet Explorer 8.[2]

"Almost standards" mode rendering matches "standards" mode in all details
except for one. The layout of images inside table cells is handled the same
way "quirks" mode operates, instead, which is fairly consistent with legacy
browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 (and earlier). This means that sliced-
images-in-tables layouts are less likely to fall apart in browsers when in
either "quirks" or "almost standards" mode, rather than "standards" mode.[6]

## [edit] Triggering different rendering modes

Most often, browsers determine which rendering mode to use based on the
presence of a Document Type Declaration in the page; if a full DOCTYPE is
present the browser will use standards mode, and if it is absent the browser
will use quirks mode. For example, a web page which began with the following
DOCTYPE would trigger standards mode:

    
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/DTD/strict.dtd">
    
While this DOCTYPE (which does not contain either the version of HTML in use,
or the URL of an HTML Document Type Definition) would trigger quirks mode:

    
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC>
    
Additionally, a web page which does not include a DOCTYPE at all will render
in quirks mode.

One notable exception to this is Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 browser,
which will render a page in quirks mode if the DOCTYPE is preceded by an XML
prolog, regardless of whether a full DOCTYPE is specified. Thus an XHTML page
which begins with the following code would be rendered in quirks mode by IE 6:

    
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
    
The above is useful to an extent as it can be used to trigger quirks mode in
IE 6, but no other browsers.

Quirks mode in IE any version of IE will also be triggered if anything but
whitespace precedes the DOCTYPE. For example, if a hypertext document contains
a comment or any tag before the DOCTYPE, IE will use quirks mode:

    
    <!-- This comment will put IE 6, 7 and 8 in quirks mode -->
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
    
The problem with the XML declaration was fixed in version 7 of Internet
Explorer, in which the XML prolog is simply ignored.[7] However, for maximum
compatibility with existing and older web browsers the World Wide Web
Consortium, which maintains the XHTML specification, recommends that authors
of XHTML documents omit the XML declaration when possible.[8]

### [edit] Mode verification

In most browsers, the Document Object Model extension `document.compatMode`
indicates the rendering mode for the current pageâin standards mode and
almost-standards mode, `document.compatMode` contains the value "CSS1Compat",
while in quirks mode it equals "BackCompat".[9]

Additionally, in Mozilla Firefox and Opera the rendering mode in use for a
given page is indicated on the 'Page info' informational box.
