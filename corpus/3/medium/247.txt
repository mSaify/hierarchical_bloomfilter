## [edit] History

"Mbube" (Zulu for "lion") was first recorded by its writer, Solomon Linda, and
his group, The Evening Birds, in 1939. Gallo Record Company paid Linda a
single fee for the recording and no royalties. "Mbube" became a hit throughout
South Africa and sold about 100,000 copies during the 1940s. The song became
so popular that Mbube lent its name to a style of African a cappella music,
though the style has since been mostly replaced by isicathamiya (a softer
version).

Alan Lomax brought the song to the attention of Pete Seeger of the folk group
The Weavers. It was on one of several records Lomax lent to Seeger.[1] After
having performed the song for at least a year in their concerts, in November,
1951, the Weavers recorded their version entitled "Wimoweh", a mishearing of
the original song's chorus of 'uyimbube' (meaning "you're a lion"). Pete
Seeger had made some of his own additions to the melody. The song was credited
exclusively to Paul Campbell, a fictitious entity used by Harry Richmond to
copyright material in the public domain.

Pete Seeger explains in one recording, "it refers to an old legend down there,
[about] their last king [of the Zulus], who was known as Shaka The Lion.
Legend says, Shaka The Lion didn't die when Europeans took over our country;
he simply went to sleep, and he'll wake up some day." (See "Senzenina /
Wimoweh" on Seeger's With Voices Together We Sing (Live).) cf. sleeping hero

It was published by Folkways, a subsidiary of Richmond/TRO. Their 1952
version, arranged by Gordon Jenkins, became a top-twenty hit in the U.S., and
their live 1957 recording turned it into a folk music staple. This version was
covered in 1959 by The Kingston Trio.

New lyrics to the song were written by George David Weiss, Luigi Creatore, and
Hugo Peretti, based very loosely upon the meaning of the original song. The
Tokens' 1961 cover of this version rose to number one on the Billboard Hot 100
and still receives fairly frequent replay on many American oldies radio
stations. In the UK, an up-tempo, yodel-dominated rendering was a top-ten hit
for Karl Denver and his Trio. In 1971, Robert John also recorded this version,
and it reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972. Since then, "Wimoweh" /
"The Lion Sleeps Tonight" has remained popular and frequently covered.

## [edit] Copyright issues

Pete Seeger later said in the book A Lion's Trail, "The big mistake I made was
not making sure that my publisher signed a regular songwritersâ contract
with Linda. My publisher simply sent Linda some money and copyrighted The
Weaversâ arrangement here and sent The Weavers some money."

Seeger's publisher was The Richmond Organization (TRO), which also goes by a
number of other names, including Ludlow, Cromwell, Essex, Hollis, Melody
Trails, and Folkways Music Publishers. Since Solomon Linda's 1939 "Mbube" was
apparently not under copyright protection, TRO founder Howard Richmond had
himself claimed authorship to "Wimoweh" using a pseudonym, in this case "Paul
Campbell".

The songwriter and publisher customarily split the earnings of a song 50-50,
and the performers, song pluggers', and agents' shares usually come out of the
composer's half. By claiming authorship, TRO thus secured for itself a nice
chunk of the songwriters' half as well as all of the publishers' share of the
song's earnings.[2].

In 2000, South African journalist Rian Malan wrote a feature article for
Rolling Stone magazine, highlighting Linda's story and estimating that the
song had earned U.S. $15 million for its use in the movie The Lion King alone;
this prompted the South African documentary "A Lion's Trail" by FranÃ§ois
Verster that documented the song's history. Screened by PBS, in September
2006, the documentary won an Emmy Award.

In July 2004, the song became the subject of a lawsuit between the family of
its writer Solomon Linda and Disney. The suit claimed that Disney owed $1.6
million in royalties for the use of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" in the film and
stage production of The Lion King. Meanwhile, publisher of The Weavers'
"Wimoweh", TRO/Folkways, began to pay $3000 annually to Linda's heirs.

In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement for an undisclosed
amount with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the
song to Disney. This settlement has applied to worldwide rights, not just
South Africa, since 1987.
