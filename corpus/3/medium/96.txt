The meerkat or suricate Suricata suricatta is a small mammal and a member of
the mongoose family. It inhabits all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana
and South Africa. A group of meerkats is called a "mob", "gang" or "clan". A
meerkat clan often contains about 20 meerkats at a time, but some
superfamilies have had 50 or more. Meerkats have an average life span of 12-14
years.

## Name

"Meerkat" is a loanword from Afrikaans. The name has a Dutch origin but by
misidentification. Dutch meerkat refers to the "guenon", a monkey of the
Cercopithecus genus. The word "meerkat" is Dutch for "lake cat", but the
suricata is not in the cat family, and neither suricatas nor guenons are
attracted to lakes; the word possibly started as a Dutch adaptation of a
derivative of Sanskrit markaÅ£a à¤®à¤°à¥à¤à¤ = "monkey", perhaps in Africa
via an Indian sailor onboard a Dutch East India Company ship. The traders of
the Dutch East India Company were likely familiar with monkeys, but the Dutch
settlers attached the name to the wrong animal at the Cape. The suricata is
called stokstaartje = "little stick-tail" in Dutch.

According to African popular belief (mainly in the Zambian/Zimbabwean region),
the meerkat is also known as the sun angel, as it protects villages from the
moon devil or the werewolf which is believed to attack stray cattle or lone
tribesmen.

## Anatomy

The meerkat is a small diurnal herpestid (mongoose) weighing on average about
731 grams (1.61 pounds) for males and 720 grams (1.58 pounds) for females. Its
long slender body and limbs give it a body length of 25 to 35 cm (10 to 14
inches) and an added tail length of 17 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches). Its tail is
not bushy like all other mongoose species, but is rather long and thin and
tapers to a black or reddish colored pointed tip. The meerkat uses its tail to
balance when standing upright. Its face tapers, coming to a point at the nose,
which is brown. The eyes always have black patches around them, which help
deflect the sun's glare. The meerkat has small black crescent-shaped ears that
can close when digging to keep sand out. Like cats, meerkats have binocular
vision, a large peripheral range, depth perception, and eyes on the front of
their faces.

At the end of each of a meerkat's "fingers" is a non-retractable, strong, 2 cm
(0.8 inches) long, curved claw used for digging underground burrows and
digging for prey. Claws are also used with muscular hindlegs to help climb the
occasional tree. They have four toes on each foot and long slender limbs. The
coat is usually fawn-colored peppered with gray, tan, or brown with a silver
tint. They have short parallel stripes across their backs, extending from the
base of the tail to the shoulders. The patterns of stripes are unique to each
meerkat. The underside of the meerkat has no markings but the belly has a
patch which is only sparsely covered with hair and shows the black skin
underneath. The meerkat uses this area to absorb heat while standing on its
rear legs, usually early in the morning after cold desert nights.

## Diet and foraging behaviour

<IMG>

<IMG>

Meerkats are primarily insectivores, but also eat lizards, snakes, scorpions,
spiders, plants, eggs, small mammals, millipedes, centipedes and, more rarely,
small birds. They are partially immune to certain venoms; they are immune to
the very strong venom of the scorpions of the Kalahari Desert, unlike
humans.[2] They have no excess body fat stores, so foraging for food is a
daily need.

Meerkats forage in a group with one "sentry" on guard watching for predators
while the others search for food. Sentry duty is usually approximately an hour
long. Baby meerkats do not start foraging for food until they are about 1
month old, and do so by following an older member of the group who acts as the
pup's tutor.[3] The meerkat standing guard makes peeping sounds when all is
well. If the meerkat spots danger, it barks loudly or whistles.

## Reproduction

<IMG>

<IMG>

Meerkats become sexually mature at about one year of age and can have 1 to 5
pups in a litter, with 3 pups being the most common litter size. Wild meerkats
may have up to four litters per year. Meerkats are iteroparous and can
reproduce any time of the year but most births occur in the warmer seasons.
The female meerkat can have more than one litter a year. The pups are allowed
to leave the burrow at three weeks old. When the pups are ready to emerge from
the burrow, the whole clan of meerkats will stand around the burrow to watch.
Some of the adolescents might try to show off so they can have more attention
than the pups.

Reports show that there is no precopulatory display; the male ritually grooms
the female until she submits to him and copulation begins, the male generally
adopting a seated position during the act. Gestation lasts approximately 11
weeks and the young are born within the underground burrow and are altricial.
The young's ears open at about 15 days of age, and their eyes at 10-14 days.
They are weaned around 49 to 63 days. They do not come above ground until at
least 21 days of age and stay with babysitters near the burrow. After another
week or so, they join the adults on a foraging party.

Usually, the alpha pair reserves the right to mate and normally kills any
young not its own, to ensure that its offspring has the best chance of
survival. The dominant couple may also evict, or kick out the mothers of the
offending offspring.

New meerkat groups are often formed by evicted females pairing with roving
males.

If the members of the alpha group are relatives (this tends to happen when the
alpha female dies and is succeeded by a daughter), they do not mate with each
other and reproduction is by group females stray-mating with roving males from
other groups; in this situation, pregnant females tend to kill and eat any
pups born to other females.

## Behavior

<IMG>

<IMG>

Meerkats are small burrowing animals, living in large underground networks
with multiple entrances which they leave only during the day. They are very
social, living in colonies averaging 20-30 members. Animals in the same group
regularly groom each other to strengthen social bonds. The alpha pair often
scent-mark subordinates of the group to express their authority, and this is
usually followed by the subordinates grooming the alphas and licking their
faces. This behavior is also usually practiced when group members are reunited
after a short period apart. Most meerkats in a group are all siblings or
offspring of the alpha pair.

Meerkats demonstrate altruistic behavior within their colonies; one or more
meerkats stand sentry (lookout) while others are foraging or playing, to warn
them of approaching dangers. When a predator is spotted, the meerkat
performing as sentry gives a warning bark, and other members of the gang will
run and hide in one of the many bolt holes they have spread across their
territory. The sentry meerkat is the first to reappear from the burrow and
search for predators, constantly barking to keep the others underground. If
there is no threat, the sentry meerkat stops signaling and the others feel
safe to emerge.

Meerkats also babysit the young in the group. Females that have never produced
offspring of their own often lactate to feed the alpha pair's young, while the
alpha female is away with the rest of the group. They also protect the young
from threats, often endangering their own lives. On warning of danger, the
babysitter takes the young underground to safety and is prepared to defend
them if the danger follows. If retreating underground is not possible, she
collects all young together and lies on top of them.

Meerkats are also known to share their burrow with the Yellow Mongoose and
ground squirrel, species with which they do not compete for resources. If they
are unlucky, sometimes they share their burrow with snakes.

Like most species, meerkat young learn by observing and mimicking adult
behaviour though adults also engage in active instruction. For example,
meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat a venomous scorpion: they will
remove the stinger and help the pup learn how to handle the creature.[4]

Despite this altruistic behaviour, meerkats sometimes kill young members of
their group. Subordinate meerkats have been seen killing the offspring of more
senior members in order to improve their own offspring's position.[5]

Meerkats have been known to engage in social activities, including what appear
to be wrestling matches and foot races.

### Vocalization

It has recently been noted that meerkat calls may carry specific meanings,
with specific calls indicating the approach of snakes, birds of prey, or other
predators. How these calls work is not yet clear.

### Meerkat groups

A meerkat group may die out because of predator attack, its alpha pair being
unable to breed, starvation in a year when the rains fail, or epidemic
disease.

A new meerkat group often arises from evicted females meeting and staying with
roving males, looking for chances to mate. The litter size is usually 2-5
pups.

The size of the groups is variable. A group which becomes over-large may
routinely have to disperse widely to find enough food when foraging. As a
result, when suddenly needing to run for shelter, members of the group may
choose different holes, resulting in the group fissioning.
