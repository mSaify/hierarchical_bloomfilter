Animal Crossing, known as DÅbutsu no Mori (ã©ãã¶ã¤ã®æ£® ?, lit. Animal
Forest) in Japan, is a life simulation video game developed by Nintendo EAD
and published by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan for the Nintendo 64
on April 14, 2001. Due to limited sales because of the drastically decreasing
N64 market, the game went unreleased for the N64 outside of Japan and was
ported to the Nintendo GameCube in Japan on December 14, 2001; North America
on September 15, 2002; Australia on October 17, 2003; and Europe on September
24, 2004. The Japanese GameCube version lacks e-Reader support, a feature
found in the North American and Australian versions. A version of Animal
Crossing was released in Japan with e-Reader support on June 27, 2003.

A Nintendo DS follow-up, Animal Crossing: Wild World, was released in December
2005. A second follow-up for the Wii, Animal Crossing: City Folk, was released
on November 16, 2008.

## [edit] History

DÅbutsu no Mori Plus, the Nintendo GameCube version of DÅbutsu no Mori, was
released on December 14, 2001, eight months after the original game. This
version contains extra features that had to be left out in the Nintendo 64
version, and also utilizes the GameCube's built-in clock to keep track of the
date and time. The Nintendo 64 version utilised a clock internal to the game
cartridge. With the use of the GameCube's clock, the passing of time affects
the game, even between play sessions. This led to the game's slogan, "It's
playing, even when you're not." DÅbutsu no Mori Plus (for the GameCube) cost
7,140 yen and sold 92,568 copies during its first week of sale in Japan.[1][2]

When Nintendo decided to port DÅbutsu no Mori to the Nintendo GameCube, the
American version, Animal Crossing, had much more text than the Japanese
version, DÅbutsu no Mori Plus, in part because of the immense translation
that Nintendo undertook when translating DÅbutsu no Mori from Japanese to
English. Not only did thousands of lines of text have to be translated, but
the translators had to create new holidays and items. Nintendo Japan was so
impressed with the results of the translation done by Nintendo of America's
Treehouse division that they translated NOA's version back into Japanese and
released it as DÅbutsu no Mori e-Plus. DÅbutsu no Mori e-Plus was released
in Japan on June 27, 2003, and sold 91,658 copies during its first week of
sale.[2][3]

## [edit] Gameplay

Animal Crossing is a social simulator that has been dubbed a "communication
game" by Nintendo. It is an open-ended game, where a player can live a
separate life with little preset plot or mandatory tasks. Players assume the
role of a new resident to the town. The gender and looks of your character
depends on the answers given to a cat named Rover on the train. There are also
certain tasks that players can choose to complete, and goals they can choose
to achieve. The game is played out in real-timeâobserving days, weeks,
months, and years using the GameCube's internal clock. There are many actual
events and holidays spanning the year, including Independence Day, Halloween,
the Harvest Festival (Thanksgiving), and Toy Day (Christmas) among others.
Other regular activities such as early morning fitness classes and fishing
tournaments are included in the game as well. When players are done playing,
they can go talk to their gyroid (a creature next to their house) and save. If
a player turns off the game or resets the GameCube without saving first, the
next time they play the game, a mole called Resetti will appear in front of
the player's house to scold them for quitting without saving first. Resetti's
brother Don occasionally appears in his place, apologizing for his brother's
rudeness.

### [edit] House improvements

The main goal of the game, given to the player during the game's opening cut
scenes, is to increase the size of the player's house. This house serves as
the repository for furniture and other items bought or acquired during the
course of the game. It can be customized in a number of ways, including roof
color, furniture, the music (if any) that plays when a player enters the
house, wallpaper, and flooring. These customizations are judged by the Happy
Room Academy (or HRA) every day in-game. While the player's HRA score does not
affect gameplay,[citation needed] some players enjoy getting the highest score
possible. As the player's house gets bigger, more pieces of furniture can be
kept in the house, thus making it easier to have a bigger score.

Tom Nook, a tanuki in the Japanese version and a raccoon in the American and
European version, runs the local store. At the beginning of the game, he gives
the player their first house with a mortgage of 19,800 Bells (the in-game
currency). The house is comically small, furnished only with tasteless
wallpaper, flooring, a box, a journal, and a radio. Upon paying off the entire
debt, part of which is done through a part-time job to Tom Nook, the player is
"offered" to expand the house. In reality, the house is upgraded even if you
say no. This cycle repeats itself four times with the mortgage significantly
increasing each time (with the exception of the basement addition). The first
player in an Animal Crossing village to completely pay off all mortgage loans
will receive a golden statue that is erected in their honor in front of the
train station. The second player to do so will receive a silver statue, the
third a bronze, and the fourth a jade.

Though Tom Nook is more than willing to sell furniture and other items to fill
a house, there are many other ways to acquire furnishings. You may go to the
water to find shells that can be traded for bells. A trip to the town dump may
yield items that were unwanted by someone else and are thus free. The police
station has a lost and found department run by Officer Booker, who will allow
anyone to claim any item that has ended up there. Other villagers that live
nearby may need favors and will reward the player for their help. Redd (a fox
who randomly sets up his tent in your town) sells furniture, some of which are
rare. Players can even obtain new furniture items by shaking trees until a
piece of furniture falls from one.

The Animal Crossing village is 30 acres (120,000 m2) in size and initially
contains five villagers, and more will move in or out depending on the
player's actions. All of the villagers are animals, hence the game's name, and
each has their own small home that the player can visit. There are many
possible interactions between the player and the villagers. These include
talking, trading furniture and other objects, completing tasks for rewards,
writing letters, and, in Doubutso No Mori e+, buying them medicine when they
get sick (also featured in Wild World and City Folk). Villagers will also
interact with each other. There are roughly 200 villagers, but no more than
fifteen can ever live in a town at once. Each villager also has a catch phrase
that they use regularly, often relating to the type of animal they are. For
example, a cow might say, "moo-la-la" or "macmoo". These phrases can be
changed at times if the villager asks the player to do so. Villagers can also
often pick up their neighbors' catch phrase. When characters go in their house
and go to sleep, or if the villager is not in the Acre its house is in,
players cannot visit the villagers or go in their houses. Some villagers sleep
early and wake early, and some villagers go to bed just as the sun is coming
up. Each villager has a distinct personality and a villager's personality not
only determines when they sleep, but it also determines most of their
behavior, especially their interactive behavior with the user-created
characters.

If the player does not interact with individual villagers on a regular basis,
they are likely to leave the village. If you only have one town, the villager
will be gone forever; however, if a second memory card with a town on it is
inserted into slot B of the GameCube Console, they may move there and still
remember your character. The village also has a level of attractiveness that
depends on certain parameters that the game itself never explicitly describes
to the player, but hints are given to the player by a spirit living in the
village fountain, and players have discovered that the main factor is the
density of trees.[4] A high level of attractiveness will draw new animals to
live in the village.

### [edit] Nintendo Entertainment System games

Nineteen Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games are available to collect in
Animal Crossing. Animal Crossing is packaged in North America with a memory
card that automatically gives the player two games upon creating a game file.
Others are acquired in various ways. The NES games that can be found and
played in Animal Crossing are:

  * Balloon Fight
  * Baseball
  * Clu Clu Land
  * Clu Clu Land D
  * Donkey Kong
  * Donkey Kong 3
  * Donkey Kong Junior

  * Donkey Kong Jr. Math
  * Excitebike
  * Golf
  * Ice Climber
  * Mario Bros.
  * Pinball

  * Punch-Out!!
  * Soccer
  * Super Mario Bros.
  * Tennis
  * The Legend of Zelda
  * Wario's Woods

  
A handful of these games cannot be accessed without the use of an Nintendo
e-Reader card. In the Japanese versions of Animal Crossing, Excitebike is
replaced by Gomoku Narabe, and Soccer by Mah-jong.

Advance Play is when the player links a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube to
download the NES game to the handheld temporarily. This is not available for
games that were originally produced for the Famicom Disk System, such as Clu
Clu Land D and The Legend of Zelda or are larger than 192 kB, such as Punch-
Out!! and Wario's Woods, which cannot fit into the GBA's RAM. All other games
can be played on Advance Play, but they are slightly squashed on the Game
Boy's display (as in PocketNES) because of the GBA's smaller vertical
resolution and are limited to one player.

### [edit] Multiplayer

There are three types of multiplayer game play in Animal Crossing.

In the first, up to four players can create their own houses in a single
village. No two players can play at the same time, but by taking turns they
can each affect the village in their own ways, communicate with each other via
the town board and mail, and share in the experiences of the village.

In the second, two players can play NES games together. This requires two
controllers and a multiplayer NES game. Once the controllers are in the
players are able to select the NES game they want to play. Once the game is
started, players can select the two-player option and start playing
multiplayer.

A third type of multiplayer play consists of trading items with another player
using a system of codes. Tom Nook operates a system through which a player can
"ship" an item to another player in another town. The player hands an item to
Tom Nook and specifies the recipient's name and town, and Tom Nook gives the
player a 28-character code. In the other town, the player tells the code to
Tom Nook and receives the item. Another way to trade items is to simply travel
to a friend's town and drop the item the player wants to give them. This
prevents the loss of the item code which must be memorized or written down.

### [edit] Traveling

Animal Crossing has a traveling system that allows one character to visit a
friend's village. This system requires an additional memory card with Animal
Crossing game data, and three blocks of memory to save "travel data". Players
go to the train station and tell Porter they want to take a trip. The train
will arrive and they board it. This saves "travel data" on the other memory
card. Players then arrive at the other town. If a player turns off the console
in another town or while they are on the train, the next time they play, the
player's eyes will be missing and will look black (which is called a "missing
face"), and all the player's items in their pockets (including their bells)
will be gone. Resetti will not come.

Players can meet new villagers, shop at Nook's (which will have different
stock), shop at the Able Sisters (which may have different patterns) and do
almost anything else that they can do in their own town. There are only a few
things visitors cannot do, and they all center around the idea that the
character is visiting another town, which means the character does not have
the same privileges and does not receive the same services that they would in
their own town. For example, another town's Nook will not travel to paint a
roof, and so players cannot buy paint in another town.

After visiting another town, one of the villagers may move to the visited
town. If the visited town has a full fifteen villagers, this will prompt
someone from the visited town to move away. Depending upon how many memory
cards a player owns, there can be many other villages to see and different
items to find.

Villagers can move even if none of the user-created characters travel to
another town. If a memory card for another town is in the second slot in the
Nintendo GameCube, when a villager leaves, they move to the other town instead
of just moving out. If a player interacts with a villager who has moved away
from his or her town to the one he or she is visiting, the villager will
remember the player.

Items can be traded by dropping the item outdoors in one's friend's town or
through a Gyroid. For items that cannot be dropped, the item must be placed
for sale or given away through the Gyroid.

### [edit] Using the Game Boy Advance

Game Boy Advance connectivity plays a role in Animal Crossing, using a
Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable.

#### [edit] Tropical island

In Animal Crossing, each town has a tropical island which can be accessed by
plugging in a Game Boy Advance with a GameCube Link Cable. A character called
Kapp'n ferries the player to the island for free. An exclusive animal roams
the island, whom the player can become friends with. The island has an
exclusive type of fruit, coconuts. The player can also decorate a small
communal beach house and fish at the shores. On leaving, the player can
download the island to a GBA and give fruit to the villager, whom drops bells;
if the player then returns to the island, they can pick up the money that has
been dropped. Players can also leave the islander tools to use, such as the
shovel or net. Downloaded islands can also be traded between GBAs, using a
Game Boy Advance Link Cable.

#### [edit] The Able Sisters

The Game Boy Advance can also be used when shopping at the Able Sisters. The
pattern design tool can be downloaded to a Game Boy Advance, and the player
can then upload designs made on a Game Boy Advance to the GameCube. This
feature can be accessed by plugging in a Game Boy Advance with a Nintendo
GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable and talking to Mabel in the Able Sisters shop.

Animal Crossing was named the seventh best game of all time on the Nintendo
GameCube by the television show X-Play on the television network
G4TV.[citation needed] On IGN, the game holds an "outstanding" 9.1 rating.

Animal Crossing was also rated the fifth-best GameCube game by ScrewAttack on
their "Farewell to the GameCube, ten GameCube games" list, saying, "It's a
game that plays even when you're not and can last up to 20 years!" The game's
popularity inspired the creation of an animated film based on Animal Crossing:
Wild World, which was released in Japan.
