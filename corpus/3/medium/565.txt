INFP (Introversion, iNtuition, Feeling, Perception) is an abbreviation used in
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) publications to refer to one of the
sixteen personality types.[1][2] The MBTI was developed from the work of
prominent psychiatrist Carl G. Jung in his book Psychological Types, which
proposed a psychological typology based on his theories of cognitive
functions. These theories were based on clinical observation, however, rather
than the controlled studies required for acceptance by the modern field of
cognitive psychology.[3]

From Jung's work others developed psychological typologies. Well-known
personality tests are the MBTI assessment, developed by Isabel Briggs Myers
and Katharine Cook Briggs, and the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, developed by
David Keirsey. Keirsey referred to the INFPs as Healers, one of the four types
belonging to the temperament he called the Idealists.[4]

## [edit] The MBTI instrument

The MBTI preferences indicate the differences in people based on the
following:[5]

  * How they focus their attention or get their energy (Extraversion or Introversion)
  * How they perceive or take in information (Sensing or iNtuition)
  * How they prefer to make decisions (Thinking or Feeling)
  * How they orient themselves to the external world (Judgment or Perception)

By using their preference in each of these areas, people develop what Jung and
Myers called psychological type. This underlying personality pattern results
from the dynamic interaction of their four preferences, in conjunction with
environmental influences and their own individual tendencies. People are
likely to develop behaviors, skills, and attitudes based on their particular
type. Each personality type has its own potential strengths as well as areas
that offer opportunities for growth.

The MBTI tool consists of multiple choice questions that sort respondents on
the basis of the four "dichotomies" (pairs of psychological opposites).
Sixteen different outcomes are possible, each identified by its own four-
letter code, referred to by initial letters. (N is used for iNtuition, to
differentiate it from Introversion). The MBTI is approximately 75% accurate
according to its own manual.[6]

  * I â Introversion preferred to Extraversion: INFPs tend to be quiet and reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social situations (whereas extraverts gain energy).[7]
  * N â iNtuition preferred to Sensing: INFPs tend to be more abstract than concrete. They focus their attention on the big picture rather than the details, and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities.[8]
  * F â Feeling preferred to Thinking: INFPs tend to rely on a personal, internal sense of right and wrong rather than external, objective criteria. When making decisions, they often give more weight to feelings and social considerations than to logic.[9]
  * P â Perception preferred to Judgment: INFPs tend to withhold judgment and delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should circumstances change.[10]

## [edit] Characteristics of INFPs

### [edit] Myers-Briggs description

According to Myers-Briggs,[11] INFPs focus much of their energy on an inner
world dominated by intense feeling and deeply held ethics. They seek an
external life that is in keeping with these values. Loyal to the people and
causes important to them, INFPs can quickly spot opportunities to implement
their ideals. They are curious to understand those around them, and so are
accepting and flexible except when their values are threatened.

### [edit] Keirsey description

According to Keirsey,[12] the tranquil and reserved exterior of the INFP masks
a passionate inner life. Healers care deeply about causes that interest them
and they often pursue those causes with selfless devotion.

Occurring in only about one percent of the population, Healers can easily feel
isolated. They value harmony and integrity in human relationships, seeking
unity of mind, body, and spirit but often find these values to be out of step
with the more concrete pursuits of the rest of the world. Feeling "different,"
they may wonder whether something is wrong with them. But those
differencesâan ethical nature, a devotion to ideals, a commitment to
harmonious interactionâare in fact some of their greatest strengths.

The polite, reserved exterior of INFPs can at first make them difficult to get
to know. They enjoy conversation, however, taking particular delight in the
unusual. When INFPs are in a sociable mood, their humor and charm shine
through. Disposed to like people and to avoid conflict, INFPs tend to make
pleasant company.

Devoted to those in their inner circle, INFPs guard the emotional well-being
of others, consoling those in distress. Guided by their desire for harmony,
INFPs prefer to be flexible unless their ethics are violated. Then, they
become passionate advocates for their beliefs. They are often able to sway the
opinions of others through tact, diplomacy, and an ability to see varying
sides of an issue.

INFPs develop these insights through reflection, and they require substantial
time alone to ponder and process new information. While they can be quite
patient with complex material, they are generally bored by routine. Though not
always organized, INFPs are meticulous about things they value.
Perfectionists, they may have trouble completing a task because it cannot meet
their high standards. They may even go back to a completed project after the
deadline so they can improve it.

INFPs are creative types and often have a gift for language. As introverts,
they may prefer to express themselves through writing. Their dominant Feeling
drives their desire to communicate, while their auxiliary intuition supplies
the imagination. Having a talent for symbolism, they enjoy metaphors and
similes. They continually seek new ideas and adapt well to change. They prefer
working in an environment that values these gifts and allows them to make a
positive difference in the world, according to their personal beliefs.[13]

## [edit] Cognitive functions

Drawing upon Jungian theory, Isabel Myers proposed that for each personality
type, the cognitive functionsâsensing, intuition, thinking, and
feelingâform a hierarchy. This hierarchy represents the person's "default"
pattern of behavior.

The Dominant function is the personality type's preferred role, the one they
feel most comfortable with. The secondary Auxiliary function serves to support
and expand on the Dominant function. If the Dominant is an information
gathering function (sensing or intuition), the Auxiliary is a decision making
function (thinking or feeling), and vice versa. The Tertiary function is less
developed than the Dominant and Auxiliary, but it matures over time, rounding
out the person's abilities. The Inferior function is the personality type's
Achilles' heel. This is the function they are least comfortable with. Like the
Tertiary, the Inferior function strengthens with maturity.[14]

  * Dominant Introverted Feeling (Fi): INFPs live primarily in a rich inner world of emotion.
  * Auxiliary Extraverted Intuition (Ne): INFPs engage the outside world primarily with intuition, adept at seeing the big picture, sensing patterns and the flow of existence from the past toward the future.
  * Tertiary Introverted Sensing (Si): This function gives INFPs a natural inclination toward absent-mindedness and makes them more easily distracted.
  * Inferior Extraverted Thinking (Te): This function helps INFPs focus on external details but, being the inferior function, requires the expenditure of greater energy and is not as reliable.[15]

Later personality researchers (notably Linda V. Berens)[16] added four
additional functions to the descending hierarchy, the so-called "shadow"
functions to which the individual is not naturally inclined but which can
emerge when the person is under stress. For INFP these shadow functions are
(in order):

  * Extraverted Feeling (Fe)
  * Introverted Intuition (Ni)
  * Extraverted Sensing (Se)
  * Introverted Thinking (Ti)

## [edit] Correlation with Enneatype

According to Baron and Wagele, the most common Enneatypes for INFPs are
Romantics and Peace Seekers.[17]
