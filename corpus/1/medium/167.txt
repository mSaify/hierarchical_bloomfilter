Type of site Social Annotations, Highlighting and Social Bookmarking

Current status Active  
Diigo (DEE-go) is a Social bookmarking website which allows signed-up users to
bookmark and tag web-pages. Additionally, it allows users to highlight any
part of a webpage and attach sticky notes to specific highlights or to a whole
page. These annotations can be kept private, shared with a group within Diigo
or a special link forwarded to someone else. The name "Diigo" is an
abbreviation for "Digest of Internet Information, Groups and Other stuff".[1]

The launch of Diigo met with mixed responses from the unimpressed [2] to the
enthusiastic [3]. Diigo beta was listed as one of the top 10 research tools by
CNET in 2006.[4]

Outside the website, Diigo's graphical user interface includes an optional
bookmarklet, or a customizable toolbar, with various search capabilities.
Highlight is enabled by a menu, that can either appear automatically when
content is selected, or be embedded into the Context menu.

A Video Tutorial of Diigo features and capabilities can be found [1] Here
(Official Help Page). Diigo recently acquired web-clipping service Furl for an
undisclosed amount. Furl's parent company is Looksmart. [5] [6]
