The Fabian Society is a British intellectual socialist movement, whose purpose
is to advance the principles of Social democracy via gradualist and reformist,
rather than revolutionary means. It is best known for its initial ground-
breaking work beginning late in the 19th century and continuing up to World
War I. The society laid many of the foundations of the Labour Party and
subsequently affected the policies of states emerging from the decolonisation
of the British Empire, especially India. Today, the society is a vanguard
"think tank" of the Centre-left New Labour movement. It is one of 15 socialist
societies affiliated to the Labour Party. Similar societies exist in Australia
(the Australian Fabian Society), Canada (the Douglas-Coldwell Foundation and
in past the League for Social Reconstruction) and New Zealand.

## [edit] History

The group, which favoured gradual incremental change rather than revolutionary
change, was named â at the suggestion of Frank Podmore â in honour of the
Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus (nicknamed "Cunctator", meaning "the
Delayer"). His Fabian strategy advocated tactics of harassment and attrition
rather than head-on battles against the Carthaginian army under the renowned
general Hannibal Barca.

The society was founded on 4 January 1884 in London as an offshoot of a
society founded in 1883 called The Fellowship of the New Life.[1] Fellowship
members included poets Edward Carpenter and John Davidson, sexologist Havelock
Ellis, and future Fabian secretary, Edward R. Pease. They wanted to transform
society by setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow.
But when some members also wanted to become politically involved to aid
society's transformation, it was decided that a separate society, The Fabian
Society, also be set up. All members were free to attend both societies. The
Fabian Society additionally advocated renewal of Western European Renaissance
ideas, and their promulgation throughout the rest of the world.

The Fellowship of the New Life was dissolved in 1898[2], but the Fabian
Society grew to become the preeminent academic society in the United Kingdom
in the Edwardian era, typified by the members of its vanguard Coefficients
club.

Immediately upon its inception, the Fabian Society began attracting many
prominent contemporary figures drawn to its socialist cause, including George
Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Annie Besant, Graham Wallas, Hubert Bland, Edith
Nesbit, Sydney Olivier, Oliver Lodge, Leonard Woolf and Virginia Woolf, Ramsay
MacDonald and Emmeline Pankhurst. Even Bertrand Russell briefly became a
member, but resigned after he expressed his belief that the Society's
principle of entente (in this case, countries allying themselves against
Germany) could lead to war.

At the core of the Fabian Society were Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Together,
they wrote numerous studies of industrial Britain, including alternative co-
operative economics that applied to ownership of capital as well as land.

The Fabian Society logo of 2008 evoked Aesop's fable, The Tortoise and the
Hare.

The first Fabian Society pamphlets advocating tenets of Social justice
coincided with the zeitgeist of Liberal reforms during the early 1900s. The
Fabian proposals however were considerably more progressive than those that
were enacted in the Liberal reform legislation. The Fabians lobbied for the
introduction of a minimum wage in 1906, for the creation of a Socialised
healthcare system in 1911, and for the abolition of hereditary peerages in
1917[3].

Fabian socialists were in favour of an imperialist foreign policy as a conduit
for internationalist reform and a welfare state modelled on the Bismarckian
German model; they criticised Gladstonian liberalism both for its
individualism at home and its internationalism abroad. They favoured a
national minimum wage in order to stop British industries compensating for
their inefficiency by lowering wages instead of investing in capital
equipment; slum clearances and a health service in order for "the breeding of
even a moderately Imperial race" which would be more productive and better
militarily than the "stunted, anaemic, demoralised denizens...of our great
cities"; and a national education system because "it is in the class-rooms
that the future battles of the Empire for commercial prosperity are already
being lost"[4].

The Fabians also favored the nationalization of land, believing that rents
collected by landowners were unearned, an idea which drew heavily from the
work of American economist Henry George.

Many Fabians participated in the formation of the Labour Party in 1900, and
the group's constitution, written by Sidney Webb, borrowed heavily from the
founding documents of the Fabian Society. At the Labour Party Foundation
Conference in 1900, the Fabian Society claimed 861 members and sent one
delegate.

In the period between the two World Wars, the "Second Generation" Fabians,
including the writers R. H. Tawney, G. D. H. Cole, and Harold Laski, continued
to be a major influence on social-democratic thought.

It was at this time that many of the future leaders of the Third World were
exposed to Fabian thought, most notably India's Jawaharlal Nehru, who
subsequently framed economic policy for India on Fabian social-democratic
lines. Obafemi Awolowo who later became the premier of Nigeria's defunct
Western Region was also a Fabian member in the late 1940s. It was the Fabian
ideology that Awolowo used to run the Western Region but was prevented from
using it on a national level in Nigeria. It is a little-known fact that the
founder of Pakistan, Barrister Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was an avid member of the
Fabian Society in the early 1930s. Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of
Singapore, stated in his memoirs that his initial political philosophy was
strongly influenced by the Fabian Society. However, he later altered his
views, believing the Fabian ideal of socialism to be impractical.

Among many current and former Fabian academics are the political scientist
Bernard Crick, the late economists Thomas Balogh and Nicholas Kaldor, and the
sociologist Peter Townsend.

## [edit] Legacy

Through the course of the 20th century the group has always been influential
in Labour Party circles, with members including Ramsay MacDonald, Clement
Attlee, Anthony Crosland, Richard Crossman, Tony Benn, Harold Wilson, and more
recently Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The late Ben Pimlott served as its
Chairman in the 1990s. (A Pimlott Prize for Political Writing was organized in
his memory by the Fabian Society and The Guardian in 2005, and continues
annually). The Society is affiliated to the Party as a socialist society. In
recent years the Young Fabian group, founded in 1960, has become an important
networking and discussion organisation for younger (under 31) Labour Party
activists and played a role in the 1994 election of Tony Blair as Labour
Leader. Following a period of inactivity, the Scottish Young Fabians were
reformed in 2005.

The society's 2004 annual report showed that there were 5,810 individual
members (down 70 from the previous year), of whom 1,010 were Young Fabians,
and 294 institutional subscribers, of which 31 were Constituency Labour
Parties, co-operative societies, or trade unions, 190 were libraries, 58
corporate, and 15 otherâmaking 6,104 members in total. The society's net
assets were Â£86,057, its total income Â£486,456, and its total expenditure
Â£475,425. There was an overall surplus for the year of Â£1,031.

The latest edition of the Dictionary of National Biography (a reference work
listing details of famous or significant Britons throughout history) includes
174 Fabians.

Four Fabians, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw
founded the London School of Economics with the money left to the Fabian
Society by Henry Hutchinson. Supposedly the decision was made at a breakfast
party on 4 August 1894. The founders are depicted in the Fabian Window[5]
designed by George Bernard Shaw. The window was stolen in 1978 and reappeared
at Sotheby's in 2005. It was restored to display in the Shaw Library at the
London School of Economics in 2006 at a ceremony over which Tony Blair
presided.[6]

### [edit] Young Fabians

Members aged under 31 years of age are also members of the Young Fabians. This
group has its own elected Chair and executive and organizes conferences and
events. It also publishes the quarterly magazine Anticipations. The Scottish
Young Fabians, a Scottish branch of the group, reformed in 2005.

### [edit] Influence on Labour government

Since Labour came to office in 1997, the Fabian Society has been a forum for
New Labour ideas and for critical approaches from across the party. The most
significant Fabian contribution to Labour's policy agenda in government was Ed
Balls' 1992 pamphlet, advocating Bank of England independence. Balls had been
a Financial Times journalist when he wrote this Fabian pamphlet, before going
to work for Gordon Brown. BBC Business Editor Robert Peston, in his book
Brown's Britain, calls this an "essential tract" and concludes that Balls
"deserves as much credit â probably more â than anyone else for the
creation of the modern Bank of England";[7] William Keegan offers a similar
analysis of Balls' Fabian pamphlet in his book on Labour's economic policy,[8]
which traces in detail the path leading up to this dramatic policy change
after Labour's first week in office.

The Fabian Society Tax Commission of 2000 was widely credited[9] with
influencing the Labour government's policy and political strategy for its one
significant public tax increase: the National Insurance rise to raise Â£8
billion for National Health Service spending. (The Fabian Commission had in
fact called for a directly hypothecated "NHS tax"[10] to cover the full cost
of NHS spending, arguing that linking taxation more directly to spending was
essential to make tax rise publicly acceptable. The 2001 National Insurance
rise was not formally hypothecated, but the government committed itself to
using the additional funds for health spending.) Several other
recommendations, including a new top rate of income tax, were to the left of
government policy and not accepted, though this comprehensive review of UK
taxation was influential in economic policy and political circles.[11]

## [edit] Criticism

Leon Trotsky, an influential 20th century revolutionary socialist, wrote that
Fabianism was an attempt to save capitalism from the working class. He wrote
that "throughout the whole history of the British Labour movement there has
been pressure by the bourgeoisie upon the proletariat through the agency of
radicals, intellectuals, drawing-room and church socialists and Owenites who
reject the class struggle and advocate the principle of social solidarity,
preach collaboration with the bourgeoisie, bridle, enfeeble and politically
debase the proletariat.â[12]

In an article published in The Guardian on 14 February 2008, following the
apology offered by Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd to the "stolen
generations", Geoffrey Robertson, writes that Fabian socialists provided the
intellectual justification for the controversial government program for
raising aborigine children away from their parents.[13]
