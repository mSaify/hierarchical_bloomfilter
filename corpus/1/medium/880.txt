An academic discipline, or field of study, is a branch of knowledge which is
taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are
defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is
published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to
which their practitioners belong.

Fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the
distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.

## [edit] Overview

In Medieval Europe, there were only four faculties in a university: Theology,
Medicine, Canon Law and Liberal Arts (Arts).[1] Current-day university
disciplines have their roots in the mid- to late-19th century secularization
of universities, when the traditional curricula were supplemented with non-
classical languages and literatures, social sciences such as political
science, economics and public administration, and by natural science and
technology disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.

In the early 20th century, new disciplines such as education, sociology, and
psychology were added. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an explosion of new
disciplines focusing on specific themes, such as media studies, women's
studies, and Black studies. Many disciplines designed as preparation for
careers and professions, such as nursing, hospitality management, and
corrections also emerged in the universities. Finally, the visibility of such
interdisciplinary scientific fields as biochemistry and geophysics increased,
as their contribution to knowledge became widely recognized.

An asterisk ("*") denotes a field whose academic status is debated.

Note that the area into which some fields should be classified is debated,
such as whether anthropology and linguistics are social sciences disciplines
or humanities disciplines. Note that some people, particularly critical
theorists are critical of the division of disciplines; and virtually every
division of disciplines, as well as the structure of the concept of
disciplines in general, is disputed by some.

A provocative question to ask might be "how many disciplines of study are
there?" And an answer to this question could reasonably be that there is no
end to the amount of academic disciplines one could have.

In academia today, it is a growing practice to incorporate fields of study
that are created by extending the ideas, theories, and methods of more
traditional disciplines. Also, new times and revolutionary thinkers can
enhance or renew existing disciplines, or even create new disciplines
altogether. For example, it can be argued that Freud created a new sub-field
of psychology with his new perspective of psychoanalysis.
