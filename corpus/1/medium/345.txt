Look up faux pas in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

A faux pas (pronounced /ËfoÊËpÉË/, plural: faux pas /ËfoÊËpÉË(z)/)
is a violation of accepted social rules (for example, standard customs or
etiquette rules)[1]. Faux pas vary widely from culture to culture, and what is
considered good manners in one culture can be considered a faux pas in
another. The term comes originally from French, and literally means "false
step"[2].

This expression is usually used in social and diplomatic contexts. The term
has been in use in English for some time and is no longer italicized when
written. In French, it is employed literally to describe a physical loss of
balance as well as figuratively, in which case the meaning is roughly the same
as in English. Other familiar synonyms include gaffe and bourde (bourde,
unlike faux pas, can designate any type of mistake)[3]
