## [edit] In Behavior Therapy

To behaviourists, social skills are learned behavior that allow people to
achieve social reinforcement and to avoid social punishment.[1] According to
Schneider & Bryne (1985), who conducted a meta-analysis of social skills
training procedures (51 studies), operant conditioning procedures for training
social skills had the largest effect size, followed by modeling, coaching, and
social cognitive techniques. [2]
