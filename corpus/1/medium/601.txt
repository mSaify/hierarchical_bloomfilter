Kurt Zadek Lewin (September 9, 1890 - February 12, 1947), a German-born
psychologist, is one of the modern pioneers of social, organizational, and
applied psychology.[1]

Lewin is often recognized as the "founder of social psychology" and was one of
the first researchers to study group dynamics and organizational development.

## [edit] Biography

In 1890, he was born into a Jewish family in Mogilno, Poland (then in County
of Mogilno, province of Posen, Prussia). He served in the German army when
World War I began. Due to a war wound, he returned to the University of Berlin
to complete his Ph.D., with Carl Stumpf (1848 - 1936) the supervisor of his
doctoral thesis. He died in Newtonville, Massachusetts of a heart-attack in
1947. He was buried in his home town.

Lewin had originally been involved with schools of behavioral psychology
before changing directions in research and undertaking work with psychologists
of the Gestalt school of psychology, including Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang
Kohler. Lewin often associated with the early Frankfurt School, originated by
an influential group of largely Jewish Marxists at the Institute for Social
Research in Germany. But when Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 the
Institute members had to disband, moving to England and then to America. In
that year, he met with Eric Trist, of the London Tavistock Clinic. Trist was
impressed with his theories and went on to use them in his studies on soldiers
during the Second World War.

Lewin emigrated to the United States in August 1933 and became a naturalized
citizen in 1940. Lewin worked at Cornell University and for the Iowa Child
Welfare Research Station at the University of Iowa. Later, he went on to
become director of the Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. While working with at
MIT in 1946, Lewin received a phone call from the Director of the Connecticut
State Inter Racial Commission requesting help to find an effective way to
combat religious and racial prejudices. He set up a workshop to conduct a
'change' experiment, which laid the foundations for what is now known as
sensitivity training. In 1947, this led to the establishment of the National
Training Laboratories, at Bethel, Maine. Carl Rogers believed that sensitivity
training is "perhaps the most significant social invention of this century."

Following WWII Lewin was involved in the psychological rehabilitation of
former occupants of displaced persons camps with Dr. Jacob Fine at Harvard
Medical School. When Eric Trist and A T M Wilson wrote to Lewin proposing a
journal in partnership with their newly founded Tavistock Institute and his
group at MIT, Lewin agreed. The Tavistock journal, Human Relations, was
founded with two early papers by Lewin entitled "Frontiers in Group Dynamics".
Lewin taught for a time at Duke University.[2]

## [edit] Work

Lewin coined the notion of genidentity,[3] which has gained some importance in
various theories of space-time and related fields. He also proposed Herbert
Blumer's interactionist perspective of 1937 as an alternative to the nature
versus nurture debate. Lewin suggested that neither nature (inborn tendencies)
nor nurture (how experiences in life shape individuals) alone can account for
individuals' behavior and personalities, but rather that both nature and
nurture interact to shape each person. This idea was presented in the form of
Lewin's Equation for behavior B=Æ(P,E).

Prominent psychologists mentored by Kurt Lewin included Leon Festinger (1919 -
1989), who became known for his cognitive dissonance theory (1956),
environmental psychologist Roger Barker, Bluma Zeigarnik, and Morton Deutsch,
the founder of modern conflict resolution theory and practice.

### [edit] Force field analysis

Force field analysis is one of the most influential developments in the field
of social science. It provides a framework for looking at the factors (forces)
that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces
that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking
movement toward a goal (hindering forces). The principle, developed by Kurt
Lewin, is a significant contribution to the fields of social science,
psychology, social psychology, organizational development, process management,
and change management.[4]

### [edit] Action research

Lewin, then a professor at MIT, first coined the term âaction researchâ in
about 1944, and it appears in his 1946 paper âAction Research and Minority
Problemsâ.[5] In that paper, he described action research as âa
comparative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social
action and research leading to social actionâ that uses âa spiral of
steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action, and fact-
finding about the result of the actionâ.

### [edit] Leadership climates

Lewin often characterized organizational management styles and cultures in
terms of leadership climates defined by (1) authoritarian, (2) democratic and
(3) laissez-faire work environments. Authoritarian environments are
characterized where the leader determines policy with techniques and steps for
work tasks dictated by the leader in the division of labor. The leader is not
necessarily hostile but is aloof from participation in work and commonly
offers personal praise and criticism for the work done. Democratic climates
are characterized where policy is determined through collective processes with
decisions assisted by the leader. Before accomplishing tasks, perspectives are
gained from group discussion and technical advice from a leader. Members are
given choices and collectively decide the division of labor. Praise and
criticism in such an environment are objective, fact minded and given by a
group member without necessarily having participated extensively in the actual
work. Laissez faire environments give freedom to the group for policy
determination without any participation from the leader. The leader remains
uninvolved in work decisions unless asked, does not participate in the
division of labor, and very infrequently gives praise. (Miner 2005: 39-40) [6]

### [edit] Change process

An early model of change developed by Lewin described change as a three-stage
process. The first stage he called "unfreezing". It involved overcoming
inertia and dismantling the existing "mind set". Defense mechanisms have to be
bypassed. In the second stage the change occurs. This is typically a period of
confusion and transition. We are aware that the old ways are being challenged
but we do not have a clear picture as to what we are replacing them with yet.
The third and final stage he called "freezing". The new mindset is
crystallizing and one's comfort level is returning to previous levels. This is
often misquoted as "refreezing" (see Lewin K (1947) Frontiers in Group
Dynamics).

### [edit] Lewin's equation

The Lewin's Equation, B=Æ(P,E), is a psychological equation of behavior
developed by Kurt Lewin. It states that behavior is a function of the person
and his or her environment [7].

The equation is the psychologist's most well known formula in social
psychology, of which Lewin was a modern pioneer. When first presented in
Lewin's book Principles of Topological Psychology, published in 1936, it
contradicted most popular theories in that it gave importance to a person's
momentary situation in understanding his or her behavior, rather than relying
entirely on the past. [8]
