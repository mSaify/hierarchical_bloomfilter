Enterprise social software, also known as Enterprise 2.0, is a term describing
social software used in "enterprise" (business) contexts. It includes social
and networked modifications to company intranets and other classic software
platforms used by large companies to organize their communication. In contrast
to traditional enterprise software, which imposes structure prior to use,
enterprise social software tends to encourage use prior to providing
structure.

The Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM) defines Enterprise
2.0 as "a system of web-based technologies that provide rapid and agile
collaboration, information sharing, emergence and integration capabilities in
the extended enterprise".[1]

## [edit] Terminology

The term "enterprise social software" generally describes this class of tools.
As of 2006, "Enterprise 2.0" had become a catchier term, sometimes used to
describe social and networked changes to enterprises, which often includes
social software (but may transcend social software, social collaboration and
software).

"Enterprise Web 2.0" sometimes describes the introduction and implementation
of Web 2.0 technologies within an enterprise,[citation needed] including rich
Internet applications, providing software as a service, and using the web as a
general platform.

## [edit] Applications of enterprise social software

### [edit] Functionality

Social software for an enterprise must according to Andrew McAfee (Associate
Professor, Harvard Business School) have the following functionality to work
well (McAfee 2006):  
\- Search: allow users to search for other users or content  
\- Links: group similar users or content together  
\- Authoring: include blogs and wikis  
\- Tags: allow users to tag content  
\- Extensions: recommendations of users or content based on profile  
\- Signals: allow people to subscribe to users or content with RSS feeds  
[cite this quote]

McAfee recommends installing easy-to-use software which does not impose any
rigid structure on users. He envisages an informal roll-out,[citation needed]
but on a common platform to enable future collaboration between areas. He also
recommends strong and visible managerial support to achieve this.

In 2007 Dion Hinchcliffe expanded the list above by adding the following four
functions:  
\- Freeform: no barriers to authorship, i.e. free from a learning curve or
restrictions.  
\- Network-oriented: all content must be Web-addressable.  
\- Social: stresses transparency (to access), diversity (in content and
community members) and openness (to structure)  
\- Emergence: must provide approaches that detect and leverage the collective
wisdom of the community.  
[cite this quote]

### [edit] Software examples

Specific social software tools which programmers have adapted for enterprise
use include:

  * hypertext and unstructured search tools
  * wikis
  * weblogs for storytelling
  * social bookmarking for tagging and building organizational folksonomies
  * RSS for signaling
  * collaborative planning software for peer-based project planning and management
  * ideas banks for ideation (idea generation)
  * social networking tools
  * mashups for visualization
  * prediction markets for forecasting and identifying risks.

Social networking capabilities can help organizations capture unstructured
tacit knowledge.[citation needed] The challenge then becomes how to distill
meaningful, re-usable knowledge from other content also captured in tools such
as blogs, online communities, and wikis. In 2008, companies that provide
enterprise social software started introducing profile pages to their
products, to integrate the functionality of public online communities within
the enterprise.[citation needed] This enables knowledge workers to find others
with the knowledge they may need.[citation needed] This is especially useful
in large organizations.[citation needed]

### [edit] Specific uses

Blogs and wikis function as collaboration tools, and as such, they have uses
mainly in sharing "unstructured" information associated with ad hoc or ongoing
projects and processes, but not for "structured informational" retrieval.
However, Shell has started converting its official documentation to wikis,
because this enables that company to make documentation updates available in
real time and allows non-editors to contribute to the documentation. In this
process Shell restructures the paper documents to a set of on-line wiki pages.

Business processes often rely on access to "structured" data, potentially from
a variety of sources: databases, and directories. Social technologies work to
address such complexities.[citation needed]

The "unstructured" information provided by social technologies has proven
particularly useful in business processes that lack rigid pre-definition, but
where people work together in an adaptive way to innovate solutions. Human
interaction management provides the theory of such processes, and the
associated type of software has become known as human interaction management
systems (HIMS). A HIMS can provide management control over the use of social
software.

A Service Network exemplifies another application of enterprise social
software within the context of service innovation initiatives that span
academia, business, and government.

The law, which many[who?] view as a field where professionals operate highly
"un-collaboratively", may become among the first areas to embrace Web 2.0 in
the enterprise (if anyone ever does), because lawyers manage intensive
document-collaboration, and sit in both large legal departments within
corporations and in outside law firms.

Enterprise search differs from a typical web search in its focus on "use
within an organization by employees seeking information held internally, in a
variety of formats and locations, including databases, document management
systems, and other repositories".[2]
