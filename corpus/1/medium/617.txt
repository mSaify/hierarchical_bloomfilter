The proletariat (from Latin prollees, "offspring") is a term used to identify
a lower social class; a member of such a class is proletarian. Originally it
was identified as those people who had no wealth other than their sons. The
term was initially used in a derogatory sense, until Karl Marx used it as a
sociological term to refer to the working class.

## [edit] The Proletariat in Marxist theory

In Marxist theory, the proletariat is that class of a capitalist society which
does not have ownership of the means of production and whose only means of
subsistence is to sell their labor for a wage or salary. Proletarians are
wage-workers, while some refer to those who receive salaries as the salariat.
For Marx, however, wage labor may involve getting a salary rather than a wage
per se.

Marxism sees the proletariat and bourgeoisie (capitalist class) as occupying
conflicting positions, since (for example) factory workers automatically wish
wages to be as high as possible, while owners and their proxies wish for wages
(costs) to be as low as possible.

In Marxist theory, the borders between the proletariat and (1) some layers of
the petite bourgeoisie, who rely primarily but not exclusively on self-
employment at an income no different from an ordinary wage or below it; and
(2) the lumpen proletariat, who are not in legal employment; are not
necessarily well defined. Intermediate positions are possible, where some
wage-labor for an employer combines with self-employment. Socialist political
parties have often struggled over the question of whether they should seek to
organize and represent the entire proletariat, or just the wage-earning
working class.

According to Marxism, capitalism is a system based on the exploitation of the
proletariat by the bourgeoisie (the "capitalists", who own and control the
means of production). This exploitation takes place as follows: the workers,
who own no means of production of their own, must use the means of production
that are property of others in order to produce, and, consequently, earn their
life. Instead of hiring those means of production, they themselves get hired
by capitalists and work for them, producing goods or services. These goods or
services become the property of the capitalist, who sells them at the market.
One part of the wealth produced is used to pay the workers' wages (variable
capital), another part to renew the means of production (constant capital)
while the third part (surplus value) is split between the capitalist's private
takings (profit), and the money used to pay rents, taxes, and interests, etc.
A part of the surplus value is also used to increase the means of production,
either in quantity or quality (ie, it is turned into capital), and is called
capitalised surplus value[1]. The commodities proletarians make, and
capitalists sell, are valued for the amount of labour embodied in them. The
same goes for the labour force itself: it is valued, not for the amount of
wealth it produces, but for the amount of labour necessary to produce and
reproduce it. The difference between the wealth the proletariat produces
through its work, and the wealth it consumes in order to survive and provide
labour force to the capitalist companies, is called surplus value[2].

Thus the capitalists earn money (profit) from the labor of their employees,
not as a function of their personal contribution to the productive process
(which may even be null), but as a function of the juridical relation of
property of the means of production. Marxists argue that new wealth is created
through labor applied to natural resources[3]; therefore, if someone gains
wealth through the monopoly of means of production, then those who work to
produce that wealth do not not receive the full wealth created by their labor,
nor do they have a say in the use of the wealth appropriated by the
proprietors of means of production. In other words, the workers are exploited.
Thus, Marxists argue that capitalists make a profit by exploiting the
proletariat.

Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace
the capitalist system with socialism, changing the social relationships
underpinning the class system and then developing into a communist society in
which: "..the free development of each is the condition for the free
development of all" (Communist Manifesto)[4].

Marx makes a clear distinction of proletariat as salaried workers, which he
sees a progressive class, with Lumpen proletariat, "rag-proletariat", the
poorest and outcasts of the society, such as beggars, tricksters,
entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes, which he considers a
retrograde class[5][6].

## [edit] Other Uses

Arnold J. Toynbee uses the term "internal" and "external proletariat" in his
monumental "A Study of History" to describe the groups within and external to
the frontiers of the state, who during the time of troubles, the World Empire
and the decay of a civilization, are progressively disenfranchised, and come
to have little loyalty to the survival of that civilization.
