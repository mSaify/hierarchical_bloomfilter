## [edit] History

### [edit] Origins

Salesforce.com was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff. In
June 2004, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the
stock symbol CRM. Initial investors in salesforce.com were Marc Benioff, Larry
Ellison, Halsey Minor, Magdalena Yesil and Igor Sill, Geneva Venture Partners.

### [edit] Current status

Salesforce.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with regional
headquarters in Dublin (covering Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Singapore
(covering Asia Pacific less Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan). Other major
offices are in Toronto, New York, London, Sydney, and San Mateo, California.
Salesforce.com has its services translated into 16[3] different languages and
currently has 55,400[4] customers and over 1,500,000[5] subscribers. In 2008,
Salesforce.com ranked 43rd on the list of largest software companies in the
world.[6]

  
Following the Federal takeover of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in September
2008, the S&P 500 removed the two mortgage giants after Wednesday, September
10, 2008, and added Fastenal and Salesforce.com to the index, effective after
Friday, September 12, 2008.[7]

### [edit] Acquisitions

The following is a complete list of acquisitions by salesforce.com:

  * Sendia[8] (April 2006) for US$15 million in cash[9] â now Force.com Mobile
  * Kieden[10] (August 2006) â now Salesforce for Google AdWords
  * Kenlet[11] (January 2007) â Original product CrispyNews used at Salesforce IdeaExchange[12] and Dell IdeaStorm [13]. Now relaunched as Salesforce Ideas.
  * Koral (March 2007) â now Salesforce Content
  * Instranet (August 2008) â now rebranded to Salesforce Knowledge

### [edit] Security issues

In November 2007, a successful phishing attack compromised contact information
on a number of salesforce.com customers, which was then used to send highly-
targeted phishing emails to Salesforce users. [14]

## [edit] Products and Services

### [edit] Customer Relationship Management

Salesforce.com's CRM solution is broken down into several applications: Sales,
Service & Support, Partner Relationship Management, Marketing, Content, Ideas
and Analytics.

### [edit] Force.com Platform

Salesforce.com's Platform-as-a-Service product is known as the Force.com
Platform. The platform allows external developers to create add-on
applications that integrate into the main Salesforce application and are
hosted on salesforce.com's infrastructure.

These applications are built using Apex (a proprietary Java-like programming
language for the Force.com Platform) and Visualforce (an XML-like syntax for
building user interfaces in HTML, AJAX or Flex).

### [edit] AppExchange

Launched in 2005, AppExchange is a directory of applications built for
Salesforce by third-party developers which users can purchase and add to their
Salesforce environment. As of September 2008, there are over 800[15]
applications available from over 450 ISVs.

### [edit] Customization

Salesforce users can customize their CRM application. In the system, there are
tabs such as "Contacts", "Reports", and "Accounts". Each tab contains
associated information. For example, "Contacts" has fields like First Name,
Last Name, Email, etc. ....

Customization can be done on each tab, by adding user-defined custom fields.
[16]

Customization can also be done at the "platform" level by adding customized
applications to a Salesforce.com instance, that is adding sets of customized /
novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources,
etc) features.

### [edit] Web Services

In addition to the web interface, Salesforce offers a Web Services API that
enables integration with other systems. Soon Salesforce will release a slimmed
down version for their subscribers for use with Blackberry mobile phones.

### [edit] Languages

English, Dutch, Spanish, German, French, Finnish, Swedish, Japanese, Italian,
Portuguese (Brazilian), Korean, Russian, Thai, Danish, Simplified Chinese and
Traditional Chinese. Application and online help & training documentation are
available in these languages.

Also, end user languages are available in Hungarian, Czech, Turkish, Polish,
Lithuanian, Latvian & Estonian.

### [edit] Other

Other technologies in use at salesforce.com are Resin Application Server, and
the in-house technologies Apex (a Java-like programming language and
programming platform) and S-controls (Salesforce widgets - these are
predominantly based on JavaScript).
