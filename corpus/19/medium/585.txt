Beamer is a LaTeX class for creating slides for presentations. It works
together with pdflatex, dvips and LyX. The name is taken from the German word
"Beamer", a pseudo-anglicism for video projector.

The Beamer class is not the first LaTeX class for creating presentations, and
like many of its predecessors, it has special syntax for defining 'slides'
(known in Beamer as 'frames'). Slides can be built up on-screen in stages as
if by revealing text that was previously hidden or covered. This is handled
with PDF output by creating successive pages that preserve the layout but add
new elements, so that advancing to the next page in the PDF file appears to
add something to the displayed page, when in fact it has redrawn the page.

Beamer provides the ability to make 'handouts', that is a version of the
output suitable for printing, without the dynamic features, so that the
printed version of a slide shows the final version that will appear during the
presentation. An "article" version is also available, rendered on standard
sized paper (like A4 or letter), with frame titles used as paragraph titles,
no special slide layout/colors, keeping the sectioning. This version is
suitable for lecture notes or for having a single source file for an article
and the slides for the talk about this article.

Beamer relies on PGF for some of its features.
