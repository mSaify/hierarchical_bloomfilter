3D computer graphics software refers to programs used to create 3D computer-
generated imagery. There are typically many stages in the "pipeline" that
studios use to create 3D objects for film and games, and this article only
covers some of the software used. Note that most of the 3D packages have a
very plugin-oriented architecture, and high-end plugins costing tens or
hundreds of thousands of dollars are often used by studios. Larger studios
usually create enormous amounts of proprietary software to run alongside these
programs.

## [edit] Features

Many 3D modelers are general-purpose and can be used to produce models of
various real-world entities, from plants to automobiles to people. Some are
specially designed to model certain objects, such as chemical compounds or
internal organs.

3D modelers allow users to create and alter models via their 3D mesh. Users
can add, subtract, stretch and otherwise change the mesh to their desire.
Models can be viewed from a variety of angles, usually simultaneously. Models
can be rotated and the view can be zoomed in and out.

3D modelers can export their models to files, which can then be imported into
other applications as long as the metadata is compatible. Many modelers allow
importers and exporters to be plugged-in, so they can read and write data in
the native formats of other applications.

Most 3D modelers contain a number of related features, such as ray tracers and
other rendering alternatives and texture mapping facilities. Some also contain
features that support or allow animation of models. Some may be able to
generate full-motion video of a series of rendered scenes (i.e. animation).

## [edit] Uses

3D modelers are used in a wide variety of industries. The medical industry
uses them to create detailed models of organs. The movie industry uses them to
create and manipulate characters and objects for animated and real-life motion
pictures. The video game industry uses them to create assets for video games.
The science sector uses them to create highly detailed models of chemical
compounds. The architecture industry uses them to create models of proposed
buildings and landscapes. The engineering community uses them to design new
devices, vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses.

## [edit] Major packages

A basic comparison including release date/version information can be found on
the Comparison of 3D computer graphics software page. A comprehensive
comparison of significant 3D packages can be found at CG Society Wiki and
TDT3D 3D applications 2007 comparisons table..

  * 3ds Max (Autodesk), originally called 3D Studio MAX. 3ds Max is used in many industries that utilize 3D graphics. It is used in the video game industry for developing models and creating cinema cut-scenes. It is used in architectural visualizations because it is highly compatible with AutoCAD\--also developed by Autodesk. Additionally 3ds Max is used in film production, one contemporary film being Kaena: The Prophecy[1]. With its price of around $3500 USD, it is one of the more expensive products in the market for this type of work. 3ds Max is available for Windows.

  * AC3D (Inivis) is another 3D modeling application that began in the 90's on the Amiga platform. While it is used in a number of industries, MathWorks actively recommends it in many of their aerospace related articles[2] due to price and compatibility. Additionally it is the first commercial 3D modeler to integrate full support for exporting models to the metaverse platform Second Life. AC3D is priced in the range of $79 USD and is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. While AC3D does not feature its own renderer, it can generate output files for both RenderMan and POV-Ray among others.

  * Aladdin4D (DiscreetFX), first developed for the Amiga, was originally developed by Adspec Programming in Ohio. It developed an enthusiastic following and sold over 18,000 copies on the Amiga platform alone{cite}. After being acquired by visual effects company DiscreetFX, the package has finally been repositioned as a multi-platform product for Mac OS X, Amiga OS 4.1, MorphOS, Linux, AROS and Windows. It is priced at $99.95 USD and is available for Windows, Linux, MorphOS, Amiga OS 4 and AROS.

  * Blender (Blender Foundation) is a free, open-source, 3D studio for animation, modeling, rendering, and texturing offering a feature set comparable to commercial 3D animation suites such as Maya, 3ds Max, or Cinema 4D. It includes features such as multi-resolution sculpting; retopology painting. Additionally it supports 3D view texture painting; stack based modifier system; flexible particle system with particle based hair; cloth/soft body dynamics, rigid body dynamics and fluid simulation; node based texturing and node based compositing; an integrated non linear video editor; and integrated game engine. Blender is developed under the GPL and is available on all major platforms including Windows, OS X, Linux, BSD, Sun and Irix. It is currently the only 3D animation suite that is supported both on super computers as well as handheld computers such as the Pocket PC (Pocket Blender).

  * Cinema 4D (MAXON) is a slightly lighter package than the others in its basic configuration. The software is claimed to be artist-friendly, and is designed with the less-technical user in mind. It has a lower initial entry cost due to a modular a-la-carte design for purchasing additional functions as users need them. For example, a module called BodyPaint allows artists to draw textures directly onto the surface of models. Originally developed for the Commodore Amiga, it is also available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.

  * Electric Image Animation System (EI Technology Group) is a 3D animation and rendering package available on both Mac OS X and Windows. Mostly known for its rendering quality and rendering speed it does not include a built-in modeler. EIAS features the ability to handle very large polygon counts. Recently, the blockbuster film "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"[3] and the Television hit "Lost"[4] utilized the software.

  * formâ¢Z (AutoDesSys, Inc.) is a general purpose solid/surface 3D modeler. Its primary usage is modeling, and it also features photo realistic rendering and object-centric animation support. formâ¢Z claims users involved in architecture, interior design, illustration, product design, and set design. Its default renderer uses the LightWorks rendering engine for raytracing and radiosity. formâ¢Z also supports Plugins and Scripts and has rendering support via Next Limit's Maxwell Renderer. It has Import/Export capabilities and was first released in 1991. It is currently available for both Mac OS X and Windows. The price for this software ranges from $1495-$1995 USD based on output quality.

  * Houdini (Side Effects Software) is used for visual effects, and character animation as well as used in Disney's The Wild[5]. Houdini uses a nonstandard interface that it refers to as a "NODE system". Commercial licenses of Houdini include unlimited copies of Side Effects Software's hybrid micropolygon-raytracer renderer, Mantra, but Houdini also has built-in support for commercial renderers like Pixar's RenderMan and mental ray. There are two versions of Houdini, Houdini Escape ($1,995 USD) and Houdini Master ($7,995 USD). For non-commercial users, Side Effects Software offers the free Houdini Apprentice personal learning edition, which places a small watermark on images, and Houdini Apprentice HD, a $99 USD package that does not watermark renders.

  * Hypershot is used for photo realistic rendering of 3D models with a high resolution background and environment allowing realtime adjustments and visual feedback. The possibility to include high resolution backdrops has had extensive take-up by the automotive photography industry and with the animation of the model has moved into engineering and product design areas replacing or delaying the need for prototyping.

  * LightWave 3D (NewTek), first developed for the Amiga, was originally bundled as part of the Video Toaster package and entered the market as a low cost way for TV production companies to create quality CG for their programming. It first gained public attention with its use in the TV series "Babylon 5"[6]. Contemporary use in TV and movie production can be seen with the 2004 recreated Battlestar Galactica series[7], CSI: Crime Scene Investigation[8] and the film 300 (film)[9]. It is priced at $795 USD and is available for both Windows and Mac OS X.

  * Massive is a 3D animation system for generating crowd-related visual effects, targeted for use in film and television. Originally developed for controlling the large-scale CGI battles in the Lord of the Rings[10], Massive Software has become an industry standard for digital crowd control in high end animation. Recently, the software has been utilized for blockbuster feature films including Happy Feet, King Kong, and I, Robot. It is available for various Unix and Linux platforms as well as Windows.

  * Maya (Autodesk) is currently used in the film and television industry. Maya has a high learning curve but has developed over the years into an application platform in and of itself through extendability via its MEL programming language. A common alternative to using the default built in rendering system named mental ray is Pixar's Renderman. In 2005, Autodesk (makers of AutoCAD), acquired Alias\--the original creator of Maya[11]. Maya comes in two versions: Maya Complete ($1999 USD) and Maya Unlimited ($4995 USD). There is also Maya Personal Learning Edition, which is for non-commercial use and puts watermarks on any rendered images.

It has a pro version which supports 2-D and 3-D model export functions among other features, which is currently priced at $495 USD. It also has a free version that is integrated with Google Earth and limits export to Google's "3D Warehouse", where users can share their content.

  * Softimage (Autodesk) is feature-similar to Maya and is sold as a competitive alternative. It is used in the production of professional films, commercials, video games, and other media. Softimage (formerly Softimage|XSI) is a 3D modeling and animation package that integrates with mental ray rendering. Prior to its acquisition by Avid and later Autodesk, Softimage, Co. originally promoted its predecessor (under the name Softimage 3D) for use in the video game industry and secured its promotion as part of the Nintendo N64 SDK[12].

  * solidThinking (solidThinking Ltd) is a 3D solid/surface modeling and rendering software which features a Construction Tree method of development. This is explained as the history of the model construction process allowes real-time updates when modifications are made to points, curves, parameters or entire objects. solidThinking is available in four versions: MODELER, MODELER XL, DESIGN, and VANTAGE.

  * SolidWorks (SolidWorks Corporation) is a series of packages used mainly for virtual testing of a product. It includes modeling, assembly, drawing, sheetmetal, weldments, and freeform surfacing. It also has support for custom programming/scripting in Visual Basic and C. The licenses/packages are SolidWorks, SolidWorks Office, SolidWorks Office Professional, SolidWorks Office Premium, SolidWorks Student Design Kit, SolidWorks Education Edition, and SolidWorks Student Edition.
