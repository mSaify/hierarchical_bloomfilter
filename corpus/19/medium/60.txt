Filename extension `.mkv .mka .mks`  
Internet media type `video/x-matroska audio/x-matroska`  
Developed by Matroska.org  
Type of format Container format  
Container for Multimedia  
The Matroska Multimedia Container is an open standard free container format, a
file format that can hold an unlimited number of video, audio, picture or
subtitle tracks inside a single file.[1] It is intended to serve as a
universal format for storing common multimedia content, like movies or TV
shows. Matroska is similar in conception to other containers like AVI, MP4 or
ASF, but is entirely open in specification, with implementations consisting
mostly of open source software. Matroska file types are .MKV for video (with
subtitles and audio), .MKA for audio-only files and .MKS for subtitles only.
The most common use of .MKV files is to store HD video files.

Matroska is an English word derived from the Russian word "matryoshka"
(Russian: Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÑÐºÐ°, IPA: [mÉËtrÊ²oÊkÉ]), which means "nesting
doll" (the common Russian egg-shaped doll within a doll). This is a play on
the container (media within a form of media/doll within a doll) aspect of the
matryoshka as it is a container for visual and audio data. The transliteration
may be confusing for Russian speakers, as the Russian word "matroska"
(Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐºÐ°) actually refers to a sailor suit.

## [edit] History

The project was announced on December 7, 2002 as a fork of the Multimedia
Container Format (MCF), after disagreements between MCF lead developer Lasse
KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen and soon-to-be Matroska founder Steve Lhomme about the use of the
Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML) instead of a binary format. This
coincided with a long coding break by the MCF's lead developer, during which
most of the community quickly migrated to the new project.

## [edit] Goals

The use of EBML provides extendability for future format changes. The Matroska
team has openly expressed some of their long term goals on Doom9.org and
hydrogenaudio.org.

List of Goals

  * creating a modern, flexible, extensible, cross-platform multimedia container format;
  * developing robust streaming support;
  * developing a "DVD-like" menu system based on EBML;
  * developing a set of tools for the creation and editing of Matroska files;
  * developing libraries that can be used to allow developers to add Matroska support to their applications;
  * working with hardware manufacturers to include Matroska support in embedded multimedia devices;
  * working to provide native Matroska support in various operating systems.

## [edit] Software support

Listed below is software that has native Matroska support.

## [edit] Hardware support

<IMG>

This section may need to be updated. Please update this section to reflect
recent events or newly available information, and remove this template when
finished. Please see the talk page for more information.  
A number of set-top boxes such as the Popcorn Hour and EGreat[4] NMT's and
DVICO TVIX media players have stated publicly in user forums that they are
considering or pursuing Matroska support. Some end users in these public
forums report partial success in use with certain codecs and files. The first
chipset to include Matroska Video support has been released by Texas
Instruments under the name "DaVinci". It is used in the Cowon A3 portable
media player. Although an increasing number of standalone players now support
the AVI format, thus far Matroska support is practically nonexistent. Support
in this area is essential for the container to achieve the degree of ubiquity
foreseen by its proponents. There is a sort of "chicken and egg" logjam where
the manufacturers hesitate to support it because it is not widely used, and it
is not widely used because of very limited hardware support.

### [edit] Samsung LCD and LED TV

The Matroska format is supported by many new Samsung LCD and LED Televisions.
Matroska support has been confirmed in the 2009 6 Series (LE40B650) and 7
series (UE40B7020) range of televisions. Matroska files can be played out of
the box on these televisions directly from USB flash drives or HDD based
storage devices when connected to the television's USB slot.

### [edit] Zensonic

The Matroska homepage indicated in an April 2006 posting that playback on
settop devices would be forthcoming starting with the release of the Zensonic
Z500 media player, but the Zensonic company never implemented Matroska
support. Zensonic Changed the company name to Ziova http://www.ziova.com and
have since released the CS-615 which has Matroska support.

### [edit] Sigma Designs

Sigma Designs do not contain any built in support for Matroska, though some
OEMs (such as Western Digital) do provide support in their firmware packages.

### [edit] Cowon

The Cowon A3,O2 supports Matroska as well as many other formats, including the
Ogg Vorbis and FLAC open audio formats. Aspects of the Matroska supported is
that of multiple audio tracks. If the Matroska file has chapters or subtitles,
then these features are not accessible, however, the movie plays as normal.
Subtitles in the SubRip (.srt) or SAMI (.smi) format load automatically with
the movie once the subtitles are in the same folder and has the same name as
the movie.[5]

## [edit] Content in Matroska

Initially the uptake of the format was low. It was initially used almost
exclusively for DVD rips of anime, as the container allowed the viewer to
choose between the original language track and a dub. In recent years,
however, Matroska has seen wider use due to the scene adopting it as a format
of choice for high definition content ripped from HDTV and next generation
video discs (HD DVD and Blu-ray). It usually carries H.264 video, one or more
AC3/AAC/DTS audio tracks and sometimes one or more subtitle tracks (sometimes
coupled with one or more embedded TrueType or OpenType font). Before H.264,
most Matroska files from the above mentioned scene contained RealVideo (RV9,
RV10) encoded video tracks, which at that time was slightly superior to MPEG-4
Part 2[citation needed] (used e.g. by the DivX, Xvid and FFmpeg MPEG-4
codecs), especially for anime material, in combination with MP3 or Vorbis
encoded audio streams and soft-subtitles.[citation needed]

## [edit] License

Matroska is an open standards project. This means it is free to use, and that
the technical specifications describing the bit stream are open to anybody,
including companies that would like to support it in their products. The
source code of the libraries developed by the Matroska Development Team is
licensed under GNU LGPL. In addition to that, there are also free parsing and
playback libraries available under the BSD license, for proprietary hardware
and software adoption.
