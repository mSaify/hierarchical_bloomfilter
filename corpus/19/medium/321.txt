Banshee is a media player that is built upon Mono and Gtk#. It uses the

formats, including Ogg Vorbis, MP3 and FLAC. Banshee can play, import, and
burn audio CDs, and supports many portable media players, including Apple's
iPod, T-Mobile G1 and Creative's ZEN players, in the current version.[2] Music
stored on the iPod can be played without synchronization, and album art stored
in the Banshee library is transferred to the iPod. Support for MTP and
PlaysForSure devices, as well as the Rio Karma player is planned for the near
future.

## [edit] Helix Banshee

Helix Banshee is a version of Banshee, included in SLED and available in
openSUSE (non-OSS media). It is based upon the Banshee core, but adds support
for the Helix framework for playback and transcoding, in addition to
GStreamer. Helix Banshee does not modify the core of Banshee in any way, it
simply builds upon it via Banshee's extensible plugin framework.
