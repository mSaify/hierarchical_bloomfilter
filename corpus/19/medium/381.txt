Eclipse is a multi-language software development platform comprising an IDE
and a plug-in system to extend it. It is written primarily in Java and is used
to develop applications in this language and, by means of the various plug-
ins, in other languages as wellâC/C++, Cobol, Python, Perl, PHP and more.

The initial codebase originated from VisualAge.[1] In its default form it is
meant for Java developers, consisting of the Java Development Tools (JDT).
Users can extend its capabilities by installing plug-ins written for the
Eclipse software framework, such as development toolkits for other programming
languages, and can write and contribute their own plug-in modules. Language
packs provide translations into over a dozen natural languages.[2]

Released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License, Eclipse is free and
open source software.

## [edit] Architecture

Eclipse employs plug-ins in order to provide all of its functionality on top
of (and including) the runtime system, in contrast to some other applications
where functionality is typically hard coded. The runtime system of Eclipse is
based on Equinox, an OSGi standard compliant implementation.

This plug-in mechanism is a lightweight software componentry framework. In
addition to allowing Eclipse to be extended using other programming languages
such as C and Python, the plug-in framework allows Eclipse to work with
typesetting languages like LaTeX,[3] networking applications such as telnet,
and database management systems. The plug-in architecture supports writing any
desired extension to the environment, such as for configuration management.
Java and CVS support is provided in the Eclipse SDK.

The key to the seamless integration (but not of seamless interoperability) of
tools with Eclipse is the plug-in. With the exception of a small run-time
kernel, everything in Eclipse is a plugin. This means that every plugin
developed integrates with Eclipse in exactly the same way as other plugins; in
this respect, all features are created equal. Eclipse provides plugins for a
wide variety of features, some of which are through third parties using both
free and commercial models. Examples of plugins include UML plug-in for
Sequence and other UML diagrams, plug-in for Database explorer, and many
others.

The Eclipse SDK includes the Eclipse Java Development Tools, offering an IDE
with a built-in incremental Java compiler and a full model of the Java source
files. This allows for advanced refactoring techniques and code analysis. The
IDE also makes use of a workspace, in this case a set of metadata over a flat
filespace allowing external file modifications as long as the corresponding
workspace "resource" is refreshed afterwards. The Visual Editor project
(discontinued since June 30, 2006) allows interfaces to be created
interactively, thus allowing Eclipse to be used as a RAD tool.

Eclipse's widgets are implemented by a widget toolkit for Java called SWT,
unlike most Java applications, which use the Java standard Abstract Window
Toolkit (AWT) or Swing. Eclipse's user interface also uses an intermediate GUI
layer called JFace, which simplifies the construction of applications based on
SWT.

## [edit] Rich Client Platform

Eclipse provides the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) for developing general
purpose applications. The following components constitute the rich client
platform:

  * Equinox OSGi â a standard bundling framework
  * Core platform â boot Eclipse, run plug-ins
  * Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) â a portable widget toolkit
  * JFace â viewer classes to bring model view controller programming to SWT, file buffers, text handling, text editors
  * Eclipse Workbench â views, editors, perspectives, wizards

## [edit] History

Eclipse began as an IBM Canada project. It was developed by OTI (Object
Technology International) as a Java based replacement for the Smalltalk based
VisualAge family of IDE products,[4] which itself had been developed by
OTI.[1] In November 2001, a consortium was formed to further the development
of Eclipse as open source. In January 2004, the Eclipse Foundation was
created[5].

Eclipse 3.0 (released on June 21, 2004) selected the OSGi Service Platform
specifications as the runtime architecture.[6]

Eclipse was originally released under the Common Public License, but was later
relicensed under the Eclipse Public License. The Free Software Foundation has
said that both licenses are free software licenses, but are incompatible with
the GNU General Public License (GPL).[7] Mike Milinkovich, of the Eclipse
Foundation commented that moving to the GPL would be considered when version 3
of the GPL was released.[8]

According to IBM Chief Technology Officer Lee Nackman, the name "Eclipse" was
chosen to target Microsoft's Visual Studio product.[9]

## [edit] Releases

Since 2006, the Eclipse Foundation has coordinated an annual Simultaneous
Release. Each release includes the Eclipse Platform as well as a number of
other Eclipse projects. The purpose is to provide a distribution of Eclipse
software with static features and versions. Ostensibly, this simplifies
deployment and maintenance for enterprise systems, and others may simply find
it convenient. So far, each Simultaneous Release has been named after one of
the moons of Jupiter, and has occurred at the end of June.

Release Date Platform version Projects  
Callisto 30 June 2006 3.2 Callisto projects  
Europa 29 June 2007 3.3 Europa projects  
Ganymede 25 June 2008 3.4 Ganymede projects  
Galileo 26 June 2009 3.5 Galileo projects
