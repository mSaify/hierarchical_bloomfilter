MusE is a MIDI/Audio sequencer with recording and editing capabilities written
by Werner Schweer. MusE aims to be a complete multitrack virtual studio for
Linux: it currently has no support under other platforms as it relies on
Linux-only technologies, including JACK and ALSA.

From version 0.7 it has no music notation abilities as these were moved to
MuseScore. [1]

Published under the GNU General Public License, MusE is free software.
