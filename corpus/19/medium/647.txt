GNU Screen is a free terminal multiplexer developed by the GNU Project since
at least 1995.[1][dubious â discuss] It allows a user to access multiple
separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal
session. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from the command
line, and for separating programs from the shell that started the program.

## [edit] Features

GNU Screen can be thought of as a text version of graphical window managers,
or as a way of putting virtual terminals into any login session. It is a
wrapper that allows multiple text programs to run at the same time, and
provides features that allow the user to use the programs within a single
interface productively.

Persistence

    Similar to VNC, GNU Screen allows the user to start applications from one computer, and then reconnect from a different computer and continue using the same application without having to restart it. This makes migration between locations like work and home simple. Screen provides terminal-agnostic functionality so that users can disconnect and reconnect using different terminal types, allowing applications to continue running without being aware of the change in terminals.
Multiple windows

    Multiple terminal sessions can be created, each of which usually runs a single application. The windows are numbered, and the user can use the keyboard to switch between them. Some GUI terminal emulators provide tabs or otherwise similar functionality to this. Each window has its own scroll-back buffer, so that output is captured even when the window isn't actively displayed, and that history can be saved even when migrating to another computer. Windows can be split-screened. While some text applications have this functionality built in, Screen allows any application to be horizontally split-screened alongside any number of other applications.
Session Sharing

    Screen allows multiple computers to connect to the same session at once, allowing collaboration between multiple users. The same computer can also be used to make multiple simultaneous connections, providing alternative functionality to screen-splitting, particularly for computers with multiple monitors.
## [edit] Other terminal multiplexers

Other text-mode multiplexers exist with similar functionality. These include:

  * splitvt â split terminal utility
  * tmux â terminal multiplexer
  * Text windows (Twin) â a textmode windowing environment
  * Window (BSD) â window is a program on BSD Unix that implements a window environment on ASCII terminals.
  * dvtm \- a tiling terminal multiplexer which can display several applications at once
