FontForge (formerly known as PfaEdit[1]) is a typeface (font) editor program
developed by George Williams. Fontforge is free software and is distributed
under the BSD license[2]. FontForge is available for several operating systems
and is localized in several languages.

Fontforge supports several font formats like TrueType, PostScript, OpenType,
CID-keyed, multi-master, CFF, SVG, BDF, Datafork TrueType, etc. Fontforge can
convert fonts from one format to another. FontForge can also store fonts in
its native format called âspline font database filesâ using the `.sfd`
extension, which has the advantage that is text-based[3]. This format
facilitates designer collaboration because it allows diffs to be easily
created and reviewed; the two users usually need to use the same Fontforge
version, otherwise the .sfd text representation can differ too much to be
useful for diff reviewing.

To facilitate automated format conversions and other transformations,
Fontforge implements two scripting languages: its own legacy language, and
more recently Python[4]. Support for one or both scripting languages can be
selected at compile time. FontForge can be built as a python module to be
loaded from python scripts[5]

Fontforge supports Adobe's OpenType feature file specification (with its own
extensions to the syntax)[6]. It also supports the unofficial Microsoft
mathematical typesetting extensions (`MATH` table)[7] introduced for Cambria
Math and supported by Office 2007 and XeTeX. At least one free OpenType
mathematical font has been developed in FontForge (see below).

FontForge uses FreeType for rendering fonts on screen[8]. Since 15-Nov-2008
release, FontForge can use libcairo and libpango for graphics and text
rendering[9] providing anti-alaised graphics and complex text layout support.

FontForge can use Potrace to import bitmap image into a font.
