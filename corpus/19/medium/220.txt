### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

A web content management system (WCMS or Web CMS) is content management system
(CMS) software, usually implemented as a Web application, for creating and
managing HTML content. It is used to manage and control a large, dynamic
collection of Web material (HTML documents and their associated images). A
WCMS facilitates content creation, content control, editing, and many
essential Web maintenance functions.

Usually the software provides authoring (and other) tools designed to allow
users with little or no knowledge of programming languages or markup languages
to create and manage content with relative ease of use.

Most systems use a database to store content, metadata, and/or artifacts that
might be needed by the system. Content is frequently, but not universally,
stored as XML, to facilitate reuse and enable flexible presentation
options.[1][2]

A presentation layer displays the content to regular Web-site visitors based
on a set of templates. The templates are sometimes XSLT files.[3]

Administration is typically done through browser-based interfaces, but some
systems require the use of a fat client.

Unlike Web-site builders like Microsoft FrontPage or Adobe Dreamweaver, a WCMS
allows non-technical users to make changes to an existing website with little
or no training. A WCMS typically requires an experienced coder to set up and
add features, but is primarily a Web-site maintenance tool for non-technical
administrators.

## [edit] Capabilities

A WCMS is a software system used to manage and control a large, dynamic
collection of Web material (HTML documents and their associated images). A CMS
facilitates document control, auditing, editing, and timeline management. A
WCMS provides the following key features:

Automated templates

    Create standard output templates (usually HTML and XML) that can be automatically applied to new and existing content, allowing the appearance of all content to be changed from one central place.
Easily editable content

    Once content is separated from the visual presentation of a site, it usually becomes much easier and quicker to edit and manipulate. Most WCMS software includes WYSIWYG editing tools allowing non-technical individuals to create and edit content.
Scalable feature sets

    Most WCMS software includes plug-ins or modules that can be easily installed to extend an existing site's functionality.
Web standards upgrades

    Active WCMS software usually receives regular updates that include new feature sets and keep the system up to current web standards.
Workflow management

    Workflow is the process of creating cycles of sequential and parallel tasks that must be accomplished in the CMS. For example, a content creator can submit a story, but it is not published until the copy editor cleans it up and the editor-in-chief approves it.
Delegation

    Some CMS software allows for various user groups to have limited privileges over specific content on the website, spreading out the responsibility of content management.[4]
Document management

    CMS software may provide a means of managing the life cycle of a document from initial creation time, through revisions, publication, archive, and document destruction.
Content virtualization

    CMS software may provide a means of allowing each user to work within a virtual copy of the entire Web site, document set, and/or code base. This enables changes to multiple interdependent resources to be viewed and/or executed in-context prior to submission.
## [edit] Types

There are three major types of WCMS: offline processing, online processing,
and hybrid systems. These terms describe the deployment pattern for the WCMS
in terms of when presentation templates are applied to render Web pages from
structured content. Seth Gottlieb has used the terms 'baking', 'frying', and
'parbaking' to describe the three alternatives.[5]

### [edit] Offline processing

These systems pre-process all content, applying templates before publication
to generate Web pages. Vignette CMS and Bricolage are examples of this type of
system. Since pre-processing systems do not require a server to apply the
templates at request time, they may also exist purely as design-time tools;
Adobe Contribute is an example of this approach.

### [edit] Online processing

These systems apply templates on-demand. HTML may be generated when a user
visits the page, or pulled from a cache. Hosted CMSs are provided by such SaaS
developers as AspireCMS, Bravenet, UcoZ, Freewebs and Crownpeak.

Some of the better known open source systems that produce pages on demand
include Concrete5, Mambo, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, Zikula and Plone, etc...

DotNetNuke is a partially open source CMS that runs on asp.net and is free to
download and install. DNN produces pages on demand but levels and types of
caching can be set. There are also many additional "modules" that can be
purchased or installed for free to extend the functionality of DNN as needed,
many of which create data and content dynamically.

Most Web application frameworks perform template processing in this way, but
they do not necessarily incorporate content management features. Wikis, e.g.
MediaWiki and TWiki generally follow an online model (with varying degrees of
caching), but generally do not provide document workflow.

### [edit] Hybrid Systems

Some systems combine the offline and online approaches. Some systems write out
executable code (e.g. JSP, ASP, PHP,ColdFusion,Perl pages) rather than just
static HTML, so that the CMS itself does not need to be deployed on every Web
server. Other hybrids, such as Blosxom, are capable of operating in either an
online or offline mode.[6]

  

## [edit] Web Content Management History

Web Content Management Systems began to be formally developed as a commercial
software products in the mid nineties. In the mid 2000s, the web content
management market became a fragmented market as a plethora of new providers
emerged to complement the traditional vendors. These Web Content Management
systems are typically broken down into several groups:  
Software as a Service: AspireCMS, Clickability, Knivis, Crownpeak, Hot Banana
and others  
Enterprise: Sitecore, FatWire, Vignette, Interwoven, Documentum, MySource
Matrix (Squiz), Alfresco, Oracle, IBM Web Content Management, SDL Tridion and
others  
Mid-market: Microsoft SharePoint, Kentico, Goss Interactive, Contrexx, Ektron,
PaperThin, Ingeniux, Terapad, Cascade Server,Logical CMS and others  
Open source: Magnolia, Plone, Joomla, Drupal, Alfresco, Sensenet 6.0, MiaCMS,
MMBase, TYPO3, MySource Matrix (Squiz), WordPress
