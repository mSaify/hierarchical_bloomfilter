Lemur Control Surface

The Lemur Input Device is a highly-customizable multi-touch device from French
company JazzMutant which serves as a controller for musical devices such as
synthesizers and mixing consoles as well as for other media applications such
as video performances. As an audio tool, the Lemur's role is equivalent to
that of a MIDI controller in a MIDI studio setup, except that the Lemur uses
the Open Sound Control protocol, a proposed high-speed networking replacement
for MIDI. The controller is especially well-suited for use with Reaktor and
Max/MSP, tools for building custom software synthesizers.

## [edit] Creating an interface

The Lemur comes with its own proprietary software called the JazzEditor to
create interfaces. Users can build interfaces using a selection of 15
different objects (including fader, knobs, pads, sliders...), group them as
modules and arrange them using as many pages as needed. Each object can then
receive any MIDI or OSC attribute. A particularity of the Lemur is the ability
to modify the physical behavior of each object (for instance adding or
removing friction on faders). The internal memory of the Lemur enables to
store many interfaces, each one controlling a specific software for instance.
