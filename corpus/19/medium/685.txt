usage. It is also an Application wiki which allows the creation of
applications (including structured data and scripting) within the Wiki
interface. The languages that can be used are Velocity and Groovy.

## [edit] History

XWiki was originally written by Ludovic Dubost and was first released in
January 2003. The first version of the Wiki Farm XWiki.com was released in
April 2003. It was first released under the GNU General Public License. It was
announced in February 2006 that the license will be changed to the GNU Lesser
General Public License. By the end of 2006 the release of the first Beta
version along with the arrival of Vincent Massol at the head of XWiki
development team were announced. Since then the development continues, the
current stable version of XWiki is the 1.8 [1].

## [edit] Features

XWiki is an advanced wiki software which includes a number of professional
features

  * Structured content and inline scripting, which allows to build wiki applications
  * User rights management (by wiki / space / page, using groups, etc...)
  * PDF export
  * Full-text search
  * Version control
  * Import office documents into wiki syntax through OpenOffice
  * Various protocols for accessing the wiki (WebDAV, REST, XmlRpc, GWT)
  * Content and site design Export and Import
  * Plugins, API, Programming...
  * More features on the official website. [2]

On top of this, XWiki is also an application wiki that allows the creation of
objects and classes within the wiki. This way, forms can be developed in a
very short time span and be reused to enter data on the wiki following a
specific template. This means that end users can be presented with a page on
which the layout is already drawn, where they can directly fill in the fields
needed.

## [edit] Open-Source projects

XWiki relies heavily on other Open-Source projects to work. They include:

  * Hibernate: relational database storage
  * Lucene: to index all the content of a wiki and its attachments and allow the search within their content.
  * Velocity: a powerful template language
  * Groovy: for advanced scripting requirements
  * Radeox: the wiki rendering engine, it converts the wiki syntax into XHTML.
