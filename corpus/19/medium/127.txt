QTFairUse is a software application first released in November 2003 by Jon
Lech Johansen. It dumps the raw output of a QuickTime AAC stream to a file,
which could bypass the digital rights management (DRM) algorithm called
FairPlay used to encrypt music content of media files such as those
distributed by the iTunes Store, Apple's online music store. Although these
resulting raw AAC files were unplayable by most media players at the time of
release, they represented the first attempt at circumventing Apple's
encryption. These early versions of QTFairUse would save only the "raw" AAC
(not contained in an MPEG-4 (MP4) container), but later incarnations properly
supported full conversions.

Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, QTFairUse is free
software.

## [edit] Technical approach

Functionally, the purpose of QTFairUse is to convert protected audio files
(.m4p extension) purchased from Apple's iTunes Store into M4a files, without
DRM. To accomplish this task it uses a rather uncommon approach: instead of
removing the already present DRM, it waits for iTunes to play back the
protected file and intercepts the unencrypted AAC data stream as it is sent to
the sound card. During this process, it copies unencrypted data, frame-by-
frame, into RAM and then inserts it into a new MP4 container that is free of
any DRM.

## [edit] iTunes versions

The current release (as of December 13, 2007) of QTFairUse6, version 6-2.5,
supports iTunes 6.0.2 through 7.0.2. An updated config file compatible with
iTunes 7.1.2 was released on May 14 2007\. An iTunes 7.3.1 compatible
configuration file was released on June 12, the same day Apple released the
new iTunes update. An iTunes 7.4.2.4 compatible configuration file was
released on September 18 2007.[1] This config file is also compatible with
iTunes 7.5.0.20. The config file needs to be updated with each new iTunes
release; so far the author has released updates the same day as the new iTunes
release. As of January 15, 2008, the programs author has not updated QTFairUse
for the latest version of iTunes, and the current revision is not compatible
with that version.

## [edit] Cease and Desist

As of February 20, 2008, the QTFairUse project was given a cease and desist
letter by Apple, Inc. All files were subsequently removed from the main
download site.
