Cooperative Linux, abbreviated as coLinux, is software which allows Microsoft
Windows and the Linux kernel to run simultaneously in parallel on the same
machine.[1]

Cooperative Linux utilizes the concept of a Cooperative Virtual Machine (CVM).
In contrast to traditional VMs, the CVM shares resources that already exist in
the host OS. In traditional (host) VMs, resources are virtualized for every
(guest) OS. The CVM gives both OSs complete control of the host machine while
the traditional VM sets every guest OS in an unprivileged state to access the
real machine.

## [edit] Overview

The term "cooperative" is used to describe two entities working in parallel.
In effect Cooperative Linux turns the two different operating system kernels
into two big coroutines. Each kernel has its own complete CPU context and
address space, and each kernel decides when to give control back to its
partner.

However, while both kernels theoretically have full access to the real
hardware, modern PC hardware is not designed to be controlled by two different
operating systems at the same time. Therefore the host kernel is left in
control of the real hardware and the guest kernel contains special drivers
that communicate with the host and provide various important devices to the
guest OS. The host can be any OS kernel that exports basic primitives that
allow the Cooperative Linux portable driver to run in CPL0 mode (ring 0) and
allocate memory.

## [edit] History

Dan Aloni originally started the development of Cooperative Linux based on
similar work with User-mode Linux. He announced the development on 25 Jan
2004.[2] In July 2004 he presented a paper at the Linux Symposium.[3] The
source was released under the GNU General Public License. Other developers
have since contributed various patches and additions to the software.

## [edit] Comparisons

Cooperative Linux is significantly different from full x86 virtualization,
which generally work by running the guest OS in a less privileged mode than
that of the host kernel, and having all resources delegated by the host
kernel. In contrast, Cooperative Linux runs a specially modified Linux kernel
that is Cooperative as in it takes responsibility for not instigating race
conditions, and sharing resources with the NT kernel.

## [edit] Distribution

Most of the changes in the Cooperative Linux patch are on the i386 treeâthe
only supported architecture for Cooperative at the time of this writing. The
other changes are mostly additions of virtual drivers: cobd (block device),
conet (network), and cocon (console). Most of the changes in the i386 tree
involve the initialization and setup code. It is a goal of the Cooperative
Linux kernel design to remain as close as possible to the standalone i386
kernel, so all changes are localized and minimized as much as possible.

The coLinux package installs a port of the Linux kernel and a virtual network
device and can run simultaneously under a version of the Windows operating
system such as Windows 2000 or Windows XP. It does not use a virtual machine
such as VMware.

Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Gentoo are especially popular with the coLinux
users.

Due to the rather unusual structure of the virtual hardware, installing Linux
distributions under coLinux is generally difficult. Therefore users generally
use either an existing Linux install on a real partition or ready made
filesystem image distributed by the project. The filesystem images are made by
a variety of methods, including taking images of a normal Linux system,
finding ways to make installers run with the strange hardware, building
installs up using the package manager by hand or simply upgrading existing
images using tools like yum and apt. An easier way to get an up-to-date
filesystem image is to use QEMU to install Linux and "convert" the image by
stripping off the first 63 512-byte blocks as described in the coLinux wiki.

Since coLinux does not have access to native graphics hardware, X Window or X
Servers will not run under coLinux directly, but you can install an X Server
under Windows, such as Cygwin/X or Xming and use KDE or GNOME and almost any
other Linux application and distribution.[4]
