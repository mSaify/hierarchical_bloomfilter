In computing, a shell is a piece of software that provides an interface for
users. Typically, the term refers to an operating system shell which provides
access to the services of a kernel. However, the term is also applied very
loosely to applications and may include any software that is "built around" a
particular component, such as web browsers and email clients that are "shells"
for HTML rendering engines. The name 'shell' originates from shells being an
outer layer of interface between the user and the innards of the operating
system (the kernel).

Operating system shells generally fall into one of two categories: command-
line and graphical. Command-line shells provide a command-line interface (CLI)
to the operating system, while graphical shells provide a graphical user
interface (GUI). In either category the primary purpose of the shell is to
invoke or "launch" another program; however, shells frequently have additional
capabilities such as viewing the contents of directories.

The relative merits of CLI- and GUI-based shells are often debated. CLI
proponents claim that certain operations can be performed much faster under
CLI shells than under GUI shells (such as moving files, for example). However,
GUI proponents advocate the comparative usability and simplicity of GUI
shells. The best choice is often determined by the way in which a computer
will be used. On a server mainly used for data transfers and processing with
expert administration, a CLI is likely to be the best choice. On the other
hand, a GUI would be more appropriate for a computer to be used for image or
video editing and the development of the above data.

  * BASIC-PLUS â RSTS/E
  * Beemos (BEEMos) â A small project that provides settings, appliations, and feels like a separate OS that runs over Windows XP.
  * CANDE MCSâ command line shell and text editor on the MCP operating system
  * CCP â console command processor of CP/M
  * cmd.exe â shell for OS/2, Windows CE and Windows NT-based operating systems
  * COMMAND.COM â shell for DOS
  * Commodore DOS Wedge â an extension to the Commodore 64's BASIC 2.0 that included shorthand for common disk operations
  * DCL â the standard shell for OpenVMS, deriving from versions created for earlier DEC operating systems

  * Windows PowerShell â the object-oriented successor of cmd.exe (formerly known as Monad or the Microsoft Shell (MSH))
  * Windows Recovery Console â feature of the Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows 2003 operating systems
  * YouShell \- JavaScript based command processor of YouOS

### [edit] Shells for programming languages

Noteworthy interactive versions of programming languages include:

  * The Read-eval-print loop commonly associated with Lisp, but used in other programming languages as well
  * BeanShell â Shell for Java
  * Firebug â JavaScript shell and debugging environment as Firefox plugin
  * GMLCMD â GML Shell
  * Interactive Ruby Shell â interactive version of Ruby
  * JavaScript shell â Several programs by this name allow interactive JavaScript
  * PHPsh â Shell for PHP
  * Python's standard interpreter can be invoked in a shell mode

## [edit] Graphical (GUI) shells

### [edit] On Microsoft Windows

Main articles: Windows Shell and Windows shell replacement

Modern versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system use Windows Shell as
their shell. Explorer provides the familiar desktop environment, start menu,
and task bar, as well as the file management functions of the operating
system. Older versions also include Program Manager which was the shell for
the 3.x series of Microsoft Windows.

Many individuals and developers dissatisfied with the interface of Windows
Explorer have developed software that either alters the functioning and
appearance of the shell or replaces it entirely. WindowBlinds by StarDock is a
good example of the former sort of application. LiteStep, GeoShell and BB4Win
are good examples of the latter.

### [edit] On the X Window System

Graphical (GUI) shells typically build on top of a windowing system. In case
of the X Window System, there are both independent X window managers, and
complete desktop environments which depend on a window manager.

X Window System environments (primarily for Unix-like operating systems):

  * independent X window managers, such as Blackbox and Fluxbox
  * desktop shells, such as Enlightenment DR17
  * full desktop environments, such as: 
    * CDE
    * GNOME
    * KDE
    * Xfce

### [edit] On other platforms

  * Amiga environments: 
    * Ambient (for MorphOS)
    * Directory Opus
    * ScalOS
    * Wanderer (for AROS.)
    * Workbench (GUI-Shell capabilities added since Kickstart 2.0)

  * DOS Shell
  * Finder (software) (for Mac OS X)
  * MirageOS (for TI-83 and TI-84 series graphing calculators)
