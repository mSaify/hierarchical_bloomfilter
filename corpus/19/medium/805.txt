Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java Platform as an
alternative to the Java programming language. It is a dynamic language with
features similar to those of Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk. It can be used
as a scripting language for the Java Platform.

Groovy uses a Java-like curly bracket syntax which is dynamically compiled to
Java Virtual Machine bytecode and which works seamlessly with other Java code
and libraries. The Groovy compiler can be used to generate standard Java
bytecode to be used by any Java project. Most Java code is also syntactically
valid Groovy.

Groovy is currently undergoing standardization via the Java Community Process
under JSR 241. Groovy 1.0 was released on January 2, 2007.

## [edit] Features

<IMG> This section requires expansion.  
The Groovy language is largely a superset of the Java language. One can
usually rename a .java file to a .groovy one and it will work (though there
are a few incompatibilities). Groovy has a number of features not found in
standard Java. This makes the learning curve for Java developers almost zero,
since they can start with Java syntax and gradually learn to add Groovy
features. [1] Groovy features not available in Java include both static and
dynamic typing (with the def keyword), closures, operator overloading, native
syntax for lists and associative arrays (maps), native support for regular
expressions, polymorphic iteration, expressions embedded inside strings,
additional helper methods, and the safe navigation operator "?." to
automatically check for nulls (for example, "variable?.method()", or
"variable?.field"). [2]

Groovy's syntax can be made far more compact than Java. For example, a
declaration in Standard Java 5+ such as:

    
    public class StdJava
    {
      public static void main(String argv[])
      {
        for (String it : new String [] {"Rod", "Carlos", "Chris"})
          if (it.length() <= 4)
            System.out.println(it);
      }
    }
    
can be expressed in Groovy as:

    
     ["Rod", "Carlos", "Chris"].findAll{it.size() <= 4}.each{println it}
    
One noteworthy feature of Groovy is its native support for various markup
languages such as XML and HTML, accomplished via an inline DOM syntax. This
feature enables the definition and manipulation of many types of heterogeneous
data assets with a uniform and concise syntax and programming
methodology.[citation needed]

## [edit] History

James Strachan first talked about the development of Groovy in his blog in
August 2003. Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. After the
JCP standardization process began, the version numbering was changed and a
version called "1.0" was released on Tuesday, January 2, 2007. After various
betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007 Groovy 1.1
Final was released and immediately rebranded as Groovy 1.5 as a reflection of
the great improvement made.

## [edit] IDE support

Many integrated development environments support Groovy:

  * Eclipse, through a plugin
  * IntelliJ IDEA, through the Jet Groovy Plugin
  * NetBeans, since version 6.5
