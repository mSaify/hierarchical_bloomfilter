## [edit] Features and common use

While suitable for any application which requires full text indexing and
searching capability, Lucene has been widely recognized for its utility in the
implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching.

At the core of Lucene's logical architecture is the idea of a document
containing fields of text. This flexibility allows Lucene's API to be
independent of the file format. Text from PDFs, HTML, Microsoft Word, and
OpenDocument documents, as well as many others can all be indexed so long as
their textual information can be extracted.

## [edit] Lucene-based projects

Lucene itself is just an indexing and search library and does not contain
crawling and HTML parsing functionality. The Apache project Nutch is based on
Lucene and provides this functionality; the Apache project Solr is a fully-
featured search server based on Lucene; Compass is a Java Search Engine
Framework built on the top of Lucene.
