Cinelerra is non-linear video editing system. It is designed for the GNU/Linux
operating system, but has also been successfully ported to Mac OS X. No
support is provided for any version of Microsoft Windows. It is produced by
Heroine Virtual, and is free software distributed under the GNU General Public
License. Cinelerra also includes a video compositing engine, allowing the user
to perform common compositing operations such as keying and mattes.

Cinelerra was first released August 1, 2002, and was based in part on an
earlier product known as Broadcast 2000. Broadcast 2000 was withdrawn by
Heroine Virtual in September 2001[1].

As a professional editing program, Cinelerra requires significant computing
power.

## [edit] Notable features

Cinelerra includes support for very high-fidelity audio and video: it
processes audio using 64 bits of precision, and can work in both RGBA and YUVA
color spaces, using floating-point and 16-bit integer representations,
respectively. It is resolution and frame rate-independent, meaning that it can
support video of any speed and size.

Other features may be found on its features list.

## [edit] Cinelerra interface

Cinelerra 2.1 being used to edit footage in a video project.

Cinelerra's interface is similar to that of other nonlinear video-editing
systems, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. However, because it includes a
compositing engine, it may also be likened to compositing software such as
Adobe After Effects or Shake. The user is presented with four screens:

  1. The timeline, which gives the user a time-based view of all video and audio tracks in the project, as well as keyframe data for e.g. camera movement, effects, or opacity;
  2. the viewer, which gives the user a method of "scrubbing" through footage;
  3. the resource window, which presents the user with a view of all audio and video resources in the project, as well as available audio and video effects and transitions; and
  4. the compositor, which presents the user with a view of the final project as it would look when rendered. The compositor is interactive in that it allows the user to adjust the positions of video objects; it also updates in response to user input.

Cinelerra's interface is frequently criticized because it does not conform to
either GNOME or KDE Human interface guidelines.[citation needed]

## [edit] Cinelerra usage and awards

Cinelerra has gained ground among some GNU/Linux enthusiasts looking for a
native video editing system. Professional use is mostly promoted by Linux
Media Arts, which sells an integrated hardware and software package for video
production that includes Cinelerra.

At the National Association of Broadcasters' 2004 Electronic Media Show,
Cinelerra was awarded Bob Turner's "MAKING THE CUT" award. The award is given
to "the best and most exciting postproduction products seen at the convention"
[2].

## [edit] The Community Version

Heroine Virtual generates a new release of Cinelerra semi-annually, available
as source code only. Any bugs and usability issues found and resolved by the
community that are submitted to Heroine Virtual often result in no immediate
response, and it is not until a new release that there is any indication that
Heroine Virtual has incorporated these changes. Because of both the latency in
development and the distribution-specific nature of the release, a group of
free and open-source software developers created their own version of
Cinelerra referred to as Cinelerra-CV (where CV stands for Community Version).

Cinelerra-CV allows the community to contribute to an open repository where
changes to the code are accessible to everyone. Mailing lists and an IRC
channel exist where more experienced users and developers can provide support
to less experienced users, and developers can hold technical discussions.
Cinelerra-CV is also packaged for a wider range of distributions. It also has
a different compilation system: system libraries are used extensively, and the
autoconf/automake tools are used to configure the compilation system.

Although Cinelerra-CV may technically be called a fork, the relationship
between Heroine Virtual and Cinelerra-CV is rather friendly. Heroine Virtual
at times contributes to discussions on the mailing lists, and incorporates
many of the changes made in the repository. Heroine Virtual posted the
following message on their website describing the relationship:

> What you'll find here is the heroinewarrior version of Cinelerra. This is
the version that supports what we need to do at Heroine Virtual Ltd. and is
the same tree that was started in 1997. As time passes and new students come
and go from the Linux scene, new forks of Cinelerra emerge that are more
suited to the community but not what Heroine Virtual Ltd. needs. Today you'll
probably find the cinelerra.org fork more useful.

> They allow certain parts of our fork into their fork while contributing
anything they want while we allow certain parts of their fork into our fork
while contributing anything we want".[1]

The versioning of Cinelerra-CV follows that of Heroine Virtual. After Heroine
Virtual produces a release, Cinelerra-CV examines the changes introduced by
the new version and merges them into their version. CV is appended to the end
of the version number to indicate the community version. (For example, after
the 2.1 merger the CV version is labeled 2.1CV.)

### [edit] Lumiera rewrite

In the beginning of April 2008, the Cinelerra community announced a complete
rewrite of the current community version, named as Lumiera. It was born as a
rewrite of the Cinelerra codebase called Cinelerra3 but soon was separated
into an independent project with its own name. Lumiera is still in an early
stage of development. It is not usable yet.[2]
