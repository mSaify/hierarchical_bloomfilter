MacPorts, formerly called DarwinPorts,[1] is a free/open source software
project to simplify installation of other free/open source software on the Mac
OS X and Darwin operating systems. Similar in aim and function to Fink and the
BSDs' ports collections, DarwinPorts was started in 2002 as part of the
OpenDarwin project, with the involvement of a number of Apple Inc. employees
including Landon Fuller, Kevin Van Vechten, and Jordan Hubbard.

It allows the installation of a number of packages by simply entering the
command `port install packagename` in the Terminal, which will then download,
compile and install the requested software, while also installing any required
dependencies automatically. Similar to APT in Debian.

On April 28, 2005, the project released version 1.0 of their software.[2] In
December 2005, the project reached a milestone, passing 3000 ports.[3] As of
January 2009, MacPorts version 1.7.0 contains more than 5000 ports.

MacPorts are hosted on Mac OS Forge, which was created and maintained by Apple
Inc..
