Darwin is an open source POSIX-compliant computer operating system released by
Apple Inc. in 2000. It is composed of code developed by Apple, as well as code
derived from NEXTSTEP, FreeBSD, and other free software projects.

Darwin forms the core set of components upon which Mac OS X and iPhone OS are
based. It is compatible with the Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3)
and POSIX UNIX applications and utilities.[citation needed]

## [edit] History

Darwin's heritage began with NeXT's NEXTSTEP operating system (later known as
OPENSTEP), first released in 1989. After Apple bought NeXT in 1997, it
announced it would base its next operating system on OPENSTEP. This was
developed into Rhapsody in 1997 and the Rhapsody-based Mac OS X Server 1.0 in
1999. In 2000, Rhapsody was forked into Darwin and released as open-source
software under the Apple Public Source License (APSL), and components from
Darwin are present in Mac OS X today.

Up to Darwin 8.0, Apple released a binary installer (as an ISO image) after
each major Mac OS X release that allowed one to install Darwin on PowerPC and
Intel x86 computers as a standalone operating system. Minor updates were
released as packages that were installed separately. Darwin is now only
available as source code,[1] except for the ARM variant, which has not been
released in any form separately from iPhone OS. However, the older versions of
Darwin are still available in Binary form.

## [edit] Design

### [edit] Kernel

Darwin is built around XNU, a hybrid kernel that combines the Mach 3
microkernel, various elements of BSD (including the process model, network
stack, and virtual file system),[2] and an object-oriented device driver API
called I/O Kit.[3]

Some of the benefits of this choice of kernel are the Mach-O binary format,
which allows a single executable file (including the kernel itself) to support
multiple CPU architectures, and the mature support for symmetric
multiprocessing in Mach. The hybrid kernel design compromises between the
flexibility of a microkernel and the performance of a monolithic kernel.

### [edit] Hardware and software support

Darwin currently includes support for both 32-bit and 64-bit variants of the
PowerPC and Intel x86 processors used in the Mac and Apple TV as well as the
32-bit ARM processor used in the iPhone and iPod Touch. An open-source port of
the XNU kernel exists which supports Darwin on Intel and AMD x86 platforms not
officially supported by Apple.[4]

It supports the POSIX API by way of its BSD lineage and a large number of
programs written for various other UNIX-like systems can be compiled on Darwin
with no changes to the source code[citation needed].

Darwin and Mac OS X both use I/O Kit for their drivers and therefore support
the same hardware, file systems, and so forth. Apple's distribution of Darwin
included proprietary (binary-only) drivers for their AirPort wireless cards.

Darwin does not include many of the defining elements of Mac OS X, such as the
Carbon and Cocoa APIs or the Quartz Compositor and Aqua user interface, and
thus cannot run Mac applications. It does, however, support a number of lesser
known features of Mac OS X, such as mDNSResponder, which is the multicast DNS
responder and a core component of the Bonjour networking technology, and
launchd, an advanced service management framework.

## [edit] License

In July 2003, Apple released Darwin under version 2.0 of the Apple Public
Source License (APSL), which the Free Software Foundation (FSF) approved as a
free software license. Previous releases had taken place under an earlier
version of the APSL that did not meet the FSF's definition of free software,
although it met the requirements of the Open Source Definition.

## [edit] Mascot

The Darwin developers decided to adopt a mascot in 2000, and chose Hexley the
Platypus, over other contenders, such as an Aqua Darwin fish, Clarus the
Dogcow, and an orca. Hexley is a cartoon platypus who usually wears a cap
resembling a demon's horns. He carries a trident, similar to the BSD Daemon,
to symbolize the daemon's forking of processes. Hexley was designed and
copyrighted by Jon Hooper; Apple does not sanction Hexley as a logo for
Darwin.[5]

The name was a mistake: it was originally supposed to be named after Thomas
Henry Huxley, a 19th century English biologist who was a well-known champion
of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution (nick-named "Darwin's bulldog");
however, ignorance led not only to a mistake in Huxley's name but who he was
(the developers apparently thought he was simply Darwin's assistant, when in
fact he was a prominent biologist in his own right). By the time the mistake
had been discovered, however, it was deemed too late to change and the
incorrect name "Hexley" was kept.[6]

## [edit] Releases

This is a table of major Darwin releases with their dates of release and their
corresponding Mac OS X releases.[7] Note that the corresponding Mac OS X
release may have been released on a different date; refer to the Mac OS X
pages for those dates.

Version number Release date Corresponding releases Features and changes  
0.1 March 16, 1999 Mac OS X Server 1.0  
1.0 April 5, 2000 Mac OS X DP4 (Darwin 1.0.2)

and PHP 4 updated to Apache 2.2 and PHP 5, read-only ZFS support.[12]  
The jump in version numbers from Darwin 1.4.1 to 5.1 with the release of Mac
OS X v10.1.1 was designed to tie Darwin to the Mac OS X version and build
numbering system. In the build numbering system of Mac OS X, every version has
a unique beginning build number, which identifies what whole version of Mac OS
X it is part of. Mac OS X v10.0 had build numbers starting with 4, 10.1 had
build numbers starting with 5, and so forth (earlier build numbers represented
developer releases). The point release number in the Darwin version is always
the same as the second point number in the Mac OS X version. In the case of
Mac OS X v10.1.1 (the version where the jump in version numbers was made),
this was build 5M28 and the 10.1.1 release, from which a version number of 5.1
was derived.[13]

The command `uname -r` in Terminal will show the Darwin version number, and
the command `uname -v` will show the XNU build version string, which includes
the Darwin version number.

## [edit] Derived projects

Due to the free software nature of Darwin, there are many projects that aim to
modify or enhance the operating system.

### [edit] OpenDarwin

GNOME running on OpenDarwin.

OpenDarwin was a community-led operating system based on the Darwin system. It
was founded in April 2002 by Apple Inc. and Internet Systems Consortium. Its
goal was to increase collaboration between Apple developers and the free
software community. Apple theoretically benefited from the project because
improvements to OpenDarwin would be incorporated into Darwin releases; and the
free/open source community supposedly benefited from being given complete
control over its own operating system, which could then be used in free
software distributions such as GNU-Darwin.[14]

On July 25, 2006, the OpenDarwin team announced that the project was shutting
down, as they felt OpenDarwin had "become a mere hosting facility for Mac OS X
related projects," and that the efforts to create a standalone Darwin
operating system had failed. They also state: "Availability of sources,
interaction with Apple representatives, difficulty building and tracking
sources, and a lack of interest from the community have all contributed to
this."[15] The last stable release was version 7.2.1, released on July 16,
2004.[16]

### [edit] PureDarwin

In 2007, the PureDarwin project was launched to continue where OpenDarwin left
off, and is currently working to produce a release based on Darwin 9. There is
a developer preview available, called "PureDarwin XMas", based on Darwin 9.
This release has X11, DTrace, and ZFS[17]. PureDarwin nano is a another
release of PureDarwin that is supposed to be minimalistic.

### [edit] Other

  * MacPorts (formerly DarwinPorts) and Fink are both well known projects to port UNIX programs to the Darwin operating system and provide package management. In addition, several standard UNIX package managersâsuch as RPM, pkgsrc, and Portageâhave Darwin ports. Some of these operate in their own namespace so as not to interfere with the base system.
  * GNU-Darwin is a project that ports packages of free software to Darwin.
  * The Darwine project is a port of Wine that allows one to run Microsoft Windows software on Darwin.[18]
  * SEDarwin is a port of TrustedBSD mandatory access control framework and portions of the SELinux framework to Darwin.[19]
  * The Darbat project is an experimental port of Darwin to the L4 microkernel family. It aims to be binary compatible with existing Darwin binaries.[20]
  * There are various projects that focus on driver support: e.g., wireless drivers,[21][22] wired NIC drivers[23],[24][25] modem drivers,[26] card readers,[27] and the ext2 and ext3 file systems.[28]
