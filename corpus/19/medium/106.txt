CINEMA 4D is a commercial, cross-platform, high-end 3-D graphics application,
produced by MAXON Computer GmbH of Friedrichsdorf, Germany. Noted for its
flexible interface and ease of use, it is capable of procedural and
polygonal/subd modelling, animating, lighting, texturing and rendering.

## [edit] Overview

CINEMA 4D is a 3-D application that is popular amongst matte painters in film
production, largely due to the BodyPaint 3D functionality. It is equally
popular amongst motion graphics artists, thanks to its excellent integration
with compositing application pipelines, and a very artist-friendly,
customizable workflow and interface. It has been used for films such as We Are
the Strange[1], Polar Express[2], Open Season[3] and Monster House[4].

The application relies on widely used computer 3-D technology, which works by
creating groups of "points" (known as vertices) which form surfaces when
connected. The illusion of three dimensions is created by modeling objects out
of multiple surfaces. Still pictures, movies and game environments (among
other things) can be created with this technique.

CINEMA 4D has its own runtime scripting and programming language C.O.F.F.E.E.
which is rather similar in form to JScript and an advanced modern C++ API,
with an extensive SDK for developing platform-independent plug-ins.

Beginning with Release 11, Cinema4D for Mac has been written in Cocoa, which
ensures maximum performance by using the 64-bit architecture of modern Intel-
powered Macs. For non-Intel-based Macs, a 32-bit mode is available.[5]

Four different packages have been released by MAXON: the core CINEMA 4D
application, the XL-Bundle (including NET Render [3 licenses], PyroCluster,
Advanced Render, MOCCA and Thinking Particles), the Studio Bundle, which
includes all modules, and the Production Bundle, available only upon request,
which comes with a service contract, Linux version, Renderman support and a
number of other high-end studio-specific features.

Initially, CINEMA 4D was developed for Amiga computers in the early nineties,
but has since been released for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

MAXON has created a way for all users to be able to 'get into' 3D with their
software by pursuing this route. For R10 there is, in addition to the
installation DVD, a training DVD containing more than 6GB of video tutorials
in either German or English. MAXON bundles HTML manuals and tutorials/videos
with its software. New in release 10 are context-sensitive help menus.

CINEMA 4D has been embraced by the Adobe After Effects community because of
C4D's external compositing tags and object IDs, which make exporting 3-D data
efficient and simple. Separate alpha and depth information may also be
exported. Because the export feature also supports Apple's Final Cut Pro and
other popular software, it fits well into several post-production studio
configurations.

## [edit] Modules

As well as the core application (for modelling, texturing, lighting and
rendering), CINEMA 4D also has several available add-on programs (modules)
that expand its capabilities. These programs include:

  * Advanced Render (global illumination/HDRI, caustics, ambient occlusion and sky simulation)
  * BodyPaint 3D (direct painting on UVW meshes) 
    * With CINEMA 4D R10 the module BodyPaint 3D became integrated in the basic package
  * Dynamics (for simulating soft body and rigid body dynamics)
  * HAIR (simulates hair, fur, grass, etc.)
  * MOCCA (character animation and cloth simulation)
  * MoGraph (Motion Graphics procedural modelling and animation toolset)
  * NET Render (to render animations over a TCP/IP network in render farms)
  * PyroCluster (simulation of smoke and fire effects) 
    * With CINEMA 4D R10, the module PyroCluster became integrated in the Advanced Render module
  * Sketch & Toon (tools for cel shading, cartoons and technical drawings)
  * Thinking Particles (enhanced particle system based on nodes)

## [edit] Additional rendering engines

As-of 2007, these alternative rendering engines and connections are currently
available as plug-ins for CINEMA 4D:

  * finalRender stage 2.0 SP4 from Cebas Computer GmbH
  * Maxwell Render from Next Limit Technologies
  * Renderman Connection from MAXON Computer GmbH
  * Indigo Renderer, unbiased photorealistic renderer
  * SunFlow
  * V-ray
