Media Player Classic (MPC) is a compact media player for Microsoft Windows.
The application mimics the look and feel of the old, light-weight Windows
Media Player 6.4 but integrates most options and features found in modern
media players. It and its heirs are standard media players in K-Lite Codec
Pack.

Media Player Classic was originally created and maintained by a programmer
named "Gabest". It was developed as a closed-source application, but later
relicensed as free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
MPC is hosted under the `guliverkli` project at SourceForge.net. The project
itself is something of an umbrella organization for works by Gabest.

## [edit] Features

### [edit] MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 playback

Media Player Classic is capable of VCD, SVCD and DVD playback, without the
need to install any additional software or codecs. It has built-in codecs for
MPEG-2 video with support for subtitles and codecs for LPCM, MP2, AC3 and DTS
audio, and also contains an improved MPEG splitter that supports playback of
VCDs and SVCDs using its VCD/SVCD/XCD Reader. On October 30, 2005 Gabest added
*.mp4 and MPEG-4 Timed Text support.[1] An AAC decoding filter has been
present in MPC for a while, which makes MPC suitable for AAC playback in MP4,
and an alternative to Winamp and iTunes.

### [edit] DirectShow, QuickTime and RealPlayer architectures

Media Player Classic is primarily based on the DirectShow architecture, and
therefore automatically uses installed DirectShow decoding filters. For
instance, after the open source DirectShow decoding filter ffdshow has been
installed, fast and high quality decoding and postprocessing of the DivX,
Xvid, H.264 and Flash Video formats is available in MPC.

MPC provides DXVA beta support, for newer nVidia and ATI video cards when
using an H.264 or VC-1. This provides hardware-acceleration for playback.

In addition to DirectShow, MPC can also use the QuickTime and the RealPlayer
architectures (if installed on the computer) to play their native files.

### [edit] Matroska and Ogg containers

Media Player Classic supports native playback of OGM and Matroska container
formats. However, OGM audio playback is limited by a lack of support for the
CoreVorbis DirectShow filter, which mainly affects newer OGM files (c. 2006).
The crux of this problem is that MPC is hard-coded to use an older Vorbis
filter, so even if one installs newer filters, MPC is unable to use them.[2]

### [edit] TV tuners

MPC supports playback and recording of television if a supported TV tuner is
installed.

Homecinema Initial release March 29, 2006 (2006-03-29)  
Latest release 1.2.908.0 / 2008-11-29  
Website MPC Homecinema project  
Due to a stall in development of Media Player Classic in May 2006 many bugs
were left unfixed. The community at the Doom9 forum has since maintained their
own builds; one build is meant for fixing bugs and updating outdated libraries
with the release labeled as 6.4.9.1;[3] while the other one, Media Player
Classic Homecinema, is for adding new features while fixing bugs and updating
libraries.[4] Gabest, the main developer, stated that development of Media
Player Classic is not dead in March 2007, but has made no progress in updating
the source code.[5]

## [edit] GPL violations of MPC code

In April 2005, Gabest claimed that two media players, namely VX30 and The
KMPlayer, have violated the General Public License (GPL) by using portions of
Media Player Classic source code.[6] Maui X-Stream, the distributor of VX30,
which was previously accused of GPL violations with its CherryOS software,
have made no comment on the matter. However, the The KMPlayer authors have
published an official comment on their own forum that denies the alleged GPL
violation.[7]
