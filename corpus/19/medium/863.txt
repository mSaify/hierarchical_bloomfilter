xB Browser is an anonymous web browser designed to run on both the Tor and
XeroBank anonymity networks, and is available as component of the XeroBank
Installer. xB Browser was previously called Torpark,[1][2] and is released
under a license[3] that restricts usage by malware and commercial interests.
xB Browser was originally forked from Portable Firefox web browser with Tor
access built into it, but was redesigned from scratch in 2007. It is designed
for use on portable media such as a USB flash drive but it can also be used on
any hard disk drive. As such, a secure and encrypted connection to any of the
Tor or XeroBank routers can be created from any computer with a suitable
internet connection, and the browser clears all data that was created on the
portable drive upon exit or on demand. The original Torpark was created by
Steve Topletz using the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System.

## [edit] Tor network

Main article: Tor (anonymity network)

xB Browser works by routing Internet traffic through several "onion" servers,
obscuring the originating address. This does not naturally provide anonymity
for other Internet programs, only the xB Browser. However, other applications
data such as Pidgin can be routed through the Tor network via xB Browser by
directing the applications traffic to a SOCKS proxy at localhost, port 9050\.
This port can be changed via xB Config, an INI generator for xB Browser
located in its `App/` directory. For a more complete explanation of the
functioning of the system, see Tor.

Reading the Tor documentation is highly recommended to prevent configuration
mistakes that could compromise the user's anonymity. xB Browser is
preconfigured, and the settings, especially within the browser, should not be
modified unless done by an expert familiar with onion routing, and the
workings of xB Browser itself.

## [edit] XeroBank network

xB Browser is optimized for use on the XeroBank anonymity network, which is a
private and commercial broadband network operated by Xero Networks AG. The
XeroBank network routes traffic through at least two multi-jurisdictional
hops. In contrast to Tor, the XeroBank network is immune to 3rd-party traffic
injection, supports both TCP and UDP protocols, and performs channel
multiplexing for low observability, however it is run by a single entity. The
XeroBank network is accessible via SSH and OpenVPN protocols. xB Browser
internally manages a SSH connection to XeroBank, but will recognize and submit
to OpenVPN connections.

## [edit] Versions

Steve Topletz co-released Torpark v.1.5.0.7 with CULT OF THE DEAD
COW/Hacktivismo on 19 September 2006.[4][5][6]

The current version of the xB Browser is 2.0.0.17b

xB Browser is natively available for Microsoft Windows, but also runs on Linux
under WINE. A cross-compatible version is being developed based on xB Machine,
due to be available in August 2008.

## [edit] License and Controversy

xB Browser is released under the Torrify Ethical Software License Agreement,
or TESLA for short. This license is derived from the Hacktivismo Enhanced-
Source Software License Agreement, which is employed by Hacktivismo. This type
of license states that private use is unlimited, like GPL. Unlike GPL, it also
prohibits modification of xB Browser for commercial profit.

On January 30, 2009, John T. Haller posted to the PortableApps.com website
that XeroBank is violating the GPL.[7] The original TorPark browser was based
on the code to Portable Firefox, released under the GPL, and he assisted with
the creation of the original TorPark browser launcher, also licensed under the
GPL. The change to the TESLA license was done without his permission and the
current XeroBank browser that grew out of his original GPL code still contains
some elements of his code. Haller announced his intention of reposting the
source under the GPL on a new SourceForge project and involving the Free
Software Foundation and the GPL Violations project if further clarifications
are needed.
