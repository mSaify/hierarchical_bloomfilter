Voice over IP (VoIP) software is used to conduct telephone-like voice
conversations across IP based networks. For residential markets, VOIP phone
service is often cheaper than traditional PSTN phone service and can remove
geographic restrictions to telephone numbers (i.e. have a "New York" PSTN
phone number in Tokyo).

For enterprise or business markets, VoIP enables the enterprise to manage a
single network (the IP network) instead of separate voice and data networks,
while enabling advanced and flexible capabilities to the end user.

Softphones are end user based clients for initiating and receiving voice and
video communications over the IP network with the standard functionality of
most "original" telephones and usually allow integration with IP Phones and
USB Phones instead of utilizing a computer's microphone and speakers (or
headset). Most softphone clients run on the open SIP supporting various
codecs. Skype runs on a closed proprietary network. "Chat" programs now also
incorporate voice and video communications.

Other VoIP software applications include conferencing servers, intercom
systems, virtual FXOs and adapted telephony software which concurrently
support VoIP and PSTN like IVR systems, dial in dictation, on hold and call
recording servers.
