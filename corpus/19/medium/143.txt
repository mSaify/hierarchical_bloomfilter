AutoIt (pronounced aw-tow-it)[1] is a freeware automation language for
Microsoft Windows. In its earliest release, the software was primarily
intended to create automation scripts (sometimes called macros) for Microsoft
Windows programs.[2] Such scripts proved useful for "hands-free" completion of
highly repetitive tasks, such as rolling out a large number of PCs with
identical installation instructions. With later releases, AutoIt grew to
include enhancements in both programming language design and overall
functionality.

With the release of AutoIt version 3, the syntax of the programming language
was restructured to be more like the BASIC family of languages. A script can
be compiled into a compressed, stand-alone executable which can then be run on
computers that do not have the AutoIt interpreter installed.

A wide range of function libraries (known as UDF's, or "User Defined
Functions")[3] are included as standard or available from the website to add
specialized functionality.

AutoIt, like other scripting languages, is a third-generation programming
language using a classical data model, utilizing a variant data type that can
store several types of data, including arrays. It has a BASIC-like syntax and
is compatible with Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista, However support
for operating systems older than Windows 2000 has been dropped as of Autoit
v3.3.0.

AutoIt is distributed with an IDE based on the free SciTE editor. The compiler
and help text are fully integrated and provide a de facto standard environment
for developers using AutoIt.

## [edit] Usage

<IMG>

This section may stray from the topic of the article.  
Please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page.  
A popular use of AutoIt is the production of utility software for Microsoft
Windows. Common tasks, such as website monitoring, network monitoring, disk
defragging and backup, can be automated and combined to provide a customised
utility.

Another use of AutoIt is for "botting" in online games. Botting allows the
user to run a script which automates some repetitive action in the game -
usually so the script user can advance in the game more quickly. Use of AutoIt
in this way is frowned upon by some in the AutoIt community as it can generate
bad publicity; however, a few botting scripts can still be found in the
official AutoIt forums. Because botting is considered to be cheating by most
AutoIt users you should not expect much help in the use of AutoIt for this
purpose. Many forum members will refuse to help those that are trying to
create bots. This is not to say that support will not be provided; however,
you may have to wait long periods of time for answers regarding bots.

It is also used to simulate application users, whereby an application is
driven by an AutoIt script in place of manual application control during
software testing.

It has also been used to create malware.[4]

## [edit] Short History

  * Christmas 1998 - Idea of C program that should send keystrokes
  * January 1999 - First AutoIt Version (1.0)
  * August 1999 - AutoIt v2 and AutoItX
  * September 1999 - First AutoIt version with Compiler
  * December 2002 - AutoIt v3 (Public Beta)
  * February 2004 - AutoIt v3 (Stable)
  * September 2006 - Auto3Lib started
  * November 2007 - AutoIt v3.2.10.0 released, Auto3Lib incorporated into AutoIt v3
  * May 2008 - AutoIt v3.2.12.0 released, incorporating added GUI functionality
  * December 2008 - AutoIt (and AutoItX) v3.3.0.0 released

NOTE: At some point in the life of AutoIt (around version 2), the developers
released the source code under the GPL license in hopes to accelerate
development.[5] Soon, however, a few individuals[who?] took the code and
released their own competing products using a non-GPL license while giving no
credit to the original AutoIt developers[citation needed]. The AutoIt
developers decided to prevent such pilfering for future versions of AutoIt and
changed the license and limited access to the source code[citation needed].
The release of source code was stopped beginning with version 3.2.0 in August
2006.[citation needed]
