### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

    This article is about the iPAQ PDA; for the iPAQ Desktop Personal Computer, see iPAQ (desktop computer).
iPAQ presently refers to a Pocket PC and personal digital assistant first
unveiled by Compaq in April 2000; the name was borrowed from Compaq's earlier
iPAQ Desktop Personal Computers. Since Hewlett-Packard's acquisition of
Compaq, the product has been marketed by HP. The device is the main
competition to the Palm, but provides more multimedia capabilities using a
Microsoft Windows interface. In addition to this, there are several Linux
distributions that will also operate on some of these devices. Earlier, units
were modular. "Sleeve" accessories, technically called jackets, which slide
around the unit and add functionality such as a card reader, wireless
networking, GPS, and even extra batteries were used. Current iPAQs have most
of these features integrated into the base device itself.

Hewlett-Packard introduced the first SmartPhone iPaq Pocket PC that looks like
a regular cell phone and has VoIP capability. The series is the HP iPAQ 500
Series Voice Messenger.[1]

## [edit] History and development of iPAQ models

The iPaq was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation Western Research
Laboratory (WRL), the internal code name for it was Itsy. The name was used by
Compaq to continue their Compaq Aero handheld line. With the acquisition of
Compaq by Hewlett-Packard, HP stopped producing their Jornada line of
Microsoft Windows powered Pocket PCs and continued developing and marketing
Pocket PCs in the iPAQ line.

In June 2003, HP retired the h3xxx line of iPAQs and introduced the h1xxx line
of iPAQs targeted at price conscious buyers, the h2xxx consumer line, and the
h5xxx line, targeted at business customers. They were sold pre-installed with
the Windows Mobile for Pocket PC 2003 Operating System. The h63xx series of
iPAQs running the Phone Edition of Windows Mobile 2003, the hx47xx series and
the rz17xx series, both running the Second Edition of Windows Mobile 2003 were
introduced in August 2004. In February 2005 the iPAQ Mobile Messenger hw6500
series was introduced to selected media at the 3GSM conference in Cannes,
France.

In February 2007, HP announced the iPAQ rx4000 Mobile Media Companion devices
to work as a PDA/media device and rx5000 Travel Companion series to work as
PDA/GPS units. Both series of iPAQs work on the Windows Mobile 5 Operating
System. In the same month, HP announced their first Windows Mobile 6 device,
the iPAQ 500 Series Voice Messenger, with the Windows Mobile 6 Standard
Operating System, and numeric pad. Currently, the only iPAQs being sold which
run the Windows Mobile 5 Operating System are the hx2000 series, the rx5900
series and the hw6900 series.

The entire iPAQ line was completely revamped by the introduction of five new
iPAQ series to complement the introduction of the iPAQ 500 Series Voice
Messenger earlier in the year. The models announced were the 100 Series
Classic Handheld, the 200 Series Enterprise Handheld, the 300 Series Travel
Companion, the 600 Series Business Navigator and the 900 Series Business
Messenger. Of these newly introduced models, the 100 and 200 Series are
regular touchscreen PDAs without phone functionality, and hence run the
Windows Mobile 6 Classic Operating System. The 300 Series Travel Companion is
a first for HP since it is not a PDA. Marketed as a Personal Navigation
Device, it is a handheld GPS unit operating on the Windows CE 5.0 core
Operating System with an HP-built custom user-interface. The 600 and 900
series are phones with integrated GPS and 3G capabilities, running the Windows
Mobile 6 Professional Operating System. The 600 series featuring a numeric pad
and the 900 series features a full QWERTY keyboard.

## [edit] Model variations

Compaq iPAQ 3630

### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3600 series

Compaq's flagship iPAQs were the 3600 series models. Originally running the
Microsoft Windows for Pocket PC 2000 OS, these devices featured 12-bit color
displays, 32/64 MB of RAM, and 16 MB ROM.

Models in the 3600 series are:

3630, 3635, 3650 - which are identical models with 16 MB ROM and 32 MB RAM
sold via different marketing channels. The 3635 was accompanied by a CF
expansion sleeve that was sold separately with the other 2.

3660, 3670 - 64MB RAM. The 3670 was distributed in the US while the 3660 was
distributed in Europe.

A Pocket PC 2002 OS upgrade is available, but the smaller ROM requires some
software such as the media player to install in volatile RAM instead of the
ROM as in the previous Pocket PC 2000.

As used units are low price, they are a great way to inexpensively get started
with a PDA.

While limited by no on-board expansion slot, the iPAQ 3600 series memory and
functionality can still be expanded by optional Compact Flash and PCMCIA
sleeves, which allow users to add memory and peripherals. Some of these
sleeves contain extra batteries to extend the iPAQ's battery life under the
strain of added devices.

### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3100 series

This was identical to the H3600 series, except it used a black and white
screen and the central D-Pad (up/down/left/right controller) was black instead
of silver. This only came with the original Pocket PC operating system (Pocket
PC 2000).

### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3700 series

These devices had the exact same form factor as their 3600 model predecessors,
however, they had an increased ROM size and ran the PPC2002 OS natively.

### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3800 series

Compaq's original high-end series models. These units were also the first to
include 16-bit screens, incorporated an SD card reader and the highest RAM
capacity of any Pocket PC. They were also the first to offer integrated
Bluetooth, on select models such as the 3870. The 3850 had 206 MHz StrongARM
CPU, with 32MB ROM and 64MB RAM, 240x320 TFT screen, running Microsoft Pocket
PC 2002.

### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3900 series

#### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3950

ROM 32Mb RAM 64Mb 1x Secure Digital (SD) port IrDA interface

Note: this base model does not have a Bluetooth interface.

#### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3955

400MHz Intel XScale processor Windows CE 3.0 (Pocket PC 2002) ROM 32Mb RAM
64Mb 16-bit color TFT LCD display with over 65,000 colors 1x Secure Digital
(SD) port Consumer IR and IrDA (115kbit/s) No Bluetooth interface on 3955 -
see 3970/75 External i/o ports -- USB/Serial software includes nevo tv remote,
calculator and windows media 8.0 optional Expansion Packs with removable
batteries - for standard PC and CF cards

#### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3970

US commercial / worldwide It uses a 400mhz processor and has 48MB of ROM and
64MB of RAM. It has one SD card slot. It has IrDA and Bluetooth 1.1
interfaces. Expansion systems are available for power and for expansion cards
such as wireless. Software includes nevo tv remote, calculator and Windows
Media Player.

#### [edit] Compaq iPAQ H3975

This model is identical to the H3970, it is the US retail release

### [edit] HP iPAQ H1900 series

After HP's acquisition of Compaq, the 1900 series was the answer to Palm's
budget units. A smaller, slimmer frame made it more competitive in terms of
portability. The HP devices contained 64 MB of main memory, larger than all
other budget units, and ran PPC2002 (H1910 only) or 2003. They introduced
removable batteries, allowing the user to buy extra batteries and swap as
necessary. Unlike older iPAQs, many existing iPAQ accessories were
incompatible or unsupported due to the budget nature of the new series.

The H1900 series did not implement support for RS232,[2] so many GPS devices
are incompatible with the handhelds in the series. Only the rx1950/rx1955 had
a serial interface implemented.[3]

### [edit] HP iPAQ H5400 series

Introduced as the next generation of the iPAQ corporate line after the 3900
series, adding Wi-Fi support, improved Bluetooth and a biometric scanner.
However, the 5400 was plagued with many bugs, though most were corrected
through firmware upgrades. The CPU is the ARM-based Intel XScale PXA250.

### [edit] HP iPAQ H5500 series

A corrected version of the 5400 series with double the RAM (128 MB) running on
PPC2003, PXA255 CPU.

### [edit] HP iPAQ H5100 series

A cutdown version of the 5500 series, without Wi-Fi support and the extra RAM
(only 64 MB). iPAQ Backup allows for safe, easy, automatic data copying

### [edit] HP iPAQ H2200 series

Targeting the general consumer, the 2200 series is almost every bit as capable
as their corporate counterparts (less RAM, no integrated Wi-Fi, no biometric
scanner). Main memory size was 64 MB RAM, PPC2003, better support for iPAQ
accessories than the 1900 series though still no iPAQ expansion "sleeve"
support. Bluetooth, SD card and CompactFlash card support built-in. There is
an advanced IR port built into the h2210,the h2212e and the h2215, and the
software bundle includes a program which essentially turns this device into a
universal remote control.

### [edit] HP iPAQ H4300 series

Similar to the 2200 series in terms of features, the 4300 series targets the
corporate audience by having a beefier battery and integrated Wi-Fi in
addition to Bluetooth. No CompactFlash reader, but does have a SD-card and
SDIO slot. A thumb keyboard is integrated into the device.

### [edit] HP iPAQ H4100 series

Essentially the corporate version of the 1900 series with many of the
functionalities that were stripped from the budget unit. Also adds Wi-Fi and
SDIO. Closer to the 4300-series internally. It came with PPC2003.

### [edit] HP iPAQ hx2000 series

Aimed at the business market, this series of PDAs supports built-in Wi-Fi (but
not in the hx21xx sequence), Bluetooth, SD Card and CF Card slots, and Windows
Mobile 2003 SE. Some have included a Microsoft Windows CE 5.0 firmware upgrade
disc. The different models have some different features.

#### [edit] HP iPAQ hx21xx sequence

This series of PDAs sported only the barebones set of features listed above,
and ran a slower 312 MHz XScale PXA270 processor. No fingerprint reader or Wi-
Fi and only 64 MB of memory.

#### [edit] HP iPAQ hx24xx sequence

520 MHz PXA270 CPU, 64 MB RAM and ROM. WiFi and Bluetooth.

#### [edit] HP iPAQ hx27xx sequence

A very full featured business class PDA. Sporting a 624 MHz Intel PXA270
XScale processor, 128 MB of RAM and ROM (each), bluetooth, WiFI and a built-in
biometric fingerprint reader, this model set is aimed at high-security and
-performance enterprises. The fingerprint reader, with the proprietary HP
ProtectTools software, can create "encrypted folders" in RAM or on storage
cards (in these models' case, the iPAQ File Store, the SD Card, or the CF
Card) to prevent anyone from swiping the memory cards and reading sensitive
company-critical data. The processor, running at the aforementioned 624 MHz,
helps with the encryption/decryption processes (HP ProtectTools can also
encrypt the entire contents of the onboard memory).

### [edit] HP iPAQ hx4700 series

The hx4700 series was designed to replace the corporate-targeted 5500 line.
Specifications included a sturdy magnesium-alloy casing, 4-inch diagonal VGA
screen at 65K colors, integrated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 1.2, MMC and Secure Digital
slot with SDIO, Compact Flash slot, 64 MB of RAM and 128 MB of ROM, and an
Intel XScale PXA270 624 MHz processor.

The unit ships with a removable 1800 mAh battery in the original package, with
a 3600 mAh extended battery as an option. The hx4700 is known as the first and
only[citation needed] Windows Mobile PDA with a dual-mode touchpad.

By design, models of this series are not compatible with previous IPAQ jacket
accessories, but the proprietary USB connector at the bottom is still the
same. No case is included in the factory-shipped box; the unit comes with a
screen cover only. 3.5 mm headphone jack accepts iPaq 55xx series 4-pin
plugs.[4]

At first release, the hx4700 units ran Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition.
Pocket Informant 2005, built-in encryption software were also included. The
after-market NEVO TV (remote control software) is incompatible with the Fast
IR included with the device, as NEVO Remote requires Consumer IR.

In April 2006 HP finally issued a Windows Mobile 5 upgrade option for hx4700
users, available at the HP website. The upgrade included updates for most of
the other included software, including Pocket Informant.

In June 2007 an unaffiliated Russian programmer updated the WM5 ROM to a much
improved WM5 AKU 3.5, thereby fixing many problems the earlier WM5 (AKU 2.02)
had been plagued with and giving an old device a "second life."[5]

In August 2007, the same Russian programmer released a WM6 ROM for the hx4700,
which was in its fourth revision as of January 2008.[6]

In October 2007 a so called "ROM kitchen" was adapted for the hx4700 using the
above WM6 ROM.[7]

### [edit] HP iPAQ rz1700 series

The HP iPAQ rz1700 series is a series of PocketPC's that were designed for the
budget user. They have 32MB of RAM which has been divided into 22 MB volatile
and 10 MB non-volatile that was known as iPAQ File Store, a built-in
microphone, a SDIO slot, 3.5 mm headphone jack, a 3 inch 240x320 colour screen
capable of displaying 65,355 colours and a 203 MHz Samsung processor. The
PocketPC's were shipped with Windows Mobile 2003 SE which included all of the
standard programs such as Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, a PIM etc. They also came
with Macromedia Flash Player for mobile and a redesigned home screen that the
user could turn on and off depending on whether or not the user wanted it.

### [edit] HP iPAQ rx4000, rx3100, rx3400 and rx3700 series

Billed as "Mobile Media Companions", some of these models feature Nevo
personal media software, onboard 1.2 megapixel cameras (rx3400 and rx3700),
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and an onboard Secure Digital card slot for extra documents
or media.

The rx4240 and rx4250 are great medium entry PDAs: bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Windows
Mobile 5, Mobile Office and heaps more are preloaded. The rx4000 range
features a Samsung 400 MHz Processor, and boasts a larger 128 MB ROM and 64 MB
SDRAM, Up to 64 MB user-available memory on the 4240.

The rx3100 and rx3400 had 32 MB of RAM and 300 MHz processors, whereas the
rx3700 had 64 MB of RAM and a 400 MHz processor. The latter also came with a
1440 mAh battery as standard, rather than the rx3400's 920 mAh unit.

These models have been known to suffer from a bug related to the way the iPAQ
File Store, the rx3700's ROM, operates and manages files. This bug prevents
the user from deleting or renaming files on the ROM, causing significant
deficiencies in its operation. This bug is known by HP, but there is not yet
an official solution for the problem.

The current version of the Windows Mobile 2003 SE operating system has been
known to cause issues with Bluetooth functionality. Some patches have been
released by the manufacturer, such as for Bluetooth headphones, but others,
such as connectivity with HP GPS devices, have not been released. The devices
continue to be non-functional for these models despite being published as
compatible.

### [edit] HP iPAQ h6300 series

<IMG>

<IMG>

Ipaq h6340

Pocket PC Phone. Contains a GSM phone, 64 MB RAM, 168 MHz Texas Instruments
OMAP processor, and comes with a detachable thumb keyboard. Also includes VGA
quality camera and 1800 mAh battery. It has built in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
(802.11b).

T-Mobile used to sell the h6315 but has decided to withdraw it from the
market. The firmware was never updated to remove all of the bugs which cause
sporadic behaviour, including dropped calls, not answering calls, turning off,
erasing all user memory (factory reset), etc.

Variants include the h6340 which is sold in parts of Europe without a camera
through normal distribution points- hence is not carrier specific. The h6365
has identical specifications to the h6315 but it is not signed to a carrier.

### [edit] HP iPAQ Mobile Messenger hw6500 series

This iPAQ is the first Pocket PC phone to have built in Global Positioning
System (GPS) capabilities with support for NMEA. When no GPS signal is
available the device attempts to calculate its location by switching to cell
triangulation. It has an integrated keyboard and unique 240x240 resolution. It
may seem that the screen size can be an advantage regarding the standby time,
but there are reports that actually many software products do not work on this
device as they should because they were created for the standard 320x240
resolution (menus are not fully visible, hidden buttons- sort of problems).
However this issue can be resolved via 3rd party virtual screen applications
enabling you to scroll down to the truncated buttons.

It has two card slots SD SDIO and mini-SD and like its predecessor the h6300,
two versions are/were available: one with camera and one without.

Most notably, compared to the previous model, this unit does not have internal
support for WiFi.

Specifications can be found here.

This unit, as with most similar units, comes in a variety of languages. For a
number of reasons, including the assurance of price in higher priced markets,
languages are designed to not be changeable on the units. For example, if you
have a unit with a German operating system, you cannot "officially" change the
language.

The language can, however, be changed to English at this time by flashing the
BIOS using upgrades released by HP.

### [edit] HP iPAQ Mobile Messenger hw6900 series

These units entered the market in late 2006. Anticipated specifications can be
found here (PDF)

Like other iPAQs released in the prior to this one, this unit has internal
support for WiFi as well as Windows Mobile 5. It includes a GSM phone,
Bluetooth, and GPS built-in.

The IPAQ HW6915 is available in the market as of 2007.

### [edit] HP iPAQ rw6800 series

In addition to mobile messaging, the rw6828 offers virtually every
connectivity option under the sun, including tri-band (900/1800/1900MHz) GSM,
GPRS/EDGE, Bluetooth 1.2, Infrared and 802.11b Wi-Fi. All of these features
can be turned off, which not only conserves battery power but also enables
users to operate the device like a regular PDA during air travel.

Naturally, the phone/push-e-mail combination puts the device in direct
competition with the BlackBerry. However, one qualm that we've always had with
the BlackBerry is that its lack of multimedia features alienates non-corporate
users and even corporate customers that use their device for non-work
purposes. Although RIM promises that a "prosumer" BlackBerry is in the works,
HP has beaten it to the punch with the rw6828, which offers a slew of
multimedia functions.

Audio playback is catered for by an integrated FM radio and PocketMusic MP3
playback software. These can be tapped into using either a regular set of
headphones or the integrated dual stereo speakers, and both options offer up
impressive sound quality. You'll want to buy an expansion card to stick into
the device's mini-SD slot, however, as it only comes with 128MB of flash ROM.
These audio features are certainly attractive, but make no mistake, it won't
replace the intuitive interface and long battery life of your current MP3
player. But that's OK, since HP reps said it themselves at the launch event in
Hong Kong -- "we're not targeting iPod."

In addition to audio, the rw6828 also supports video playback using any
Windows Mobile 5 media player software such as VLC. Again, picture quality is
pleasing and playback is smooth.

Rounding out the device's excellent multimedia feature-set is an integrated HP
2.0-megapixel camera with a flash and self-portrait mirror. This is similar to
the O2 Atom's camera offering, and while shots are suitable for e-mailing
around to your mates, the quality is distinctly underwhelming and you
certainly won't be making prints of any photographs.

Since the device runs on Windows Mobile 5 Phone Edition, it also comes with
Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Internet Explorer and Outlook 2002 pre-
installed. These are handy for those that need to stay productive whilst on
the move, and offer more features than many of the third-party software
offerings available for the BlackBerry. However, keep in mind that the mobile
version of PowerPoint only allows you to view, not edit, presentations, so
don't bank on making last-minute modifications before entering the board room.

the first iPAQ from HP running the Windows Mobile 6 Operating System. It is
also the first and currently, the only iPAQ which runs the SmartPhone version
of the Windows Mobile series of Operating Systems from Microsoft. Unlocked
phones purchased from HP or 3rd party vendors are "app locked", preventing
some 3rd party software from being installed. There are unlocking utilities
available on the internet. It has been discontinued by HP.

## [edit] Alternative operating systems for the iPAQ

### [edit] NetBSD

NetBSD will install and run on iPAQ.

### [edit] Familiar Linux

An alternative Linux-based OS is available for the iPAQ, called Familiar. It
is available with the Opie or GPE GUI environment, or as a base Linux system
with no GUI if preferred.

Both Opie and GPE provide the usual PIM suite (calendar, contacts, todo list,
and notes) as well as a long list of other applications. Support for
handwriting recognition, on-screen keyboard, bluetooth, IrDA and add-on
hardware such as keyboards are standard in both environments.

The v0.8.4 (2006-08-20) version supports HP iPAQ H3xxx and H5xxx series of
handhelds, and introduces initial support for the HP iPAQ H2200, Hx4700, and
H6300 series.

about linux un h36** see http://www.elinux.org/Flameman/ipaq/status

### [edit] Plan 9 from Bell Labs

Plan 9 from Bell Labs runs on the iPAQ. The nickname of the architecture is
"bitsy," after the name of the ARM-based chipsets used in many of the
machines.

### [edit] Ã ngstrÃ¶m distribution

See Ã ngstrÃ¶m Distribution

## [edit] Upgrades

Some of the iPAQ series are upgradeable to newer versions of the Windows
Mobile software. This is limited to very recent releases, such as the hx2000
series. Upgrades are available from HP for approximately US$39.99 + shipping,
and include the Windows Mobile 5.0 software and an updated version of
Microsoft ActiveSync.

### [edit] Internal Li-ion battery

iPAQ model 3100 - 3700 are fitted with internal Li-ion battery PN 167648 3.7v
1500mAh which can be replaced with a 2200mAh upgrade. The same battery is used
in the iPAQ jacket PN 173396-001 PCMCIA (PC port), which can also be upgraded
to 2200mAh.

### [edit] RAM Upgrade

It is possible to have the internal RAM of an iPAQ H3970 upgraded to 128Mb,
however this requires a specialist service as the RAM chips are surface mount
BGAs which cannot be removed with normal soldering equipment.
