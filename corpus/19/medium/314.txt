This article is about the computer program. For the chemical rodent killer,
see rat poison.

In Unix computing, ratpoison is a free window manager for the X Window System
primarily written by Shawn Betts. Its user interface and much of its
functionality are inspired by the GNU Screen terminal multiplexer. Its name
comes from the fact that it lets the user manage windows without using the
mouse (or "rat"[1]). Ratpoison is free software licensed under the GNU General
Public License.

Its intended successor is Stumpwm; ratpoison was growing increasingly large,
and Betts decided to largely reimplement its functionality in Common Lisp.[2]

  2. ^ "StumpWM grew out of the authors' frustration with writing ratpoison in C. Very quickly we realized we were building into ratpoison lispy-emacs style paradigms. We had a REPL hanging off 'C-t :', hooks, and a growing subset of Common Lisp in the implementation ... It was clear what we really wanted was a window manager written in Lisp from the ground up with lots of room for customizing and real-time hacking." "Background" from the Stumpwm wiki
