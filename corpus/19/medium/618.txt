The Nintendo DS Browser is a version of the Opera web browser for use on the
Nintendo DS, developed by Opera Software and Nintendo. The Nintendo DS Browser
comes in separate versions for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo DS Lite;[3]
this is due to differing physical size requirements for the memory expansion
cartridge included with the browser.

## [edit] Launch

On February 15, 2006, the Opera Software company announced plans to develop a
web browser for the Nintendo DS. Opera Company also worked to put Opera Web
Browser onto Nintendo DS.[4]

The Nintendo DS Browser was released first in Japan on July 24, 2006 and it
was released later in Europe on October 6, 2006 for Â£30 (the same as an
ordinary DS game). The Australian release date was on January 18, 2007 and
retailed for AU$69.95. (~US$60)[5] However, in Australia, only the DS Lite
version was released in stores; a limited stock of the DS Original version was
only available directly through Nintendo Australia.

The North American release date was on June 4, 2007 for $29.99.[2] Like the
Australian release, only the Lite version was available in stores, and the DS
Original version was only available online in US.[6]

The Nintendo DS Browser

Nintendo DS Browser makes use of the Nintendo DS's touchscreen for input, with
an on-screen keyboard as well as handwriting recognition and a stock of pre-
set text (for example, the .com and .org top-level domains).

The browser can render pages in two modes, Small Screen Rendering (SSR) or
Overview. In Small Screen Rendering mode, the contents of the page are
displayed in a single column fitting the width of the screen - for example, a
page featuring two columns of text side-by-side would be displayed as a single
column, one after the other. In Overview mode, a scaled-down version of the
page is displayed on the touchscreen with a small selection box which can be
moved around using the stylus. The contents of the selection box are displayed
on the top screen at their full size. This selection can be brought into the
touchscreen to perform such actions as click on links or entering text in
boxes.

The browser connects to the network through IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi access points or
hotspots using the built-in wireless capability of the Nintendo DS. While WEP
encryption is supported, WPA encryption is not.

Nintendo has partnered with Internet security company Astaro to integrate web
filtering technology into the Nintendo DS Browser. Called Astaro Parental
Control, the technology acts as a proxy filter, providing the option of
blocking inappropriate content.[7] This is provided free of charge and can be
activated through a simple menu option.

The Nintendo DS browser supports JavaScript and SSL in web pages, but does not
support plugins like Adobe Flash.[8] Due to limited system resources, most
other dynamic media, such as videos or sound, will not work in the browser.

## [edit] DS memory expansion pak

European DS Browser cartridge and DS Lite expansion pak

The Memory Expansion Pak, much like the Rumble Pak for the Nintendo DS is a DS
Option Pak. When inserted into a DS's GBA slot, the Memory Pak adds 8MB of RAM
to the DS.[citation needed]

Two versions of the Memory Expansion Pack are available. One is compatible
with both the DS and DS Lite, although the cartridge's size causes it to stick
out of the latter. A smaller version is available which fits flush with the
body of the DS Lite, but it can be used in the original DS if modified. Two
different Browser packages are available, one containing the large Expansion
Pak, and one containing the Lite-only Expansion Pak. Availability varies by
region - in Japan and Europe, both were available at launch, while in North
America and other regions, the version containing the larger Expansion Pak is
only available by mail order.

It has slight similarities to the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak. The Nintendo DS
Browser is the only official Nintendo DS software that requires this hardware,
but it has been suggested that the expansion could be used for other
software,[9] including optional graphical updates that would allow a better
experience if the card is inserted, in addition to other games that could
require the expansion. However, it has been utilised in a number of pieces of
homebrew software such as DSLinux unofficially. It has also been cloned as
part of the EZ Flash 3-in-1 SLOT-2 device.

The Nintendo DSi, a newer model, no longer includes the Game Boy Advance slot
(SLOT-2), so it cannot use the memory expansion pak. However, the DSi does
have more RAM and a built-in web browser.

## [edit] Critical reception

Review scores Publication Score  
IGN 3.5 out of 10 [10]  
Reviews for the Nintendo DS Browser were generally mixed. Many reviewers noted
shortcomings such as extended loading times and lack of Flash support for
audio and videos.

In August 2007, the Nintendo DS Browser was quietly discontinued in North
America,[11][12] although the Original DS version is still available from
Nintendo's online store for the Nintendo DS.[13]
