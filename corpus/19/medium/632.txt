(March 2008)  
In computing, the Fink project is an effort to port Unix programs to Mac OS X.
Fink uses dpkg and APT (Debian's package management system), as well as its
own frontend program, `fink` (which is implemented as a set of Perl modules).

## [edit] Implementation

Fink features a binary distribution for quick and easy installation, as well
as a source distribution for users preferring more flexibility. In addition to
command-line tools for handling packages, FinkCommander provides a GUI. The
user can configure Fink to utilize the stable or unstable tree for packages.
The unstable tree typically has newer releases, but has not stood the test of
time.

Fink can be used to install newer versions of packages installed by Mac OS X
or to install packages not included in Mac OS X. Fink stores all its data in
the directory "`/sw`" by default (though this can be changed if initially
compiling fink itself from source code). This goes against the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard's recommendation to use "`/usr/local`"; the reasons given
in the Fink FAQ are that other installers might overwrite Fink's files under
"`/usr/local`", and that having an entirely separate directory makes it easier
to disable the binaries and libraries that Fink installs.[1] Within Fink's
directory, a FHS-like layout (`/sw/bin`, `/sw/include`, `/sw/lib`, etc.) is
used.

## [edit] History

The Fink project was started in December 2000 by German hacker Christoph
Pfisterer. The name "Fink" is German for finch and is related to the Darwin
operating system (that lies at the core of Mac OS X), through Charles Darwin's
study of diversity among finches.

Christoph Pfisterer left the project[2] out of frustration in November of
2001. Since then, several people have stepped in and picked up support for
Fink and as of March 2008, the project is managed by 6 administrators, 89
developers, and a very active community.

The Fink community released support for Mac OS X v10.4 on 18 Feb. 2006 and for
Mac OS X Leopard on the day it was released (26 October 2007).
