DxDiag from DirectX 10.1 (6.00.6001) running on Windows Vista and DirectX 10.1  
Details  
Included with Microsoft Windows 98 onwards  
Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs)
for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and
video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began
with Direct, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay,
DirectSound, and so forth. DirectX, then, was the generic term for all of
these APIs and became the name of the collection. After the introduction of
the Xbox, Microsoft has also released multiplatform game development APIs such
as XInput, which are designed to supplement or replace individual DirectX
components.

Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the
development of video games for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Xbox, and
Microsoft Xbox 360. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for
visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is
the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names
"DirectX" and "Direct3D" used interchangeably.

The DirectX software development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in
redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers
for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or
explicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX
was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.[1] Windows 98 and Windows
NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released
since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are
proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the
SDK samples.

The latest versions of Direct3D, namely, Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 9Ex, are
only officially available for Windows Vista, because each of these new
versions was built to depend upon the new Windows Display Driver Model that
was introduced for Windows Vista. The new Vista/WDDM graphics architecture
includes a new video memory manager that supports virtualizing graphics
hardware to multiple applications and services such as the Desktop Window
Manager

DxDiag from DirectX 6.1 (4.06.02.0436) running on  
Windows 95 and DirectX 1.0

The components of DirectX are

  * DirectX Graphics, which consists of several APIs: 
    * DirectDraw: for drawing 2D Graphics (raster graphics). Now deprecated, though still in use by a number of games and as a video renderer in media applications.
    * Direct3D (D3D): for drawing 3D graphics.
    * DXGI: for enumerating adapters and monitors and managing swap chains for Direct3D 10 and up.
  * DirectInput: for interfacing with input devices including keyboards, mice, joysticks, or other game controllers. Deprecated after version 8 in favor of XInput for Xbox360 controllers or standard WM INPUT window message processing for keyboard and mouse input.
  * DirectPlay: for communication over a local-area or wide-area network. Deprecated after version 8.
  * DirectSound: for the playback and recording of waveform sounds. 
    * DirectSound3D (DS3D): for the playback of 3D sounds.
  * DirectMusic: for playback of soundtracks authored in DirectMusic Producer.
  * DirectX Media: comprising DirectAnimation for 2D/3D[2] web animation, DirectShow (soon to be deprecated for Media Foundation) for multimedia playback and streaming media, DirectX Transform for web interactivity, and Direct3D Retained Mode for higher level 3D graphics. DirectShow contains DirectX plugins for audio signal processing and DirectX Video Acceleration for accelerated video playback.

As of April 2005 DirectShow is no longer a part of the DirectX API. It now
comes bundled along with the Platform SDK.

  * DirectX Media Objects: support for streaming objects such as encoders, decoders, and effects.
  * DirectSetup: for the installation of DirectX components. Not a game API per se.

DirectX functionality is provided in the form of COM-style objects and
interfaces. Additionally, while not DirectX components themselves, managed
objects have been built on top of some parts of DirectX, such as managed
Direct3D 9.[3]and the XNA graphics library[4]

### [edit] DirectX 10

See also: Direct3D 10, Direct3D and Vista, and List of games with DirectX 10
support

A major update to DirectX API, DirectX 10 ships with and is only available
with Windows Vista; previous versions of Windows such as Windows XP are not
able to officially run DirectX 10-exclusive applications.[5] There are
unofficial ports of DirectX 10 to XP[6], however these do not always work
reliably[citation needed]. Changes for DirectX 10 were extensive.

Many former parts of DirectX API were deprecated in the latest DirectX SDK and
will be preserved for compatibility only: DirectInput was deprecated in favor
of XInput, DirectSound was deprecated in favor of XACT and lost support for
hardware accelerated audio, since Vista audio stack renders sound in software
on the CPU. The DirectPlay DPLAY.DLL was also removed and was replaced with
dplayx.dll; games that rely on this DLL must duplicate it and rename it to
dplay.dll.

In order to achieve backwards compatibility, DirectX in Windows Vista contains
several versions of Direct3D:[7]

  * Direct3D 9: emulates Direct3D 9 behavior as it was on Windows XP. Details and advantages of Vista's Windows Display Driver Model are hidden from the application if WDDM drivers are installed. This is the only API available if there are only XP graphic drivers (XPDM) installed, after an upgrade to Vista for example.
  * Direct3D 9Ex (known internally during Windows Vista development as 9.0L or 9.L, the L standing for Vista's codename: Longhorn): allows full access to the new capabilities of WDDM (if WDDM drivers are installed) while maintaining compatibility for existing Direct3D applications. The Windows Aero user interface relies on D3D 9Ex.
  * Direct3D 10: Designed around the new driver model in Windows Vista and featuring a number of improvements to rendering capabilities and flexibility, including Shader Model 4.

Direct3D 10.1 is an incremental update of Direct3D 10.0 which is shipped with,
and requires, Windows Vista Service Pack 1.[8] This release mainly sets a few
more image quality standards for graphics vendors, while giving developers
more control over image quality.[9] It also adds support for parallel cube
mapping and requires that the video card supports Shader Model 4.1 or higher
and 32-bit floating-point operations. Direct3D 10.1 still fully supports
Direct3D 10 hardware, but in order to utilize all of the new features, updated
hardware is required.[10] As of November 29, 2008, only ATI's HD4xxx and
HD3xxx series and S3's chrome 4xx GTX series of GPUs are fully compliant,
Nvidia has yet to release a DX10.1 compliant card. All future DX11 hardware
will also support DX10.1 in order to be DX11 compliant.

### [edit] Direct3D 11

Main article: Direct3D 11

Microsoft unveiled Direct3D 11 at the Gamefest 08 event in Seattle, with the
major scheduled features including GPGPU support, tessellation[11][12]
support, and improved multi-threading support to assist video game developers
in developing games that better utilize multi-core processors. Direct3D 11
will run on Windows 7. Parts of the new API such as multi-threaded resource
handling can be supported on Direct3D 9/10/10.1-class hardware. Hardware
tessellation and Shader Model 5.0 will require Direct3D 11 supporting
hardware. [13] Microsoft has since released the Direct3D 11 Technical Preview.
[14]. DirectX 11 is scheduled to be released as part of the Windows 7
operating system. It is included in the Windows 7 beta (build 7000).

## [edit] History

In late 1994 Microsoft was on the verge of releasing its next operating
system, Windows 95. The main factor that would determine the value consumers
would place on their new operating system very much rested on what programs
would be able to run on it. Three Microsoft employees â Craig Eisler, Alex
St. John, and Eric Engstrom â were concerned because programmers tended to
see Microsoft's previous operating system, MS-DOS, as a better platform for
game programming, meaning few games would be developed for Windows 95 and the
operating system would not be as much of a success.

DOS allowed direct access to video cards, keyboards and mice, sound devices,
and all other parts of the system, while Windows 95, with its protected memory
model, restricted access to all of these, working on a much more standardized
model. Microsoft needed a way that would let programmers get what they wanted,
and they needed it quickly; the operating system was only months away from
being released. Eisler (development lead), St. John, and Engstrom (program
manager) worked together to fix this problem, with a solution that they
eventually named DirectX.

The first version of DirectX was released in September 1995 as the Windows
Games SDK. It was the Win32 replacement for the DCI and WinG APIs for Windows
3.1. Simply put, DirectX allowed all versions of Microsoft Windows, starting
with Windows 95, to incorporate high-performance multimedia. Eisler wrote
about the frenzy to build DirectX 1 through 5 in his blog.[15]

The DirectX team faced the challenging task of testing each DirectX release
against an array of hardware and software. A variety of different graphics
cards, audio cards, motherboards, CPUs, input devices, games, and other
multimedia applications were tested with each beta and final release. The
DirectX team also built and distributed tests that allowed the hardware
industry to confirm that new hardware designs and driver releases would be
compatible with DirectX.

Prior to DirectX, Microsoft had included OpenGL on their Windows NT platform.
At the time, OpenGL required "high-end" hardware and was focused on
engineering and CAD uses. Direct3D was intended to be a lightweight partner to
OpenGL focused on game use. As 3D gaming grew, OpenGL evolved to include
better support for programming techniques for interactive multimedia
applications like games, giving developers choice between using OpenGL or
Direct3D as the 3D graphics API for their applications. At that point a
"battle" began between supporters of the cross-platform OpenGL and the
Windows-only Direct3D, which many argued was another example of Microsoft's
embrace, extend and extinguish business tactic (see Fahrenheit or Direct3D vs.
OpenGL). Interestingly, OpenGL was supported at Microsoft by the DirectX team.
If a developer chose to use OpenGL 3D graphics API, the other APIs of DirectX
are often combined with OpenGL in computer games because OpenGL does not
include all of DirectX's functionality (such as sound or joystick support).
However, the combination of OpenGL and SDL for this purpose is becoming
increasingly popular.[citation needed]

In a console-specific version, DirectX was used as a basis for Microsoft's
Xbox and Xbox 360 console API. The API was developed jointly between Microsoft
and Nvidia, who developed the custom graphics hardware used by the original
Xbox. The Xbox API is similar to DirectX version 8.1, but is non-updateable
like other console technologies. The Xbox was code named DirectXbox, but this
was shortened to Xbox for its commercial name.[16]

In 2002 Microsoft released DirectX 9 with support for the use of much longer
shader programs than before with pixel and vertex shader version 2.0.
Microsoft has continued to update the DirectX suite since then, introducing
shader model 3.0 in DirectX 9.0c, released in August 2004.

As of April 2005, DirectShow was removed from DirectX and moved to the
Microsoft Platform SDK instead. The DirectX SDK is, however, still required to
build the DirectShow samples[17].

Notes

  1. DirectX 4 was never released. Raymond Chen explained in his book, The Old New Thing, that after DirectX 3 was released, Microsoft began developing versions 4 and 5 at the same time. Version 4 was to be a shorter-term release with small features, whereas version 5 would be a more substantial release. The lack of interest from game developers in the features slated for DirectX 4 resulted in its being shelved, and the corpus of documents that already distinguished the two new versions resulted in Microsoft choosing to not re-use version 4 to describe features intended for version 5.[20]
  2. The version number as reported by Microsoft's DxDiag tool (version 4.09.0000.0900 and higher) use the x.xx.xxxx.xxxx format for version numbers. However, the DirectX and Windows XP MSDN page claims that the registry always has in the x.xx.xx.xxxx format. Put another way, when the above table lists a version as '4.09.00.0904' Microsoft's DxDiag tool may have it as '4.09.0000.0904'.[21]

### [edit] History of DirectX logo

The logo originally resembled a deformed radiation warning symbol.
Controversially, the original name for the DirectX project was the "Manhattan
Project", a reference to the US nuclear weapons initiative and its ultimate
outcome â the nuclear bombing of Japan. Alex St. John, the director of the
DirectX project at its inception, claims that this connotation is intentional,
and that DirectX and its sister project, the Xbox (which shares a similar
logo), are meant to displace Japanese videogame makers from their dominance of
the industry.[22] However, this meaning is publicly denied by Microsoft, which
instead claims that it is merely artistic design.[22]

### [edit] Awards and accolades

On January 8, 2007, DirectX (specifically, Direct3D) earned a Technology &
Engineering Emmy Award for Microsoft and partners AMD and Nvidia Corporation
"for pioneering work in near and real-time fully programmable shading via
modern graphics processors."[23]

In 2002, DirectX was the Game Developer Magazine Front Line Awards Hall of
Fame award winner for Microsoft [24]

On May 31, 2001, DirectX 8.0 was awarded a PC World World Class Award for
Microsoft as the "Most Promising Software Newcomer"[25]

On December 11, 2000, DirectX 8 - Direct3D was awarded a Game Developer
Magazine Front Line Award for Microsoft in the category "Programming
Library"[26]

## [edit] Compatibility

APIs such as Direct3D and DirectSound need to interact with hardware, and they
do this through a device driver. Hardware manufacturers have to write these
drivers for a particular DirectX version's device driver interface (or DDI),
and test each individual piece of hardware to make them DirectX compatible.
Some hardware devices only have DirectX compatible drivers (in other words,
one must install DirectX in order to use that hardware). Early versions of
DirectX included an up-to-date library of all of the DirectX compatible
drivers currently available. This practice was stopped however, in favor of
the web-based Windows Update driver-update system, which allowed users to
download only the drivers relevant to their hardware, rather than the entire
library.

Prior to DirectX 10, DirectX was designed to be backward compatible with older
drivers, meaning that newer versions of the APIs were designed to interoperate
with older drivers written against a previous version's DDI. For example, a
game designed for and running on Direct3D 9 with a graphics adapter driver
designed for Direct3D 6 would still work, albeit possibly with gracefully
degraded functionality. However, as of Windows Vista, due to the significantly
updated DDI for Windows Display Driver Model drivers, Direct3D 10 cannot run
on older hardware drivers.

Various releases of Windows have included and supported various versions of
DirectX, allowing newer versions of the operating system to continue running
applications designed for earlier versions of DirectX until those versions can
be gradually phased out in favor of newer APIs, drivers, and hardware.

## [edit] .NET Framework

In 2002 Microsoft released a version of DirectX compatible with the Microsoft
.NET Framework, thus allowing programmers to take advantage of DirectX
functionality from within .NET applications using compatible languages such as
managed C++ or the use of the C# programming language. This API was known as
"Managed DirectX" (or MDX for short), and claimed to operate at 98% of
performance of the underlying native DirectX APIs. In December 2005, February
2006, April 2006, and August 2006, Microsoft released successive updates to
this library, culminating in a beta version called Managed DirectX 2.0. While
Managed DirectX 2.0 consolidated functionality that had previously been
scattered over multiple assemblies into a single assembly, thus simplifying
dependencies on it for software developers, development on this version has
subsequently been discontinued, and it is no longer supported. The Managed
DirectX 2.0 library expired on October 5, 2006.

During the GDC 2006 Microsoft presented the XNA Framework, a new managed
version of DirectX (similar but not identical to Managed DirectX) that is
intended to assist development of games by making it easier to integrate
DirectX, High Level Shader Language (HLSL) and other tools in one package. It
also supports the execution of managed code on the Xbox 360. The XNA Game
Studio Express RTM was made available on December 11, 2006, as a free download
for Windows XP. Unlike the DirectX runtime, Managed DirectX, XNA Framework or
the Xbox 360 APIs (XInput, XACT etc) have not shipped as part of Windows.
Developers are expected to redistribute the runtime components along with
their games or applications.

No Microsoft product including the latest XNA releases provides DirectX 10
support for the .NET Framework.

The other approach for DirectX in managed languages is to use third-party
libraries like SlimDX for Direct3D, DirectInput (including Direct3D 10) and
Direct Show .NET for DirectShow subset.

## [edit] Alternatives

There are alternatives to the DirectX family of APIs, some more complete than
others. While there is no unified solution that will do everything DirectX
does, there are many other options with comparable features: SDL, Allegro,
OpenMAX, OpenML, OpenGL, OpenAL, FMOD, etc. Many of these libraries are cross-
platform or have open codebases.

There are also alternative implementations that aim to provide the same API,
such as the one in Wine.
