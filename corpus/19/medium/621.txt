### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

The version history of iTunes spans from 2001 to present and covers the
application's evolution and refinement from a simple music player to a control
center for many types of media. Support for the iPod and iTunes Store
(originally the iTunes Music Store) were added in the first few versions.
Later, other types of media, including radio, films, television shows, and
audiobooks, were also supported. Most recently, iTunes has branched out from
the iPod and provides iPhone synching capabilities.
