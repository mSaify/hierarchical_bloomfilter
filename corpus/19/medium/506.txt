Rockbox is a free software replacement for the firmware held on various forms
of digital audio players (DAPs). Rockbox offers an alternative to the host
device's operating system firmware (in many cases without removing the
original firmware) which provides a plug-in architecture for adding various
enhancements and functionality to DAPs which are not present in the original
OS. Enhancements include PDA functionality, applications, utilities, and
games. Rockbox can also retrofit video playback functionality onto DAPs first
released in mid-2000. Rockbox also includes a voice-driven user-interface
suitable for operation by blind and visually impaired users.

Rockbox runs on a wide variety of portable audio devices with very different
hardware abilities: from early Archos players with 1-bit character cell-based
displays to modern players with high resolution color displays, digital
optical audio hardware and advanced recording capabilities.

Released under the GNU General Public License, Rockbox is free software.

## [edit] Development

The Rockbox project began in late 2001 and was first implemented on the early
Archos series of hard-disk based MP3 players and player/recorders, including
the flash-only model Ondio, because of owner frustration with severe
limitations in the manufacturer-supplied user interface and device operations.
These devices have relatively weak main CPUs and instead offload music
playback to dedicated hardware MP3 decoding chips (called the MAS). Rockbox,
therefore, was unable to significantly alter playback capabilities. Instead,
it offered a greatly improved user interface and added plugin functionality
not present in the factory firmware. Rockbox is capable of being permanently
flashed into flash memory on the Archos devices, making it a literal firmware
replacement.

Versions of Rockbox have since been produced for more sophisticated devices.
These perform audio decoding in software, allowing Rockbox to potentially
support many more music formats than the original firmware as well as bringing
the extensibility and increased functionality already present in the Archos
ports. Rockbox is run from the hard disk on these devices, after being started
with a custom bootloader, so to upgrade Rockbox users need only copy the files
onto the player's drive and restart the device. Reflashing is only necessary
when changing the bootloader, and on some platforms, is not required at all.

The first of these ports, beginning in late 2004, was for the ColdFire-powered
devices manufactured by iriver, focusing on the H1xx series of hard drive
players (H110/H120/H140). Approximately one year later a port for the H3xx
series became functional, offering similar functionality.

In late 2005, work began on a port of Rockbox to Apple iPod portable players.
Throughout 2006, Rockbox ports were made available for a variety of iPod
models (iPod photo, iPod nano, iPod 4g, iPod mini, and iPod Video), as well as
the Cowon iAUDIO X5 series. As of February 2007, usable ports are also
available for the iriver H10 and Toshiba Gigabeat F & X series. As of March
5th, 2007, a new port for the Cowon iAUDIO M5 became functional. On March
11th, 2007, the SanDisk Sansa e200 series became the next addition to the
Rockbox lineup. On May 23rd, 2007, support for the iPod video 80 GB model was
added, completing the iPod video lineup. On July 27, 2007, initial support was
added for the iPod 1G and 2G. On September 23, 2007, the Sansa c200 series was
welcomed into the lineup. On March 18th, 2008, the Olympus m:robe 100 became
the first new port of 2008, and the iAUDIO M3 joined the lineup days later.
Rockbox now includes video-support for MPEG playback through the included
work-in-progress mpegplayer plugin.[1]

To date, all Rockbox ports have been accomplished by reverse engineering with
little or no manufacturer assistance. However, as free software, many Rockbox
developers and supporters hope to eventually see official manufacturer support
for new ports, or at least unofficial assistance in porting Rockbox to new
devices. To date, only a few companies have expressed interest in Rockbox, and
none have officially contributed code to the project or included it with their
hardware. The Sansa port is the first to be started at the request of the
hardware manufacturer who gave the Rockbox team samples of their devices.

Rockbox is continuously developed, with new SVN builds being released after
every source change.

## [edit] Customization

Subject to the limitations of each particular platform, the appearance of
Rockbox can be customised in various ways. Fonts and foreground and background
colours can be added and selected, while a simple markup language can be used
to create themes for the menu and while-playing screens. These themes can
include background and other images (such as icons), plus various formats for
filenames, ID3 tags, file progress, time and system information. Album art
(though rudimentary -- it does not support embedded album art and only the BMP
file format) has become official as of November 11, 2007.

Rockbox has been essentially a file-tree based player, to which folders could
be dragged and dropped, then navigated by folder structure. More recent
versions, however, have included a database feature which allows the player to
compile information from the files' ID3 tags. The user can then navigate the
files using this database regardless of file structure.  

## [edit] Features

### [edit] Codecs

Rockbox on software decoding platforms (non-Archos) supports playback
(depending on how you count them) of eight lossy codecs, five lossless, two
uncompressed and six miscellaneous formats. This makes a conservative total of
21 supported audio formats, although a few of them do not operate in realtime
on all platforms.

MPEG audio layers I-III (MP3/MP2/MP1), Ogg Vorbis, MPEG-4 AAC, Musepack, AC3,
WMA, Speex, and the lossy portion of WavPack hybrid files are supported lossy
formats. Lossless formats include FLAC, WavPack, Shorten, Apple Lossless and
Monkey's Audio. Rockbox plays Intel-style WAV and Apple AIFF uncompressed
audio. In addition, there are playback of game audio types ADX, SID, NSF, SAP
and SPC. The MOD tracker format is also now supported.[2]

Note that Monkey's Audio support is in the early stages with only the lowest
compression settings playing in realtime on most devices. Also note that any
file with DRM scheme will not play in Rockbox.

### [edit] Rockbox features

Beside the ability of playing and recording audio files, Rockbox offers many
playback enhancements that other firmwares may not have implemented yet.
Listed below are a handful of these features.

  * Gapless playback
  * Crossfading
  * Replay Gain[3]
  * 5 band fully parametric equalizer[3]
  * Crossfeed[3]
  * OTF ("on the fly") playlists
  * True random shuffle (fresh randomly shuffled list every time)
  * Custom UI themes
  * Stereo recording to WAV/AIFF/WavPack (lossless) and MP3[4] (supporting devices)
  * FM radio, including FM recording (supporting devices)
  * Remote control (supporting devices)
  * Digital SPDIF input/output (supporting devices)
  * Last.fm support (even on players lacking RTC)
  * Cue sheet support
  * Changeable selector bar
  * Album art[5]
  * Sleep timer

### [edit] Plug-ins

Rockbox developers can create plug-ins, which provide the user with other
enhancements that may not be available on various firmware modules.

Available plug-ins include:

  * JPEG viewer (16 bit color/129 shade greyscale)[6]
  * Rockboy Game Boy emulator (port of Gnuboy)[7]
  * ZXBox ZX Spectrum emulator (port of Spectemu)[8]
  * Doom (port of the PrBoom engine)
  * WAV to MP3 encoder
  * WAV to WavPack encoder
  * MPEG video player[1]
  * PictureFlow, an album art viewer similar to Apple's Cover Flow
  * Various games including sudoku, solitaire, minesweeper, pong and many others (see http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/PluginIndex for an official list of plugins)
  * MIDI player, realtime on some targets. Requires external instrument set, available on Rockbox page.

### [edit] Unimplemented features

Rockbox development is always ongoing. However, either due to the lack of
support from external companies or platform drawbacks, Rockbox has a few
features which are not yet implemented.

  * Firewire
  * Digital rights management (or Digital Restrictions Management) (intentionally unimplemented)
  * USB host capability ("USB On-The-Go")

## [edit] Architecture

Rockbox uses a simple kernel,[9] with a flat memory model (allowing it to run
on platforms without a memory management unit) and single process. Thin
threads run cooperatively, returning control to a scheduler that prioritizes
the audio thread; the only form of preemption is through interrupts. The
operating system and plugins are written in C, with assembler used for device-
and platform-specific code, in addition to performance sensitive code. The
simple and lightweight architecture allows Rockbox to run on a variety of
targets, with memory ranging from 1 to 64 MB, and CPU speeds ranging 12 to 532
MHz. Rockbox also provides limited support for multicore and asymmetric
multiprocessor systems.
