Apache Struts is an open-source web application framework for developing Java
EE web applications. It uses and extends the Java Servlet API to encourage
developers to adopt a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. It was
originally created by Craig McClanahan and donated to the Apache Foundation in
May, 2000. Formerly located under the Apache Jakarta Project and known as
Jakarta Struts, it became a top level Apache project in 2005.

Struts2 is the rebranding of WebWork under the Apache Struts make.

## [edit] Design goals and overview

In a standard Java EE web application, the client will typically submit
information to the server via a web form. The information is then either
handed over to a Java Servlet which processes it, interacts with a database
and produces an HTML-formatted response, or it is given to a JavaServer Pages
(JSP) document which intermingles HTML and Java code to achieve the same
result. Both approaches are often considered inadequate for large projects
because they mix application logic with presentation and make maintenance
difficult.

The goal of Struts is to cleanly separate the model (application logic that
interacts with a database) from the view (HTML pages presented to the client)
and the controller (instance that passes information between view and model).
Struts provides the controller (a servlet known as `ActionServlet`) and
facilitates the writing of templates for the view or presentation layer
(typically in JSP, but XML/XSLT and Velocity are also supported). The web
application programmer is responsible for writing the model code, and for
creating a central configuration file `struts-config.xml` which binds together
model, view and controller.

Requests from the client are sent to the controller in the form of "Actions"
defined in the configuration file; if the controller receives such a request
it calls the corresponding Action class which interacts with the application-
specific model code. The model code returns an "ActionForward", a string
telling the controller which output page to send to the client. Information is
passed between model and view in the form of special JavaBeans. A powerful
custom tag library allows it to read and write the content of these beans from
the presentation layer without the need for any embedded Java code.

Struts also supports internationalization, provides facilities for the
validation of data submitted by web forms, and includes a template mechanism
called "Tiles" which (for instance) allows the presentation layer to be
composed from independent header, footer, and content components.

## [edit] History

The Apache Struts Project was launched in May 2000 by Craig R. McClanahan to
provide a standard MVC framework to the Java community. In July 2001, version
1.0 was released.

## [edit] Competing MVC frameworks

Although Struts is a well-documented, mature, and popular framework for
building front ends to Java applications, it is facing new challenges from
newer "light weight" MVC frameworks such as Spring MVC, Stripes and Tapestry.
The new XForms standards and frameworks may also be another option to building
complex web Form validations with Struts in the future.

The WebWork framework spun off from Apache Struts several years ago, aiming to
offer enhancements and refinements while retaining the same general
architecture of the original Struts framework. However, it was announced in
December 2005 that Struts would re-merge with WebWork. WebWork 2.2 has been
adopted as Apache Struts2, which reached its first full release in February
2007.

In 2004 Sun launched an addition to the Java platform, called JavaServer Faces
(JSF). Aside from the original Struts framework, the Apache project also
offers a JSF-based framework called Shale.

Other MVC frameworks that are not Java based include Ruby on Rails,
WebObjects, Django, Catalyst, TurboGears, Castle MonoRail for ASP.NET MVC
Framework, CakePHP, Symfony (for PHP), Zend Framework, Achievo ATK,
CodeIgniter (for PHP) and Mach-II (for CFML). Struts4php is a version of the
Struts framework for the PHP web scripting language [1]. Girders is a port of
the Struts framework in C# for Microsoft .NET [2].
