LimeWire is a free peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) client for the Java
platform, which uses the Gnutella network to locate files as well as share
files. It also has limited BitTorrent support. A freeware version and a
purchasable "enhanced" version are available.

## [edit] Features

Written in the Java programming language, LimeWire is able to run on any
computer with Java Virtual Machine installed. Installers are provided for
Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Support for Mac OS 9 and other
previous versions was dropped with the release of LimeWire 4.0.10. From
version 4.8 onwards, LimeWire works as a UPnP Internet Gateway Device
controller in that it can automatically set up packet-forwarding rules with
UPnP-capable routers.

LimeWire offers the sharing of its library through the Digital Audio Access
Protocol (DAAP). As such when LimeWire is running and configured to allow it,
any files shared will be detectable on the local network by DAAP-enabled
devices (e.g., iTunes, Zune).

## [edit] Versions

Lime Wire LLC, the New York City based developer of LimeWire, distributes two
versions of the program; a basic version for free, and an enhanced version,
LimeWire PRO, sold for a fee of $21.95 with 6 months of updates, or $34.95
with 1 year of updates.[1] The company claims the paid version provides faster
downloads and 66% better search results. This is accomplished by facilitating
direct connection with up to 10 hosts of an identical searched file at any one
time, whereas the free version is limited to a maximum of 8 hosts.[2]

Prior to April 2004, the free version of LimeWire was distributed with a
bundled program called LimeShop (a variant of TopMoxie), which was considered
by computer security experts to be spyware.[citation needed] Among other
things, LimeShop monitored online purchases in order to redirect sales
commissions to Lime Wire LLC. Uninstallation of LimeWire would not remove
LimeShop. With the removal of all bundled software in LimeWire 3.9.4 (released
on April 20, 2004), these objections were addressed.[3]

Being free software, LimeWire has spawned forks, including LionShare, an
experimental software development project at Penn State University, and
Acquisition, a Mac OS Xâbased Gnutella client with a proprietary interface.
Researchers at Cornell University developed a reputation management add-in
called Credence that allows users to distinguish between "genuine" and
"suspect" files before downloading them. An October 12, 2005 report states
that some of LimeWire's free and open source software contributors have forked
the project and called it FrostWire.[4] The makers of the LimeWire software
have now installed a security device that can track most viruses in files.

LimeWire was the first file sharing program to support firewall-to-firewall
file transfers, a feature introduced in version 4.2, which was released in
November 2004. LimeWire also now includes BitTorrent support, but is limited
to 3 Torrent uploads and 3 Torrent downloads, which coexist with ordinary
downloads. As of LimeWire 5.0, an instant messenger has been added which uses
the Jabber Protocol, an open source communication protocol. Users can now chat
and share files with individual friends in their buddy list.

## [edit] Criticism

LimeWire has experienced several trials of criticism. According to a June 2005
report in The New York Times, Lime Wire LLC was considering ceasing its
distribution LimeWire because the outcome of MGM v. Grokster "handed a tool to
judges that they can declare inducement whenever they want to."[5]

On September 7, 2007, Gregory Thomas Kopiloff of Seattle was arrested in what
the U.S. Justice Department described as its first case against someone
accused of using file sharing computer programs to commit identity theft.
According to federal prosecutors, Kopiloff used LimeWire to search other
people's computers for inadvertently shared financial information and then
used it to obtain credit cards for an online shopping spree.[6]

A known trojan exploiting a vulnerability involving Apple Remote Desktop
started to be distributed via LimeWire in mid 2008. It affects users of Mac OS
X Tiger and Leopard.[7]

Some criticism focuses on general risks associated with peer-to-peer file
sharing. One investigation showed that of 123 randomly selected downloaded
files, 37 contained malware â about 30%.[8]

## [edit] LimeWire Store

LimeWire now offers a service called LimeWire Store that offers single songs
for $0.99 each as well as subscription plans that discount the per-song cost
as low as $0.27. Video content is available as well but has a limited catalog.
