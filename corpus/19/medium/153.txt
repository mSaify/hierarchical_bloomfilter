## [edit] MediaWiki+FCKeditor

MediaWiki+FCKeditor is a branch of FCKeditor being developed for WYSIWYG wiki
editing.[1] For more info see mw:WYSIWYG editor#FCKeditor.

## [edit] Program Name

The FCK in FCKeditor stands for Frederico Caldeira Knabben, the original
creator of the editor and the project's Benevolent Dictator for Life.
Unfortunately those letters resemble a well-known vulgarity in the English
language (something that Frederico, a native Brazilian, was unaware of when he
first released the program). He has decided to change the program's name to
CKEditor beginning with v3.0 [2]
