### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

Reality distortion field is a term coined by Bud Tribble at Apple Inc. in
1981, to describe company co-founder Steve Jobs' charisma and its effects on
the developers working on the Mac project.[1] Later the term has also been
used to refer to perceptions of his keynote (or Stevenote) by observers and
devoted users of Apple computers and products.[2]

Bud Tribble claimed that the term came from Star Trek.

In essence, RDF is the idea that Steve Jobs is able to convince people to
believe almost anything with a mix of charm, charisma, bluster, exaggeration,
and marketing. RDF is said to distort an audience's sense of proportion or
scale. Small advances are applauded as breakthroughs. Interesting developments
become turning points, or huge leaps forward[citation needed]. Those who use
the term RDF contend that it is not an example of outright deception but more
a case of warping the powers of judgment. The term "audience" may refer to an
individual whose attitudes Steve is intending to affect.

Often the term is used as a derogatory remark to criticize Apple's products
and its more enthusiastic fans.

The term has extended in industry to other managers and leaders, who try to
convince their employees to become passionately committed to projects,
sometimes without regard to the overall product or to competitive forces in
the marketplace. It also has been used with regard to hype for products that
are not necessarily connected with any one person [3].
