ab absurdo from the absurd Said of an argument that seeks to prove a
statement's validity by pointing out the absurdity of an opponent's position
(cf. appeal to ridicule) or that an assertion is false because of its

investigation. In literature, refers to a story told from the beginning rather

commencementâi.e., "originally". The source of the word aboriginal.  
ab ovo usque ad mala from the egg to the apples From Horace, Satire 1.3. Means

an egg dish and ending with fruit (cf. the English phrase soup to nuts). Thus,
ab ovo means "from the beginning", and can also connote thoroughness.

superstitiously believe animosity can cause others. Also extended to absit
invidia verbo, meaning "may ill will be absent from the word" (cf. absit
iniuria verbis).  
absit omen let an omen be absent In other words, "let there not be an omen
here". Expresses the wish that something seemingly ill-boding does not turn

priest as part of the sacrament of Penance (cf. absolvo).  
ego te provoco 'I dare you'  
emeritus 'veteran' Also 'worn-out'. Retired from office. Often used to denote
a position held at the point of retirement, as an honor, such as professor
emeritus or provost emeritus. This does not necessarily mean that the honoree
is no longer active.  
ens causa sui 'existing because of oneself' Or 'being one's own cause'.
Traditionally, a being that owes its existence to no other being, hence God or
a Supreme Being (cf. Primum Mobile).

involves a power to compel sure assent' A phrase used in modern Western

means 'by that very act'; similar to ipso facto. Example: "The fact that I am

are often marked with the plural, errata ('errors').  
esse est percipi 'to be is to be perceived' George Berkeley's motto for his
idealist philosophical position that nothing exists independently of its
perception by a mind except minds themselves.  
esse quam videri 'to be, rather than to seem' Truly being something, rather
than merely seeming to be something. State motto of North Carolina and
academic motto of several schools, including North Carolina State University,
Berklee College of Music, and Columbia College Chicago as well as Connell's
Point Public School and Cranbrook High School in Sydney, Australia. From
chapter 26 of Cicero's De amicitia ('On Friendship'). Earlier than Cicero, the
phrase had been used by Sallust in his Bellum Catilinae (54.6), where he wrote
that Cato esse quam videri bonus malebat ('he preferred to be good, rather
than to seem so'). Earlier still, Aeschylus used a similar phrase in Seven
Against Thebes, line 592, ou gar dokein aristos, all' enai thelei ('his
resolve is not to seem the best, but in fact to be the best').

the end of a list of locations to denote unlisted places.  
et alii (et al.) 'and others' Used similarly to et cetera ('and the rest'), to
stand for a list of names. Alii is actually masculine, so it can be used for
men, or groups of men and women; the feminine, et aliae (or et aliÃ¦), is
appropriate when the 'others' are all female. Et alia is neuter plural and
thus properly used only for inanimate, genderless objects, but some use it as
a gender-neutral alternative.[5] APA style uses et al. if the work cited was
written by more than six authors; MLA style uses et al. for more than three
authors.  
et cetera (etc.) or (&c.) 'And the rest' In modern usages, also used to mean

the following things'), abbreviations: et seqq., et seq.., or sqq.

"Hypothetically..."  
et tu, Brute? 'And you, Brutus?' Also 'Even you, Brutus?' or 'You too,
Brutus?' Used to indicate a betrayal by someone close. From Shakespeare's
Julius Caesar, based on the traditional dying words of Julius Caesar. However,
these were almost certainly not Caesar's true last words; Plutarch quotes
Caesar as saying, in Greek (which was the language of Rome's elite at the
time), ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ïá½º ÏÎ­ÎºÎ½Î¿Î½; (KaÃ¬ sÃ¹ tÃ©knon?), in English 'You as
well, (my) child?', quoting from Menander. Some have speculated based on this
that Brutus was Caesar's child, though there is no substantial evidence of
this.

ex abundantia enim cordis os loquitur 'For out of the abundance of the heart
the mouth speaketh.' From the Gospel according to St. Matthew, XII.xxxiv

ex cathedra 'from the chair' A phrase applied to the declarations or
promulgations of the Pope when, in communion with the college of cardinals,
preserved from the possibility of error by the action of the Holy Ghost (see
Papal Infallibility), he solemnly declares or promulgates ("from the chair"
that was the ancient symbol of the teacher and of the governor, in this case
of the church) a dogmatic teaching on faith or morals as being contained in
divine revelation, or at least being intimately connected to divine
revelation. Used, by extension, of anyone who is perceived as speaking as
though with supreme authority.  
ex Deo 'from God'  
ex dolo malo 'from fraud' 'From harmful deceit'; dolus malus is the Latin
legal term for 'fraud'. The full legal phrase is ex dolo malo non oritur actio

Visu" from their album New Surrender.  
ex mea sententia 'in my opinion'  
ex nihilo nihil fit 'nothing may come from nothing' From Lucretius, and said
earlier by Empedocles. Its original meaning is 'work is required to succeed',
but its modern meaning is a more general 'everything has its origins in
something' (cf. causality). It is commonly applied to the conservation laws in
philosophy and modern science. Ex nihilo often used in conjunction with the
term creation, as in creatio ex nihilo, meaning 'creation, out of nothing'. It
is often used in philosophy or theology in connection with the proposition
that God created the universe from nothing. It is also mentioned in the final
ad-lib of the Monty Python song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.

ex officio 'from the office' By virtue of office or position; 'by right of
office'. Often used when someone holds one position by virtue of holding
another. A common misconception is that ex officio members of a committee or
congress may not vote, but this is not guaranteed by that title.  
ex opere operantis 'from the work of the one working' A theological phrase
contrasted with ex opere operato, referring to the notion that the validity or
promised benefit of a sacrament depends on the person administering it.  
ex opere operato 'from the work worked' A theological phrase meaning that the

baptism actually and literally cleansing one's sins. The Catholic Church
affirms that the source of grace is God, not just the actions or disposition

rule in cases which are not excepted' A juridical motto which means that
exception, as for example during a 'state of exception', does not put in
danger the legitimacy of the rule in its globality. In other words, the
exception is strictly limited to a particular sphere. See also exceptio
strictissimi juris est and exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis.  
exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis 'The exception confirms the
rule in cases which are not excepted' A juridical motto often mistranslated as

(broadly, 'the expression of one thing excludes the implication of something

or "all the world" instead of a specific person. This technical distinction is
important to determine where to file a lawsuit and how to serve a defendant.

to property (in rem), then the action must be filed where the property exists
and is only enforceable there.

seeks jurisdiction over "the premises" rather than "the occupant".

arrangement. In medical contexts, it implies that the condition is still in
the same place and has not worsened, improved, spread, etc. In situ

in vitro in glass An experimental or process methodology performed in a "non-
natural" setting (e.g., in a laboratory using a glass test tube or Petri
dish), and thus outside of a living organism or cell. The reference to glass
is merely an historic one, as the current usage of this term is not specific
to the materials involved, but rather to the "non-natural" setting employed.
Alternative experimental or process methodologies would include in vitro, in
silico, ex vivo and in vivo.  

`In vitro fertilization is not literally done "in glass", but rather is a
technique to fertilize egg cells outside of a woman's body. By definition, it
is thus an ex vivo process.`  
in vivo in life" or "in a living thing An experiment or process performed on a
living specimen.  
in vivo veritas in a living thing [there is] truth An expression used by

ancient world, the ancient Romans practiced pagan rituals, believing it
important to achieve a state of Pax Deorum (Peace of the Gods) instead of Ira
Deorum (Wrath of the Gods): earthquakes, floods, famine, etc.  
ira furor brevis est Wrath (anger) is but a brief madness  
ita vero thus indeed A useful phrase, as the Romans had no word for "yes",
preferring to respond to questions with the affirmative or negative of the
question (i.e., "Are you hungry?" was answered by "I am hungry" or "I am not
hungry", not "Yes" or "No).  
Ite, missa est Go, it is sent" (or, more loosely: "You have been dismissed The

explanation.

res ("thing" or "circumstance"). Often used in e-mail replies. It is a common
misconception that the "Re:" in correspondence is an abbreviation for
regarding or reply; this is not the case. The use of Latin re, in the sense of
"about, concerning", is English usage.  
rebus sic stantibus "with matters standing thus" The doctrine that treaty
obligations hold only as long as the fundamental conditions and expectations
that existed at the time of their creation hold.

reductio ad absurdum "leading back to the absurd" A common debate technique,
and a method of proof in mathematics and philosophy, that proves the thesis by
showing that its opposite is absurd or logically untenable. In general usage
outside mathematics and philosophy, a reductio ad absurdum is a tactic in
which the logic of an argument is challenged by reducing the concept to its
most absurd extreme. Translated from Aristotle's "á¼¡ ÎµÎ¹Ï Î¬ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Î½
Î±ÏÎ±Î³ÏÎ³Î·" (hi eis atopon apagogi, "reduction to the impossible").  
reductio ad infinitum "leading back to the infinite" An argument that creates
an infinite series of causes that does not seem to have a beginning. As a
fallacy, it rests upon Aristotle's notion that all things must have a cause,

unmoved mover. An argument which does not seem to have such a beginning
becomes difficult to imagine.

rerum cognoscere causas "to learn the causes of things" Motto of the
University of Sheffield, the University of Guelph, and London School of
Economics.  
res gestae "things done" A phrase used in law representing the belief that
certain statements are made naturally, spontaneously and without deliberation
during the course of an event, they leave little room for
misunderstanding/misinterpretation upon hearing by someone else ( i.e. by the
witness who will later repeat the statement to the court) and thus the courts
believe that such statements carry a high degree of credibility.  
res ipsa loquitur "the thing speaks for itself" A phrase from the common law
of torts meaning that negligence can be inferred from the fact that such an
accident happened, without proof of exactly how. A clause sometimes
(informally) added on to the end of this phrase is sed quid in infernos dicit
("but what the hell does it say?"), which serves as a reminder that one must
still interpret the significance of events that "speak for themselves".  
res judicata "judged thing" A matter which has been decided by a court. Often
refers to the legal concept that once a matter has been finally decided by the
courts, it cannot be litigated again (cf. non bis in idem and double
jeopardy).  
respice adspice prospice "look behind, look here, look ahead" i.e., "examine
the past, the present and future". Motto of CCNY.

"consider the end". Generally a memento mori, a warning to remember one's
death.  
respondeat superior "let the superior respond" Regarded as a legal maxim in
agency law, referring to the legal liability of the principal with respect to
an employee. Whereas a hired independent contract acting tortiously may not
cause the principal to be legally liable, a hired employee acting tortiously
will cause the principal (the employer) to be legally liable, even if the
employer did nothing wrong.  
restitutio in integrum "restoration to original condition" Principle behind
the awarding of damages in common law negligence claims  
res nullius "nobody's property" Goods without an owner. Used for things or
beings which belong to nobody and are up for grabs, e.g., uninhabited and
uncolonized lands, wandering wild animals, etc. (cf. terra nullius, "no man's
land").

the crest of the Trinity Broadcasting Network of Paul and Jan Crouch.  
rigor mortis "stiffness of death" The rigidity of corpses when chemical
reactions cause the limbs to stiffen about 3â4 hours after death. Other

death") and discoloration (livor mortis, "bluish color of death").  
risum teneatis, amici? "Can you help laughing, friends?" An ironic or rueful
commentary, appended following a fanciful or unbelievable tale.  
Roma invicta "Unconquerable Rome Inspirational motto inscribed on the Statue
of Rome.  
Romanes eunt domus "Romanes go the house" An intentionally garbled Latin
phrase from Monty Python's Life of Brian. Its intended meaning is "Romans, go
home!", but is actually closer to "'People called Romanes they go the house'",
according to a centurion in the movie. When Brian is caught vandalizing the
palace walls with this phrase, rather than punish him, the centurion corrects
his Latin grammar, explaining that Romanus is a second declension noun and has
its plural in -i rather than -es; that ire or eo ("to go") must be in the
imperative mood to denote a command; and that domus takes the accusative case
without a preposition as the object. The final result of this lesson is the
correct Latin phrase Romani ite domum.  
rosa rubicundior lilio candidior omnibus formosior semper in te glorior
"redder than the rose, whiter than the lilies, fairer than all things, I do
ever glory in thee" From the Carmina Burana's song "Si puer cum puellula".  
rus in urbe "A countryside in the city" Generally used to refer to a haven of
peace and quiet within an urban setting, often a garden, but can refer to
interior decoration.

vox populi "voice of the people" Sometimes extended to vox populi vox Dei
("the voice of the people [is] the voice of God"). In its original context,

the source is usually given as the monk Alcuin, who advised Charlemagne that
nec audiendi qui solent dicere vox populi vox Dei quum tumultuositas vulgi
semper insaniae proxima sit, meaning "And those people should not be listened
to who keep saying, 'The voice of the people [is] the voice of God,' since the
riotousness of the crowd is always very close to madness."[21]

  6. ^ Exempli gratia (e.g.) and id est (i.e.) are commonly confused and misused in colloquial English. The former, exempli gratia, means "for example", and is used before giving examples of something ("I have lots of favorite colors, e.g., blue, green, and hot pink"). The latter, id est, means "that is", and is used before clarifying the meaning of something, when elaborating, specifying, or explaining rather than when giving examples ("I have lots of favorite colors; i.e., I can't decide on just one"). In British style, the stops may be omitted: "I have lots of favourite colours, eg blue, green and hot pink". "I have lots of favourite colours; ie I can't decide on just one"
  7. ^ American style guides tend to recommend that "e.g." and "i.e." should generally be followed by a comma, just as "for example" and "that is" would be; UK style tends to omit the comma. See Dictionary.com and their discussion of commas for more information. Search "comma after i.e." for other opinions.
