In psychology, choice blindness is a phenomenon in which subjects fail to
detect conspicuous mismatches between their intended (and expected) choice and
the actual outcome.

Writing in Science, psychologist Petter Johansson and coworkers describe
choice blindness demonstrated in an experiment.

The subject is presented with two cards, on which different (female) faces
appear. The subject is asked to choose which one he finds more attractive. In
the non-manipulated (NM) version, the subject is handed the card that he chose
and asked to say why he chose that one. In the manipulated (M) version, the
experimenter uses sleight of hand techniques to switch the cards without the
subject's knowledge and give the subject the other card.

The workers found that most subjects failed to notice the switch, and
furthermore justified their decision using post-hoc confabulated evidence. For
example, in a M trial, a subject might say "I preferred this one because I
prefer blondes" when he had in fact chosen (and pointed to) the dark-haired
woman, but was handed a blonde.

They point out that his experiment allows one to investigate the relationship
between choice and introspection.

Johansson concludes that he has found that some normal participants
unequivocally produce confabulatory reports when asked to describe the reasons
behind their choices and suggests that choice blindness affords some insight
into the mechanisms behind truthful report.
