For the song by English band The Verve, see Sonnet (song).

The sonnet is one of the poetic forms that can be found in lyric poetry from
Europe. The term "sonnet" derives from the Occitan word sonet and the Italian
word sonetto, both meaning "little song". By the thirteenth century, it had
come to signify a poem of fourteen lines that follows a strict rhyme scheme
and specific structure. The conventions associated with the sonnet have
evolved over its history. The writers of sonnets are sometimes referred to as
"sonneteers," although the term can be used derisively. One of the best-known
sonnet writers is William Shakespeare, who wrote 154 of them. A Shakespearean,
or English sonnet consists of 14 lines, each line contains ten syllables, and
each line is written in iambic pentameter in which a pattern of a non-
emphasized syllable followed by an emphasized syllable is repeated five times.
The rhyme scheme in a Shakespearean sonnet is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG in which the
last two lines are a rhyming couplet.

Traditionally, English poets employ iambic pentameter when writing sonnets. In
the Romance languages, the hendecasyllable and Alexandrine are the most widely
used metres.

## [edit] Italian (Petrarchan) sonnet

The Italian sonnet was created by Giacomo da Lentini, head of the Sicilian
School under Frederick II.[1] Guittone d'Arezzo rediscovered it and brought it
to Tuscany where he adapted it to his language when he founded the Neo-
Sicilian School (1235â1294). He wrote almost 300 sonnets. Other Italian
poets of the time, including Dante Alighieri (1265â1321) and Guido
Cavalcanti (c. 1250â1300) wrote sonnets, but the most famous early sonneteer
was Petrarca (known in English as Petrarch). Other fine examples were written
by Michelangelo.

The Italian sonnets included two parts. First, the octave (two quatrains),
which describe a problem, followed by a sestet (two tercets), which gives the
resolution to it. Typically, the ninth line creates a "turn" or volta which
signals the move from proposition to resolution. Even in sonnets that don't
strictly follow the problem/resolution structure, the ninth line still often
marks a "turn" by signaling a change in the tone, mood, or stance of the poem.

In the sonnets of Giacomo da Lentini, the octave rhymed a-b-a-b, a-b-a-b;
later, the a-b-b-a, a-b-b-a pattern became the standard for Italian sonnets.
For the sestet there were two different possibilities, c-d-e-c-d-e and c-d-c-
c-d-c. In time, other variants on this rhyming scheme were introduced such as
c-d-c-d-c-d.

The first known sonnets in English, written by Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry
Howard, Earl of Surrey, used this Italian scheme, as did sonnets by later
English poets including John Milton, Thomas Gray, William Wordsworth and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Early twentieth-century American poet Edna St.
Vincent Millay also wrote most of her sonnets using the Italian form.

This example, On His Blindness by Milton, gives a sense of the Italian rhyming
scheme;

When I consider how my light is spent (a)  
Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide, (b)  
And that one talent which is death to hide, (b)  
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent (a)  
To serve therewith my Maker, and present (a)  
My true account, lest he returning chide; (b)  
"Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?" (b)  
I fondly ask; but Patience to prevent (a)  
That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need (c)  
Either man's work or his own gifts; who best (d)  
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state (e)  
Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed (c)  
And post o'er land and ocean without rest; (d)  
They also serve who only stand and wait." (e)

## [edit] Occitan sonnet

The sole confirmed surviving sonnet in the Occitan language is confidently
dated to 1284, and is conserved only in troubadour manuscript P, an Italian
chansonnier of 1310, now XLI.42 in the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence.[2]
It was written by Paolo Lanfranchi da Pistoia and is addressed to Peter III of
Aragon. This poem is historically interesting for its information on north
Italian perspectives concerning the War of the Sicilian Vespers, the conflict
between the Angevins and Aragonese for Sicily.[2] Peter III and the Aragonese
cause was popular in northern Italy at the time and Paolo's sonnet is a
celebration of his victory over the Angevins and Capetians in the Aragonese
Crusade:

     Valenz Senher, rei dels Aragones
    a qi prez es honors tut iorn enansa,
    remembre vus, Senher, del Rei franzes
    qe vus venc a vezer e laiset Fransa
     Ab dos sos fillz es ab aqel d'Artes;
    hanc no fes colp d'espaza ni de lansa
    e mainz baros menet de lur paes:
    jorn de lur vida said n'auran menbransa.
     Nostre Senhier faccia a vus compagna
    per qe en ren no vus qal[la] duptar;
    tals quida hom qe perda qe gazaingna.
     Seigner es de la terra e de la mar,
    per qe lo Rei Engles e sel d'Espangna
    ne varran mais, si.ls vorres aiudar.
     Valiant Lord, king of the Aragonese
    to whom honour grows every day closer,
    remember, Lord, the French king[3]
    that has come to find you and has left France
     With his two sons[4] and that one of Artois;[5]
    but they have not dealt a blow with sword or lance
    and many barons have left their country:
    but a day will come when they will have some to remember.
     Our Lord make yourself a company
    in order that you might fear nothing;
    that one who would appear to lose might win.
     Lord of the land and the sea,
    as whom the king of England[6] and that of Spain[7]
    are not worth as much, if you wish to help them.  
An Occitan sonnet, dated to 1321 and assigned to one "William of Almarichi",
is found in Jean de Nostredame and cited in Giovanni Crescembeni, Storia della
volgar Poesia. It congratulates Robert of Naples on his recent victory. Its
authenticity is dubious. There are also two poorly-regarded sonnets by the
Italian Dante de Maiano.

English sonnets were introduced by Thomas Wyatt in the early 16th century. His
sonnets and those of his contemporary the Earl of Surrey were chiefly
translations from the Italian of Petrarch and the French of Ronsard and
others. While Wyatt introduced the sonnet into English, it was Surrey who gave
them the rhyming meter, and division into quatrains that now characterizes the
English sonnet. Having previously circulated in manuscript, both poets'
sonnets were first published in Richard Tottel's Songes and Sonnetts, better
known as Tottel's Miscellany (1557).

It was, however, Sir Philip Sidney's sequence Astrophel and Stella (1591) that
started the English vogue for sonnet sequences: the next two decades saw
sonnet sequences by William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, Michael Drayton,
Samuel Daniel, Fulke Greville, William Drummond of Hawthornden, and many
others. These sonnets were all essentially inspired by the Petrarchan
tradition, and generally treat of the poet's love for some woman; the
exception is Shakespeare's sequence. In the 17th century, the sonnet was
adapted to other purposes, with John Donne and George Herbert writing
religious sonnets, and John Milton using the sonnet as a general meditative
poem. Both the Shakespearean and Petrarchan rhyme schemes were popular
throughout this period, as well as many variants.

The fashion for the sonnet went out with the Restoration, and hardly any
sonnets were written between 1670 and Wordsworth's time. However, sonnets came
back strongly with the French Revolution. Wordsworth himself wrote several
sonnets, of which the best-known are "The world is too much with us" and the
sonnet to Milton; his sonnets were essentially modelled on Milton's. Keats and
Shelley also wrote major sonnets; Keats's sonnets used formal and rhetorical
patterns inspired partly by Shakespeare, and Shelley innovated radically,
creating his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet "Ozymandias". Sonnets were
written throughout the 19th century, but, apart from Elizabeth Barrett
Browning's Sonnets from the Portuguese and the sonnets of Dante Gabriel
Rossetti, there were few very successful traditional sonnets. Gerard Manley
Hopkins wrote several major sonnets, often in sprung rhythm, of which the
greatest is "The Windhover," and also several sonnet variants such as the
10Â½-line curtal sonnet "Pied Beauty" and the 24-line caudate sonnet "That
Nature is a Heraclitean Fire." By the end of the 19th century, the sonnet had
been adapted into a general-purpose form of great flexibility.

This flexibility was extended even further in the 20th century. Among the
major poets of the early Modernist period, Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent
Millay and E. E. Cummings all used the sonnet regularly. William Butler Yeats
wrote the major sonnet Leda and the Swan, which used half rhymes. Wilfred
Owen's sonnet Anthem for Doomed Youth was another sonnet of the early 20th
century. W. H. Auden wrote two sonnet sequences and several other sonnets
throughout his career, and widened the range of rhyme-schemes used
considerably. Auden also wrote one of the first unrhymed sonnets in English,
"The Secret Agent" (1928). Half-rhymed, unrhymed, and even unmetrical sonnets
have been very popular since 1950; perhaps the best works in the genre are
Seamus Heaney's Glanmore Sonnets and Clearances, both of which use half
rhymes, and Geoffrey Hill's mid-period sequence 'An Apology for the Revival of
Christian Architecture in England'. The 1990s saw something of a formalist
revival, however, and several traditional sonnets have been written in the
past decade.

Soon after the introduction of the Italian sonnet, English poets began to
develop a fully native form. These poets included Sir Philip Sidney, Michael
Drayton, Samuel Daniel, the Earl of Surrey's nephew Edward de Vere, 17th Earl
of Oxford and William Shakespeare. The form is often named after Shakespeare,
not because he was the first to write in this form but because he became its
most famous practitioner. The form consists of fourteen lines structured as
three quatrains and a couplet. The third quatrain generally introduces an
unexpected sharp thematic or imagistic "turn" called a volta. In Shakespeare's
sonnets, the couplet usually summarizes the theme of the poem or introduces a
fresh new look at the theme. The usual meter is iambic pentameter, which means
five iambic feet, i.e., ten-syllable lines in which even-numbered syllables
are naturally accentedâalthough few English sonnets do not take liberties
with these formal constraints (e.g., lines ending with an extra-syllable
feminine rhyme, or a trochee at the beginning of a line rather than an iamb).
The usual rhyme scheme is end-rhymed a-b-a-b, c-d-c-d, e-f-e-f, g-g.

This example, Shakespeare's Sonnet 116, illustrates the form (with some
typical variances one may expect when reading an Elizabethan-age sonnet with
modern eyes):

Let me not to the marriage of true minds (a)  
Admit impediments, love is not love (b)*  
Which alters when it alteration finds, (a)  
Or bends with the remover to remove. (b)*  
O no, it is an ever fixed mark (c)**  
That looks on tempests and is never shaken; (d)***  
It is the star to every wand'ring bark, (c)  
Whose worth's unknown although his height be taken. (d)***  
Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks (e)  
Within his bending sickle's compass come, (f)*  
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, (e)  
But bears it out even to the edge of doom: (f)*  
If this be error and upon me proved, (g)*  
I never writ, nor no man ever loved. (g)*

>  *** RHYME/METER: Feminine-rhyme-ending, eleven-syllable alternative.

The Prologue to Romeo and Juliet is also a sonnet, as is Romeo and Juliet's
first exchange in Act One, Scene Five, lines 104-117, beginning with "If I
profane with my unworthiest hand" (104) and ending with "Then move not while
my prayer's effect I take." (117).[8]

## [edit] Spenserian sonnet

A variant on the English form is the Spenserian sonnet, named after Edmund
Spenser (c.1552â1599) in which the rhyme scheme is, abab, bcbc, cdcd, ee. In
a Spenserian sonnet there does not appear to be a requirement that the initial
octave set up a problem that the closing sestet answers, as is the case with a
Petrarchan sonnet. Instead, the form is treated as three quatrains connected
by the interlocking rhyme scheme and followed by a couplet. The linked rhymes
of his quatrains suggest the linked rhymes of such Italian forms as terza
rima. This example is taken from Amoretti.

Happy ye leaves! when those lily hands  
  
Happy ye leaves! when those lily hands, (a)  
Which hold my life in their dead doing might, (b)  
Shall handle you, and hold in love's soft bands, (a)  
Like captives trembling at the victor's sight. (b)  
And happy lines on which, with starry light, (b)  
Those lamping eyes will deign sometimes to look,(c)  
And read the sorrows of my dying sprite, (b)  
Written with tears in heart's close bleeding book. (c)  
And happy rhymes! bathed in the sacred brook (c)  
Of Helicon, whence she derived is, (d)  
When ye behold that angel's blessed look, (c)  
My soul's long lacked food, my heaven's bliss. (d)  
Leaves, lines, and rhymes seek her to please alone, (e)  
Whom if ye please, I care for other none. (e)

## [edit] Modern sonnet

With the advent of free verse, the sonnet came to be seen as somewhat old-
fashioned and fell out of use for a time among some schools of poets. However,
a number of 20th-century poets, including Wilfred Owen, John Berryman, Edwin
Morgan, Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay, E.E. Cummings, Jorge Luis
Borges, Pablo Neruda, Joan Brossa, Vikram Seth, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Seamus
Heaney continued to use the form. The advent of the New Formalism movement in
the United States has also contributed to contemporary interest in the sonnet.
