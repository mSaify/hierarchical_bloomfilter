Cedalion standing on the shoulders of Orion from Blind Orion Searching for the
Rising Sun by Nicolas Poussin, 1658, Oil on canvas; 46 7/8 x 72 in. (119.1 x
182.9 cm), Metropolitan Museum of Art

Dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants (Latin: nanos gigantum humeris
insidentes) is a Western metaphor meaning "One who develops future
intellectual pursuits by understanding the research and works created by
notable thinkers of the past"; a contemporary interpretation. However, the
metaphor was first recorded in the twelfth century and attributed to Bernard
of Chartres. It was famously used by the seventeenth-century scientist Isaac
Newton who wrote it as: Pigmaei gigantum humeris impositi plusquam ipsi
gigantes vident (see below). The picture is derived from the Greek mythology
where the blind giant Orion carried his servant Cedalion on his shoulders.

## [edit] Attribution and meaning

The attribution to Bernard is due to John of Salisbury. In 1159, John wrote in
his Metalogicon:[citation needed]

    "Bernard of Chartres used to say that we are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size."
    ("Dicebat Bernardus Carnotensis nos esse quasi nanos, gigantium humeris insidentes, ut possimus plura eis et remotiora videre, non utique proprii visus acumine, aut eminentia corporis, sed quia in altum subvenimur et extollimur magnitudine gigantea")
According to medieval historian Richard Southern, Bernard is comparing the
modern scholar (12th century) to the ancient scholars of Greece and Rome:[1]

    [The phrase] sums up the quality of the cathedral schools in the history of learning, and indeed characterizes the age which opened with Gerbert (950-1003) and Fulbert (960-1028) and closed in the first quarter of the 12th century with Peter Abelard. [The phrase] is not a great claim; neither, however, is it an example of abasement before the shrine of antiquity. It is a very shrewd and just remark, and the important and original point was the dwarf could see a little further than the giant. That this was possible was above all due to the cathedral schools with their lack of a well-rooted tradition and their freedom from a clearly defined routine of study.
The phrase also appears in the works of the Jewish tosaphist Isaiah di Trani
(c. 1180 â c. 1250):[2]

    "Should Joshua the son of Nun endorse a mistaken position, I would reject it out of hand, I do not hesitate to express my opinion, regarding such mattersm in accordance with the modicum of intelligence alloted to me. I was never arrogant claiming "My Wisdom served me well". Instead I applied to myself the parable of the philosophers. For I heard the following from the philosophers, The wisest of the philosophers asked: "We admit that our predecessors were wiser than we. At the same time we criticize their comments, often rejecting them and claiming that the truth rests with us. How is this possible?" The wise philosopher responded: "Who sees further a dwarf or a giant? Surely a giant for his eyes are situated at a higher level than those of the dwarf. But if the dwarf is placed on the shoulders of the giant who sees further? ... So too we are dwarfs astride the shoulders of giants. We master their wisdom and move beyond it. Due their wisdom we grow wise and are able to say all that we say, but not because we are greater than they"
(The main 16th century entry is absurd, given the 12th century attributions
immediately following. It is still used today without the dwarf context. The
usual study in mediocrity, added to, but uncorrected in the main.)

Didacus Stella took up the quote in the sixteenth century; by the seventeenth
century it had become commonplace. Robert Burton, in The Anatomy of Melancholy
(1621-51), quotes Didacus Stella thus:

    "I say with Didacus Stella, a dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a giant himself."
Later editors of Burton misattributed the quote to Lucan; in their hands
Burton's attribution Didacus Stella, in luc 10, tom. ii "Didacus on the Gospel
of Luke, chapter 10; volume 2" became a reference to Lucan's Pharsalia 2.10.
No reference or allusion to the quote is found there.

Later in the seventeenth century, George Herbert, in his Jacula Prudentum
(1651), wrote "A dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two" and
Isaac Newton famously remarked in a letter to his rival Robert Hooke dated
February 5, 1676 that:

    "What Descartes did was a good step. You have added much several ways, and especially in taking the colours of thin plates into philosophical consideration. If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."
This has recently been interpreted by a few writers as a sarcastic remark
directed against Hooke. This is speculative; Hooke and Newton had exchanged
many letters in tones of mutual regard, and Hooke was not of particularly
short stature, although he was of slight build and had been afflicted from his
youth with a severe stoop. However, at some point, when Robert Hooke
criticized some of Newton's ideas regarding optics, Newton was so offended
that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until
Hooke's death.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in The Friend (1828), wrote:

    "The dwarf sees farther than the giant, when he has the giant's shoulder to mount on."
Against this notion, Friedrich Nietzsche argues that a dwarf (the academic
scholar) brings even the most sublime heights down to his level of
understanding. In the section of Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1882) entitled "On
the Vision and the Riddle", Zarathustra climbs to great heights with a dwarf
on his shoulders to show him his greatest thought. Once there however, the
dwarf fails to understand the profundity of the vision and Zarathustra
reproaches him for "making things too easy on [him]self." If there is to be
anything resembling "progress" in the history of philosophy, Nietzsche
elsewhere[specify] writes, it can only come from those rare giants among men,
shouting out to one another across the annals of time.
