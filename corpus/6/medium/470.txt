Civil Disobedience (Resistance to Civil Government) is an essay by Henry David
Thoreau that was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not
permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people
have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to
make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his
disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War.

## [edit] Title

In 1848, Thoreau gave lectures at the Concord Lyceum that he titled âThe
Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government.â[1] This
formed the basis for his essay, which was first published under the title
Resistance to Civil Government in 1849 in a magazine called Ãsthetic Papers.

That title was a way of distinguishing Thoreauâs program from that of the
ânon-resistantsâ (anarcho-pacifists) who were expressing similar views.
âResistanceâ also served as part of Thoreauâs metaphor which compared
the government to a machine, and said that when the machine was working
injustice it was the duty of conscientious citizens to be âa counter
frictionâ â that is, a resistance â âto stop the machine.â[2]

In 1866, four years after Thoreauâs death, the essay was reprinted in a
collection of Thoreauâs work (A Yankee in Canada, with Anti-Slavery and
Reform Papers) under the title Civil Disobedience, by which it is most
popularly known today.

Today, the essay is also frequently seen under the title On the Duty of Civil
Disobedience, perhaps to contrast it with William Paleyâs Of the Duty of
Civil Obedience to which Thoreau was in part responding. For instance, the
1960 New American Library Signet Classics edition of Walden included a version
with this title. On Civil Disobedience is another frequently-encountered
title.

The word âcivilâ has several definitions (see: Wiktionary: âcivilâ).
The one that is intended in this case is ârelating to citizens and their
interrelations with one another or with the state,â and so âcivil
disobedienceâ means âdisobedience to the state.â Sometimes people assume
that âcivilâ in this case means âobserving accepted social forms;
politeâ which would make âcivil disobedienceâ something like âpolite,
orderly disobedience.â Although this is an acceptable dictionary definition
of the word âcivil,â it is not what is intended here. This
misinterpretation is one reason the essay is sometimes considered to be an
argument for pacifism or for exclusively nonviolent resistance. For instance,
Gandhi used this interpretation to suggest an equivalence between Thoreauâs
civil disobedience and his own satyagraha.[3]

## [edit] âThat government is best which governs leastâ

An aphorism attributed to either Thomas Jefferson or Thomas PaineââThat
government is best which governs leastââactually was first found in this
essay.[4] Thoreau was paraphrasing the motto of The United States Magazine and
Democratic Review: âThe best government is that which governs least.â[5]

## [edit] Summary

Thoreau asserts that because governments are typically more harmful than
helpful, they therefore cannot be justified. Democracy is no cure for this, as
majorities simply by virtue of being majorities do not also gain the virtues
of wisdom and justice. The judgment of an individualâs conscience is not
necessarily or even likely inferior to the decisions of a political body or
majority, and so â[i]t is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law,
so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume
is to do at any time what I think right.â¦ Law never made men a whit more
just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily
made the agents of injustice.â[6]

Indeed, he points out, you serve your country poorly if you do so by
suppressing your conscience in favor of the law because your country needs
consciences more than it needs conscienceless robots.

Thoreau says that it is disgraceful to be associated with the United States
government in particular: âI cannot for an instant recognize as my
government [that] which is the slaveâs government also.â[7]

The government, according to Thoreau, is not just a little corrupt or unjust
in the course of doing its otherwise-important work, but in fact the
government is primarily an agent of corruption and injustice. Because of this,
itâs ânot too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize.â[8]

Political philosophers have counseled caution about revolution because the
upheaval of revolution typically causes a lot of expense and suffering.
However, Thoreau says that such a cost/benefit analysis isnât appropriate
when the government is actively facilitating an injustice like slavery. Such a
thing is fundamentally immoral and even if it would be difficult and expensive
to stop it, it must be stopped because it is wrong. âThis people must cease
to hold slaves, and to make war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence
as a people.â[9]

Thoreau tells his audience that they cannot blame this problem solely on pro-
slavery Southern politicians, but must put the blame on those in, for
instance, Massachusetts, âwho are more interested in commerce and
agriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do justice to
the slave and to Mexico, cost what it may.â¦ There are thousands who are in
opinion opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do nothing to put
an end to them.â[10] (See also: Thoreauâs âSlavery in Massachusettsâ
which also advances this argument.)

He exhorts people not to just wait passively for an opportunity to vote for
justice, because voting for justice is as ineffective as wishing for justice;
what you need to do is to actually be just. This is not to say that you have
an obligation to devote your life to fighting for justice, but you do have an
obligation not to commit injustice and not to give injustice your practical
support.

Paying taxes is one way in which otherwise well-meaning people collaborate in
injustice. People who proclaim that the war in Mexico is wrong and that it is
wrong to enforce slavery contradict themselves if they fund both things by
paying taxes. Thoreau points out that the same people who applaud soldiers for
refusing to fight an unjust war are not themselves willing to refuse to fund
the government that started the war.

In a constitutional republic like the United States, people often think that
the proper response to an unjust law is to try to use the political process to
change the law, but to obey and respect the law until it is changed. But if
the law is itself clearly unjust, and the lawmaking process is not designed to
quickly obliterate such unjust laws, then Thoreau says the law deserves no
respect and it should be broken. In the case of the United States the
Constitution itself enshrines the institution of slavery, and therefore falls
under this condemnation. Abolitionists, in Thoreau's opinion, should
completely withdraw their support of the government and stop paying taxes,
even if this means courting imprisonment.

    âUnder a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.â¦ where the State places those who are not with her, but against her, â the only house in a slave State in which a free man can abide with honor.â¦ Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence. A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.â[11]
Because the government will retaliate, Thoreau says he prefers living simply
because he therefore has less to lose. âI can afford to refuse allegiance to
Massachusettsâ¦. It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of
disobedience to the State than it would to obey. I should feel as if I were
worth less in that case.â[12]

He was briefly imprisoned for refusing to pay the poll tax, but even in jail
felt freer than the people outside. He considered it an interesting experience
and came out of it with a new perspective on his relationship to the
government and its citizens. (He was released the next day when "someone
interfered, and paid that tax.")[13]

Thoreau said he was willing to pay the highway tax, which went to pay for
something of benefit to his neighbors, but that he was opposed to taxes that
went to support the government itself â even if he could not tell if his
particular contribution would eventually be spent on an unjust project or a
beneficial one. âI simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to
withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually.â[14]

Because government is man-made, not an element of nature or an act of God,
Thoreau hoped that its makers could be reasoned with. As governments go, he
felt, the U.S. government, with all its faults, was not the worst and even had
some admirable qualities. But he felt we could and should insist on better.
âThe progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy, from a limited
monarchy to a democracy, is a progress toward a true respect for the
individual.â¦ Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement
possible in government? Is it not possible to take a step further towards
recognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a really
free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual
as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority
are derived, and treats him accordingly.â[15]

## [edit] Influence

### [edit] Mohandas Gandhi

Main article: Civil disobedience movement

Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi was very impressed by Thoreauâs
arguments. In 1907, about one year into his first satyagraha campaign in South
Africa, he wrote a translated synopsis of Thoreauâs argument for Indian
Opinion, credited Thoreauâs essay with being âthe chief cause of the
abolition of slavery in Americaâ, and wrote that âBoth his example and
writings are at present exactly applicable to the Indians in the
Transvaal.â[16] He later concluded:

> Thoreau was a great writer, philosopher, poet, and withal a most practical
man, that is, he taught nothing he was not prepared to practice in himself. He
was one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced. At the time
of the abolition of slavery movement, he wrote his famous essay âOn the Duty
of Civil Disobedienceâ. He went to gaol for the sake of his principles and
suffering humanity. His essay has, therefore, been sanctified by suffering.
Moreover, it is written for all time. Its incisive logic is unanswerable.[17]

### [edit] Martin Luther King, Jr.

American civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. was also influenced by
this essay. In his autobiography, he wrote:

> During my student days I read Henry David Thoreauâs essay On Civil
Disobedience for the first time. Here, in this courageous New Englander's
refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that
would spread slaveryâs territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with
the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to
cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work
several times.

> I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral
obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent
and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a
result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of
creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights
movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a
sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest
in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths
of Thoreauâs insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can
patiently adjust to injustice.[18]

### [edit] Martin Buber

Existentialist Martin Buber wrote, of Civil Disobedience

> I read it with the strong feeling that here was something that concerned me
directly.â¦ It was the concrete, the personal element, the âhere and nowâ
of this work that won me over. Thoreau did not put forth a general proposition
as such; he described and established his attitude in a specific historical-
biographic situation. He addressed his reader within the very sphere of this
situation common to both of them in such a way that the reader not only
discovered why Thoreau acted as he did at that time but also that the reader
â assuming him of course to be honest and dispassionate â would have to
act in just such a way whenever the proper occasion arose, provided he was
seriously engaged in fulfilling his existence as a human person.

> The question here is not just about one of the numerous individual cases in
the struggle between a truth powerless to act and a power that has become the
enemy of truth. It is really a question of the absolutely concrete
demonstration of the point at which this struggle at any moment becomes
manâs duty as man.â¦[19]
