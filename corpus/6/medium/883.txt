## [edit] Jewish messiah claimants

    Main article: Jewish messianic claimants. Note that for messiahs lacking articles, there may be more detail there.
The Jewish Messiah originally meant a divinely appointed king; David, Cyrus
the Great, and Alexander the Great[1] are examples of such. Later, especially
after the failure of Bar Kokhba's revolt, the figure of the messiah was one
who would deliver the Jews from oppression and usher in a new world.

    * Mordecai Mokia (1650-1729), "the Rebuker," another person who proclaimed himself Messiah after Sabbatai's death.
    * LÃ¶bele Prossnitz (?-1750), a proven fraud who nevertheless attained some following amongst former followers of Sabbatai, calling himself the "Messiah ben Joseph."
  * Jacob Joseph Frank (1726-1791), who claimed to be the reincarnation of King David and preached a synthesis of Christianity and Judaism.
  * Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902-1994), a Chabad Rabbi who tried to "prepare the way" for the Messiah. Despite much controversy, most of his followers believed him to be the Messiah, many still do.

But Felix, the procurator (c. 55-60), met the throng with his soldiery. The prophet escaped, but those with him were killed or taken, and the multitude dispersed (ib. xx. 8, Â§ 6; "B.
