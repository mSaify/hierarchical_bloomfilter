Dutch Book of Prayers from the mid-fifteenth century. Group of five saints.
From left to right, Saint Joseph, Saint James the Great, Saint Eligius, Saint
Hermes, and Saint Ghislain, with their emblems.

Christianity has used symbolism from its very beginnings.[1] Each saint has a
story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used
to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of
Christian saints are traditionally represented by a symbol or iconic motif
associated with their life, termed an attribute or emblem, in order to
identify them. The study of these forms part of iconography in Art history.
They were particularly used so that the illiterate could recognize a scene,
and to give each of the saints something of a personality in art. They are
often carried in the hand by the saint. Attributes often vary with either time
or geography, especially between Eastern Christianity and the West. Orthodox
images more often contained inscriptions with the names of saints, so the
Eastern repertoire of attributes is generally smaller than the Western. Many
of the most prominent saints, like Saint Peter and Saint John the Evangelist
can also be recognised by a distinctive facial type - as of course can Christ.
In the case of later saints their actual historical appearance can also be
used. Some attributes are general, like the palm frond carried by martyrs.

The use of a symbol in a work of art depicting a saint reminds people who is
being shown and of their story. The following is a list of some of these
attributes.
