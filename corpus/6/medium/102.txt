The Glass Bead Game (German: Das Glasperlenspiel) is the last work and magnum
opus of the German author Hermann Hesse. Begun in 1931 and published in
Switzerland in 1943, the book was mentioned in Hesse's citation for the 1946
Nobel Prize for Literature.

"Glass Bead Game" is a literal translation of the German title. The title has
also been rendered as Magister Ludi. "Magister Ludi", Latin for "master of the
game," is the name of an honorific title awarded to the book's central
character. "Magister Ludi" can also be seen as a pun: lud- is a Latin stem
meaning both "game" and "school."

## [edit] Plot summary

The Glass Bead Game takes place at an unspecified date, centuries into the
future. Hesse suggested that he imagined the book's narrator writing around
the start of the 25th century[1]. The setting is a fictional province of
central Europe called Castalia, reserved by political decision for the life of
the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum. Castalia
is home to an austere order of intellectuals with a twofold mission: to run
boarding schools for boys (the novel is thus a detailed exploration of
education and the life of the mind), and to nurture and play the Glass Bead
Game.

The novel follows the life of a distinguished member of the order, Joseph
Knecht (the surname translates as "servant" or "farm hand" but can also mean
"vassal" or "knight"), as narrated by a fictional historian of the order.
Hence the novel is an example of a Bildungsroman. The text, written in a
scholarly biographical style, chronicles the precocious protagonist's decision
to join the order, his mastery of the Game, and his advancing in the order's
hierarchy, eventually being given the title Magister Ludi, reserved for the
Game's finest player.[2]

However, Knecht's loyalty to the order is brought into question as he
gradually comes to doubt whether the intellectually gifted have a right to
withdraw from life's big problems. Knecht comes to see Castalia as a kind of
ivory tower, an ethereal protected community, devoted to pure intellectual
pursuits, but oblivious to the problems posed by life outside its borders.
This conclusion precipitates a personal crisis, and accordingly, Knecht does
the unthinkable: he resigns as Magister Ludi and asks to leave the order,
ostensibly to become of value and service, in some way, to the larger culture.
The heads of the order deny his request to leave, but Knecht departs Castalia
anyway, initially taking a job as a tutor to his childhood friend's son. Only
a few days later, he drowns in a mountain lake while attempting a swim for
which he was not fit. The story ends abruptly.

The narrator breaks off before the final sections of the book, remarking that
the end of the story is beyond the scope of his biography. The concluding
chapter, entitled "The Legend", is reportedly from a different biography.
After this final chapter, several of Knecht's "posthumous" works are then
presented. The first section contains Knecht's poetry from various periods of
his life. Then three short stories follow. The first tells of an ancient pagan
named Knecht; the second of Josephus, an early Christian hermit; and the final
story covers the life of Dasa, an Indian prince who grows up as a cowherd. All
three stories cover the lives of spiritual seekers who learn the mystic
traditions of their respective eras from sagacious teachers. Originally, Hesse
intended several different lives of the same person as he is reincarnated[3].
Instead, he focused on a story set in the future and placed the three shorter
stories, "authored" by Knecht in The Glass Bead Game at the end of the novel.

## [edit] Allusions in the novel

Many characters in the novel have names that are allusive word games. For
example, Knecht's predecessor as Magister Ludi was Thomas van der Trave, a
veiled reference to Thomas Mann who was born in LÃ¼beck, situated on the Trave
River. Knecht's brilliant but unstable friend Fritz Tegularius is based on
Friedrich Nietzsche, while Father Jacobus is based on the historian Jakob
Burckhardt.[4] The name of Carlo Ferromonte is an italianized version of the
name of Hesse's nephew, Karl Isenberg, while the name of the Glass Bead Game's
inventor, Bastian Perrot of Calw, was taken from the owner of a machine shop
where Hesse once worked after dropping out of school, named Heinrich
Perrot.[4]
