"In Flanders Fields" is one of the most famous poems written during World War
I and has been called "the most popular poem" produced during that period.[1]
It is written in the form of a French rondeau. Canadian physician and
Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae wrote it on May 3, 1915, after he witnessed the
death of his friend, Lieutenant Alexis Helmer, only 22 years old, the day
before. The poem was first published on December 8 of that year in the London-
based magazine Punch.

## [edit] Historical context

The poppies referred to in the poem grew in profusion in Flanders where war
casualties had been buried and thus became a symbol of Remembrance Day. The
poem is part of Remembrance Day solemnities in Allied countries which
contributed troops to World War I, particularly in countries of the British
Empire that did so.

The poem "In Flanders Fields" was written after John McCrae witnessed the
death, and presided over the funeral, of a friend, Lieut. Alexis Helmer. By
most accounts it was written in his notebook [2] and later rejected by McCrae.
Ripped out of his notebook, it was rescued by a fellow officer and later
published in Punch magazine.

> In Flanders fields the poppies blow  
>  Between the crosses, row on row,  
>  That mark our place; and in the sky  
>  The larks, still bravely singing, fly  
>  Scarce heard amid the guns below.

> We are the dead. Short days ago  
>  We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,  
>  Loved, and were loved, and now we lie  
>  In Flanders fields.

> Take up our quarrel with the foe:  
>  To you from failing hands we throw  
>  The torch; be yours to hold it high.  
>  If ye break faith with us who die  
>  We shall not sleep, though poppies grow  
>  In Flanders fields.

> â Lt.-Col. John McCrae (1872 - 1918)

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

The poem has achieved near-mythic status in contemporary Canada and is one of
the nation's most prominent symbols. Most Remembrance Day ceremonies will
feature a reading of the poem in some form (it is also sung a cappella in some
places), and many Canadian schoolchildren memorize the verse. The third stanza
is often omitted, particularly when the poem is used in schools, thus removing
the more "warlike" elements of the poem (see "Criticism", below).[citation
needed]

The poem is now also a common part of Remembrance Day ceremonies in the United
Kingdom, where it holds as one of the nation's best-loved.

A portion of the poem is now printed on Canadian $10 notes, where it spawned a
false rumour that the poem had been misprinted, resulting from popular
confusion between the first line's "blow" and the penultimate line's "grow."
The use of "grow" in the first line is, however, an authentic variation. It
appears in at least one autograph (see In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems),
and schools in Guelph (McCrae's birthplace) once taught that "the poppies
grow" could refer to spreading blood stains on the shallow graves.

## [edit] Criticisms

Critic Paul Fussell, in The Great War and Modern Memory, points out the sharp
distinctions between the pastoral, sacrificial tone of the poem's first nine
lines and the "recruiting-poster rhetoric" of the poem's third stanza; he
argues that, appearing in 1915, the poem would serve to denigrate any
negotiated peace that would end the war, and calls these lines "a propaganda
argument," saying "words like vicious and stupid would not seem to go too
far."[3] Modern public readings of the poem, however, stress the debt to the
dead and the necessity to honour their memory in ceremonies often focusing on
the sacrifice and sorrow of war.

## [edit] Other versions

An official adaptation into French, used by the Canadian government in
Remembrance Day ceremonies, was written by Jean Pariseau and is entitled Au
champ d'honneur.

Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please relocate any

The Simpsons season 3 episode "When Flanders Failed" (#38â3) is an implicit
reference to this poem. In the audio commentary to this episode which was
recorded in 2003 Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jon Vitti and Jim Reardon
talk about writer Jeff Martin who came up with this "World War I reference
which no one ever gets".

The song "We Are the Lost" by the group Libera paraphrases this poem along
with For the Fallen, sung as a choral hymn.

The poem is referenced by Mort Shuman in his translation of the song "Marieke"
by Jacques Brel as well as by Siouxsie and the Banshees in "Poppy Day" from
their second LP "Join Hands". The song was adapted as the song "Flanders
Fields" by Big Head Todd and the Monsters on their 1989 debut album "Another
Mayberry". The Guess Who parody the song in Friends Of Mine.

In the TV special "What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?", Linus recites the
poem while standing in front of the remnants of a battlefield in Ypres,
including the British aid station where McCrae was inspired to write the poem.

The poem is referenced in the film Mr. Holland's Opus and Herman Wouk's novel
City Boy.

The line "To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it
high" is written on the wall of the Montreal Canadiens' dressing room.

"The Piper" written by the fictional Walter Blythe in L. M. Montgomery's Rilla
of Ingleside is a tribute to In Flanders Field in content and form as well as
Walter's Canadian nationality.
