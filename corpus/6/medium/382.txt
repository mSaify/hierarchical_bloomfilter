### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Aposiopesis (pronounced /Ã¦pÉsaÉªÉËpisÉªs/ from Classical Greek,
á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ·ÏÎ¹Ï, "becoming silent") is a rhetorical device wherein a
sentence is deliberately broken off and left unfinished to be supplied by the
imagination, giving an impression of unwillingness or inability to continue.
An example would be the threat "Get out, or elseâ!" This device often
portrays its users as overcome with passion (fear, anger, excitement) or
modesty. To mark the occurrence of aposiopesis with punctuation an em dash or
an ellipsis may be used.

A classical example of aposiopesis in Virgil occurs in Aeneid 2.100. Sinon,
the Greek who is posing as a traitor to deceive the Trojans into accepting the
Trojan Horse within their city wall, tells about how Ulixes spread false
rumors at Sinon's expense. Indeed, Ulixes does not stop his malicious
gossiping until he causes Sinon's ruin with the help of the seer Calchas. The
whole story is a lie that Sinon tells with consummate artistry in order to
convince the Trojans that he deserted the Greeks to escape Ulixes's enmity. To
ensure the effect of his elaborate lie, Sinon at one point leaves a crucial
statement unfinished (Aen. 2.97-100):

hinc mihi prima malis labes, hinc semper Vlixes  
criminibus terrere nouis, hinc spargere uoces  
in uulgum ambiguas et quaerere conscius arma.  
nec requieuit enim, donec Calchante ministroâ  

This was the time when the first onslaught of ruin began for me.  
Ulixes kept terrifying me with new accusations,  
kept spreading ambiguous rumors among the people,  
and kept looking for quarrel.  
Nor did he in fact ever stop, until with the help of Calchasâ  

A more modern example of aposiopesis occurs in Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer:
âWell, I lay if I get ahold of you I'llâ.â

Another modern example occurs in Star Wars: A New Hope in which Darth Vader
says of Obi-Wan Kenobi, âI sense something; a presence I have not felt
sinceââ, referring to events in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.

A biblical example is found in Psalm 27, verse 13. The Hebrew, written by King
David (c. 1005â965 BCE), says in English: "Unless I had believed I would see
the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living . . . " The implication is
that David does not know what he would have done.

In syntax, an aposiopesis arises when the 'if- clause' or protasis of a
condition is stated without an ensuing 'then- clause' or apodosis.
