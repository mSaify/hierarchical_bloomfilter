In Classical Greek, Lethe (Î»Î®Î¸Î·; Classical Greek [ËlÎµËtÌªÊ°ÎµË],
modern Greek: [ËliÎ¸i]) literally means "forgetfulness" or "concealment". It
is related to the Greek word for "truth": a-lethe-ia (Î±Î»Î®Î¸ÎµÎ¹Î±), meaning
"un-forgetfulness" or "un-concealment". In Greek mythology, Lethe is one of
the several rivers of Hades: those who drank from it experienced complete
forgetfulness. Lethe was also a naiad, although the naiad Lethe is probably a
separate personification of forgetfulness rather than a reference to the river
which bears her name. She was the daughter of Eris ('Strife' in Hesiod's
Theogony), and sister to Algos, Limos, Horcus, and Ponos.

## [edit] Role in religion and philosophy

Some ancient Greeks believed that souls were made to drink from the river
before being reincarnated, so they would not remember their past lives. The
Myth of Er at the end of Plato's Republic tells of the dead arriving at the
"plain of Lethe", which the river Ameles ("careless") runs through. A few
mystery religions taught the existence of another river, the Mnemosyne; those
who drank from the Mnemosyne would remember everything and attain omniscience.
Initiates were taught that they would receive a choice of rivers to drink from
after death, and to drink from Mnemosyne instead of Lethe. These two rivers
are attested in several verse inscriptions on gold plates dating to the 4th
century BC and onward, found at Thurii in Southern Italy and elsewhere
throughout the Greek world. There were rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne at the
oracular shrine of Trophonius in Boeotia, from which worshippers would drink
before making oracular consultations with the god. More recently, Martin
Heidegger used "lÄthÄ" to symbolize the "concealment of Being" or
"forgetting of Being" that he saw as a major problem of modern philosophy.
Examples are found in his books on Nietzsche (Vol 1, p. 194) and on
Parmenides.

The River Lethe in Alaska.

Amongst authors in Antiquity, the tiny Limia River near Xinzo de Limia in the
province of Ourense in Galicia (Spain) was said to have the same properties of
memory loss as the legendary Lethe River. In 138 BC, the Roman general Decimus
Junius Brutus sought to dispose of the myth, as it impeded his military
campaigns in the area. He was said to have crossed the Limia and then called
his soldiers on the other side, one by one, by name. The soldiers, astonished
that their general remembered their names, crossed the river as well without
fear. This act proved that the Limia was not as dangerous as the local myths
described. In Alaska, a river which runs through the Valley of Ten Thousand
Smokes is called River Lethe.

River Lethe is located within the Katmai National Park and Preserve, Lake and
Peninsula County, Alaska, USA. Latitude: 58.39556 : Longitude: -155.399994
(southern Alaska). The river was named in 1917 by R. F. Griggs, during
expedition in the Katmai region for the National Geographic Society.

## [edit] Poetry

Walter Savage Landor transforms into substance the metaphor that time takes
flight when he places a few drops of Lethe's waters on wing:

> On love, on grief, on every human thing, Time sprinkles Lethe's water with
his wing.

In The Divine Comedy, the stream of Lethe flows to the centre of the earth
from its surface, but its headwaters are located in the Earthly Paradise found
at the top of the mountain of Purgatory.

In John Keats' poem, "Ode on Melancholy", the first line begins "No, no! Go
not to Lethe". In his Ode to a Nightingale the "Lethe-wards" are said to have
sunk into the narrator and created a "drowsy numbness".

The fourth stanza of the fourth canto of Byron's "Don Juan" reads:

> "And if I laugh at any mortal thing,  
>  'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,  
>  'T is that our nature cannot always bring  
>  Itself to apathy, for we must steep  
>  Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,  
>  Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:  
>  Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;  
>  A mortal mother would on Lethe fix."

In his poem "The Sleeper," Edgar Allan Poe describes a 'sleeping' "universal
valley" that includes a Lethe-like body of water.

> "Looking like Lethe, see! the lake  
>  A conscious slumber seems to take,  
>  And would not, for the world, awake."

Charles Baudelaire's poem "Spleen" ends with the lines

> "II n'a su rÃ©chauffer ce cadavre hÃ©bÃ©tÃ©  
>  OÃ¹ coule au lieu de sang l'eau verte du LÃ©thÃ©"  
>  ("He failed to warm this dazed cadaver in whose veins  
>  Flows the green water of Lethe in place of blood.").

Baudelaire also wrote a poem entitled "Le LÃ©thÃ©" ("Lethe"), in which an
adored but cruel woman serves as a metaphor for the oblivion of the river
Lethe. French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine refers to the Lethe river in
"Le Vallon" (The Vale)

> J'ai trop vu, trop senti, trop aimÃ© dans ma vie; Je viens chercher vivant
le calme du LÃ©thÃ©. (I have seen too much, felt too much, love too much in my
life; I come to seek, still living, the calm of Lethe.)

In Hymn to Proserpine (1866) by Algernon Charles Swinburne, the line "We have
drunken of things Lethean..." laments the decline of pagan tradition and
beliefs in ancient Rome following the endorsement of Christianity as the
official religion.

The Edna St. Vincent Millay poem "Lethe" describes the river as

> "the taker-away of pain,  
>  And the giver-back of beauty!"

In "The Scarlet Woman", a poem by African-American poet Fenton Johnson
(1888-1958), a young woman resorts to prostitution in order to avoid
starvation. The poem concludes with the lines

> "Now I can drink more gin than any man for miles around.  
>  Gin is better than all the water in Lethe."

"Getting There", a 1962 poem by Sylvia Plath, ends with the lines

> "And I, stepping from this skin  
>  Of old bandages, boredoms, old faces  
>  
>  Step up to you from the black car of Lethe,  
>  Pure as a baby."

The river Lethe is mentioned in Allen Ginsberg's poem "A Supermarket in
California".

Billy Collins, in his poem "Forgetfulness", refers to

> "a dark mythological river  
>  whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall".

in "Sonnet V: To the River Downs" Charlotte Smith asks the river Lethe for
forgetfulness:

> "As to the sea your limpid waves you bear,  
>  Can you one kind Leathean cup bestow,  
>  To drink a long oblivion to my care?"

## [edit] Novels

James L. Grant's horror novel, On the Banks of Lethe, a reference to the books
theme of lost memories.

In chapter 4 of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, The Scarlet Letter, Roger
Chillingworth claims, "I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe."

In Robert A. Heinlein's Time Enough for Love there is a reference to
"Neolethe" (see the chapter entitled Counterpoint I), which is apparently a
powerful sedative.

In Toni Morrison's novel Beloved, the main character's name is Sethe, a
pseudonym based on the idea of the power of water, particularly the motif that
water can weather her past.

In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing states to Lucy "It smell so
like the waters of Lethe..."(Stoker, 192) talking about the garlic which he
was going to place around her room so the Dracula would not suck her blood.

C. S. Lewis refers to Lethe in The Great Divorce when he writes, ââIt is
up there in the mountains, very cold and clear, between two green hills. A
little like Lethe. When you have drunk of it you forget forever all
proprietorship in your own works". The Spirit who talks about the fountain is
describing Heaven to an artist, telling him that soon he will forget all
ownership of his work.

In the volume, Swann's Way, of Marcel Proust's novel, Ã la recherche du temps
perdu (In Search of Lost Time), the narrator comments, as he recollects a
seemingly lost memory, "...trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a
tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the
buildings rise on it again;"

The unnamed narrator of Sasha Sokolov's first novel, A School for Fools, has a
significant habit of referring to the river running through his neighborhood
in the Russian countryside as Lethe.

Henry David Thoreau wrote in Walking: "The Atlantic is a Lethean stream, in
our passage over which we have had an opportunity to forget our Old World and
its institutions. If we do not succeed this time, there is perhaps one more
chance for the race left before it arrives on the banks of the Styx; and that
is in the Lethe of the Pacific, which is three times as wide."

In chapter 17 of Graham Greene's novel The Tenth Man, the protagonist Charlot
watches the charlatan Carosse beguile the vulnerable Mademoiselle Mangeot: "He
knew the game so well, Charlot thought: the restless playboy knew how to offer
what most people wanted more than love--peace. The words flowed like water--
the water of Lethe."

In Stephen King's novel Rose Madder, Rose, in preparation for retrieving the
title character's child from a labyrinth, is warned not to drink from the
water from a river she must cross. Later in the story, a few drops of that
water, mixed in a soft drink, is used to remove Bill's memories of the latter
part of the book's events.

In Piers Anthony's With a Tangled Skein, Niobe accompanies her daughter and
granddaughter on a quest to acquire an enchanted paint brush and a harp.
During the quest, the trio must cross an illusory representation of the Lethe.
Later, in Hell, Niobe must again cross a river, and wonders if it might be the
actual Lethe.

In Valeer Damenâs novel KATABASIS, one of the main characters has to find
and cross the river Lethe as a step in the process of entering the afterlife.
ââThere is the plain. Transit. Like a battlefield. All the energy totals
of actions and thoughts are there. Wind blows. Tests are there, functionaries,
agents from above and below. Introduction functionary cannot help solve tests
or help in final adjudication. In the end, river.ââ (Damen, 21).

## [edit] Plays

In William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, Antony, on seeing the murderers'
hands red with Caesar's blood, observes:

> "Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,/Sign'd in thy spoil, and
crimson'd in thy Lethe" (III.i.215).

Additionally, the character of Sebastian refers to Lethe in Shakespeare's
Twelfth Night:

> "Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep; If it be thus to dream, still let
me sleep!" (IV.ii.61).

In William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Hamlet's father's Ghost says to the
prince,

> "I find thee apt, And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots
itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this." (Act 1, scene
V).

In Antony and Cleopatra, Sextus Pompey talks of Antony's supposed military
inertia, hoping that

> "Epicurean cooks / Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite, / That sleep
and feeding may prorogue his honour / Even till a Lethe'd dullness-"
(II.i.24-27).

In John Webster's play The White Devil, the duke Brachiano in his death throes
says to Vittoria, whose husband he conspired to murder, along with his own
wife:

> Brac. I have drunk Lethe. Vittoria? / My dearest happiness? Vittoria?
(IV.ii.129-30)

In Samuel Beckett's radio play Embers, the main character Henry describes
conversing with his dead wife:

> "that's what hell will be like, small chat to the babbling of Lethe about
the good old days when we wished we were dead".

In Sarah Ruhl's Eurydice, the river Lethe is a central theme of the play. All
the shades must drink from Lethe and become like stones, speaking in their
inaudible language and forgetting everything of the world.

In Offenbach's operetta Orpheus in the Underworld, the character John Styx
drinks the waters of Lethe in a deliberate attempt to forget things. His
forgetfulness is a significant factor in the plot of the last act.

## [edit] Movies

In Roy Andersson's You, the Living, a quotation from Goethe's Roman Elegies

> "Be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before
Letheâs ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot"

is presented as an epigraph. Later, a tram is seen with "Lethe" as its
destination.
