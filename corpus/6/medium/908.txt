The Hajj (Arabic: Ø­Ø¬â á¸¤aÇ§Ç§) is a pilgrimage to Mecca (Makkah Mekkar).
It is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world,[1] and is the fifth pillar
of Islam, an obligation that must be carried out at least once in their
lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to do so. The Hajj is a
demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people, and their submission to
Allah.[2] The pilgrimage occurs from the 7th to 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the
12th month of the Islamic calendar. Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar
calendar, eleven days shorter than the Gregorian calendar used in the Western
world, the Gregorian date of the Hajj changes from year to year. In 2007, the
Hajj was from December 17â21; in 2008 from December 6â10, and in 2009 will
be November 25â29. Ihram is the name given to the special state in which
Muslims live whilst on the pilgrimage.

The Hajj is associated with the life of Muhammad from the 7th century, but the
ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back
thousands of years to the time of Ibrahim (Abraham). Pilgrims join processions
of hundreds of thousands of people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for
the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: Each person walks
counter-clockwise seven times about the Kaaba, the cube-shaped building which
acts as the Muslim direction of prayer; kisses the Black Stone in the corner
of the Kaaba; runs back and forth between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah;
drinks from the Zamzam Well; goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in
vigil; and throws stones in a ritual Stoning of the Devil. The pilgrims then
shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the
three day global festival of Eid al-Adha.[3][4][5]

As of 2008, about three million pilgrims participate in this annual
pilgrimage.[6][7] Crowd-control techniques have become critical, and because
of the large numbers of people, many of the rituals have become more stylized.
It is not necessary to kiss the Black Stone, but merely to point at it on each
circuit around the Kaaba. Throwing pebbles was done at large pillars, which
for safety reasons in 2004 were changed to long walls with catch basins below
to catch the stones. The slaughter of an animal can be done either personally,
or by appointing someone else to do it, and so forth.[8] But even with the
crowd control techniques, there are still many incidents during the Hajj, as
pilgrims are trampled in a crush, or ramps collapse under the weight of the
many visitors, causing hundreds of deaths. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's
Ministry of Hajj has a website, with the message, "Be peaceful, orderly and
kind. No crushing."[9]

Pilgrims can also go to Mecca to perform the rituals at other times of the
year. This is sometimes called the "lesser pilgrimage", or Umrah. However,
even if they perform the Umrah, they are still obligated to perform the Hajj
at some other point in their lifetimes if they have the means to do so.

## [edit] History

The Hajj is based on a pilgrimage that was ancient even in the time of
Muhammad in the 7th Century. According to Hadith, elements of the Hajj trace
back to the time of Abraham (Ibrahim), around 2000 BC. It is believed that the
Prophet Ibrahim was ordered by God (Allah) to leave his wife Hagar and his
infant son Ismael alone in the desert. While he was gone, the child became
thirsty, and Hagar ran back and forth seven times searching for water for her
son. The baby cried and hit the ground with his foot (some versions of the
story say that an angel scraped his foot or the tip of his wing along the
ground), and water miraculously sprang forth. This source of water is today
called the Well of Zamzam.

Prior to Muhammad's era, each year tribes from all around the Arabian
peninsula would converge on Mecca, as part of the pilgrimage. The exact faith
of the tribes was not important at that time, and Christian Arabs were as
likely to make the pilgrimage as the pagans.[10] Muslim historians refer to
the time before Muhammad as al-Jahiliyah, the "Days of Ignorance", during
which the Kaaba contained hundreds of idols â totems of each of the tribes
of the Arabian peninsula, with idols of pagan gods such as Hubal, al-Lat, Uzza
and Manat, and also some representing Jesus, and Mary.[11]

Muhammad was known to regularly perform the Umrah, even before he began
receiving revelations.[3] Historically, Muslims would gather at various
meeting points in other great cities, and then proceed en masse towards Mecca,
in groups that could comprise tens of thousands of pilgrims. Two of the most
famous meeting points were in Cairo and Damascus. In Cairo, the Sultan would
stand atop a platform of the famous gate Bab Zuwayla, to officially watch the
beginning of the annual pilgrimage.[12]

In 632 AD, when Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca, it was the
first Hajj to be performed by Muslims alone, and the only Hajj ever performed
by Muhammad. He cleansed the Kaaba, removed all of the idols, and re-ordained
the building as the house of God.[13] It was from this point that the Hajj
became one of the Five Pillars of Islam.

## [edit] Preparations

See also: Ihram

Pilgrims generally travel to Hajj in groups, as an expression of unity. Some
airlines have special packages for Muslims going to Mecca. Ships also take
pilgrims to Mecca so they can perform Hajj.

During the Hajj, male pilgrims are required to dress only in the ihram, a
garment consisting of two sheets of white unhemmed cloth, with the top draped
over the torso and the bottom secured by a white sash; plus a pair of sandals.
Women are simply required to maintain their hijab \- normal modest dress,
which does not cover the hands or face.[8]

The Ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in the eyes of Allah: that
there is no difference between a prince and a pauper when everyone is dressed
the same. Ihram is also symbolic for holy virtue and pardon from all past
sins. A place designated for changing into Ihram is called a miqat.

While wearing the Ihram, a pilgrim may not shave, clip nails, use deodorant or
perfume, swear or quarrel, kill or harm any living thing or engage in sexual
activity.

## [edit] Rites

<IMG>

<IMG>

The route the pilgrims take during the Hajj

Upon arrival in Mecca the pilgrim, now known as a Hajji,[14] performs a series
of ritual acts symbolic of the lives of Ibrahim (Abraham) and his wife Hajar
(Hagar). The acts also symbolize the solidarity of Muslims worldwide.

The greater Hajj (al-hajj al-akbar) begins on the eighth day of the lunar
month of Dhu al-Hijjah. If they are not already wearing it upon their arrival,
pilgrims put on ihram clothing and then leave Mecca for the nearby town of
Mina where they spend the rest of the day. The Saudi government has put up
thousands of large white tents at Mina to provide accommodations for all the
pilgrims.[4]

### [edit] Umrah

<IMG>

<IMG>

Direction of the Tawaf around the Kaaba

Main article: Umrah

On the first day of the Hajj (the 8th day of the 12th month in other words,
Dhu al-Hijjah), the pilgrims perform their first Tawaf, which involves all of
the pilgrims entering The Sacred Mosque (Masjid Al Haram) and walking seven
times counter-clockwise around the Kaaba, kissing the Black Stone (Hajr Al
Aswad) on each circuit. If kissing the stone is not possible due to the
crowds, they may simply point towards the Stone on each circuit. Each complete
circuit constitutes a "Shout" with 7 circuits constituting a complete tawaf.
The place where pilgrims walk is known as "Mutaaf". Only the first three
Shouts are compulsory, but invariably almost all perform it seven times.

Eating is not permitted and the tawaf is normally performed all at once, the
only exception being the drinking of water. Men are encouraged to perform the
first three circuits at a hurried pace, followed by four times, more closely,
at a leisurely pace.[8]

After the completion of Tawaf, all the pilgrims have to offer two Rakaat
prayers at the Place of Abraham (Muqaam E Ibrahim), a site inside the mosque
that is near the Kaaba. However, again due to large crowds during the days of
Hajj, they may instead pray anywhere in the mosque.

Although the circuits around the Kaaba are traditionally done on the
groundlevel, Tawaf is now also performed on the first floor and roof of the
mosque.

After Tawaf on the same day, the pilgrims perform sa`i, running or walking
seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah. This is a re-enactment of
the frantic search for water for her son Ismael by Abraham's wife Hagar. As
she searched, the Zamzam Well was revealed to her by an angel, who hit the
ground with his heel (or brushed the ground with the tip of his wing), upon
which the water of the Zamzam started gushing from the ground.[15] The back
and forth circuit of the pilgrims used to be in the open air, but is now
entirely enclosed by the Masjid al-Haram mosque, and can be accessed via air-
conditioned tunnels. Pilgrims are advised to walk the circuit, though two
green pillars mark a short section of the path where they are allowed to run.
There is also an internal "express lane" for the disabled. The safety
procedures are in place because previous incidents in this ritual have
resulted in stampedes which caused the deaths of hundreds of people.

As part of this ritual the pilgrims also drink water from the Zamzam Well,
which is made available in coolers throughout the Mosque. After the visit to
the mosque on this day of the Hajj, the pilgrims then return to their tents.

### [edit] Arafat

Main article: Mount Arafat

<IMG>

<IMG>

Pilgrims on Plains of Arafat on the day of Hajj

The next morning, on the ninth of Dhu al-Hijjah, the pilgrims leave their
tents at Mina for Mount Arafat, where they stand in contemplative vigil, near
a hill from which Muhammad gave his last sermon. This is considered the
highlight of the Hajj. Pilgrims must spend the afternoon within a defined area
on the plain of Arafat until after sunset. No specific rituals or prayers are
required during the stay at Arafat, although many pilgrims spend time praying,
and thinking about the course of their lives. If a pilgrim does not spend the
afternoon on Arafat, then their pilgrimage is considered invalid.[4]

### [edit] Muzdalifah

As soon as the sun sets, the pilgrims leave Arafat for Muzdalifah, an area
between Arafat and Mina, where they gather pebbles for the next day's ritual
of the stoning of the Devil (Shaitan). Many pilgrims spend the night sleeping
on the ground or back in their tents at Muzdalifah before returning to Mina.

### [edit] Ramy al-Jamarat

<IMG>

<IMG>

Pilgrims at the Jamrah of Aqaba at Hajj, 2006

Main article: Stoning of the Devil

At Mina the pilgrims perform Ramy al-Jamarat, throwing stones to signify their
defiance of the Devil. This symbolizes the trials experienced by Abraham while
he decided whether to sacrifice his son as demanded by Allah. The Devil
challenged him three times, and three times Abraham refused. Each pillar marks
the location of one of these refusals. On the first occasion when Ramy al-
Jamarat is performed, pilgrims stone the largest pillar known as
Jamrat'al'Aqabah. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamarat Bridge,
from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. On the second
occasion, the other pillars are stoned.[16] The stoning consists of throwing
seven pebbles.[4] Because of the crowds, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by
long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.

### [edit] Eid al-Adha

Main article: Eid al-Adha

After the Stoning of the Devil, the pilgrims perform animal sacrifices, to
symbolize God having mercy on Abraham and replacing his son with a ram, which
Abraham then sacrificed. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal
themselves, or oversaw the slaughtering. Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice
voucher in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an animal to be
slaughtered in their name on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically
present. Centralized butcher houses sacrifice a single sheep for each pilgrim,
or a cow can represent the sacrifice of seven people. The meat is then
packaged and given to charity and shipped to poor people around the world.[4]
At the same time as the sacrifices occur at Mecca, Muslims worldwide perform
similar sacrifices, in a four-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.

### [edit] Tawaf az-Ziyarah

<IMG>

<IMG>

Pilgrims circumambulating the Kaaba during the Hajj

On this or the following day the pilgrims re-visit the Masjid al-Haram mosque
in Mecca for another tawaf, to walk around the Kaaba. This is called the Tawaf
az-Ziyarah or Tawaf al-Ifadah, which symbolises being in a hurry to respond to
God and show love for Him, an obligatory part of the Hajj. The night of the
10th is spent back at Mina.

On the afternoon of the 11th and again the following day the pilgrims must
again throw seven pebbles at each of the three jamarat in Mina.

Pilgrims must leave Mina for Mecca before sunset on the 12th. If they are
unable to leave Mina before sunset, they must perform the stoning ritual again
on the 13th before returning to Mecca.

### [edit] Tawaf al-Wada

Finally, before leaving Mecca, pilgrims perform a farewell tawaf called the
Tawaf al-Wada.[4]

### [edit] Journey to Medina

Though it is not required as part of the Hajj, many pilgrims also travel to
the city of Medina and the Mosque of the Prophet, which contains Muhammad's
tomb, and that of his daughter, Fatima.

## [edit] Social effect of Hajj

Main article: Incidents during the Hajj

There have been many incidents during the Hajj that have led to the loss of
many hundreds of lives. The worst of these incidents have usually occurred
during the Stoning of the Devil ritual. During the 2006 Hajj on January 12,
362 pilgrims died. Tramplings have also occurred when pilgrims try to run
between the two hills known as As-Safa and Al-Marwa. In 2006 there were some
600 casualties among pilgrims performing the Hajj. After these events, the
Saudi government made improvements for pilgrims such as providing separate
pathways for travelling to and from the Al-Safa and Al-Marwa.

A 2008 study on the longer-term effect of participating in the Islamic
pilgrimage found that Muslims' communities become more open after the Hajj
experience.

Entitled âEstimating the Impact of the Haj: Religion and Tolerance in
Islamâs Global Gatheringâ, the Harvard University Kennedy School of
government study found that the Hajj experience promotes peaceful coexistence,
equality, and harmony.[17] Specifically, the report states that the Hajj
"increases belief in equality and harmony among ethnic groups and Islamic
sects and leads to more favorable attitudes toward women, including greater
acceptance of female education and employment" and that "Hajjis (those who
have performed the Hajj) show increased belief in peace, and in equality and
harmony among adherents of different religions"

## [edit] Number of foreign pilgrims by year

According to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, the following number of
foreign pilgrims arrived in Saudia Arabia each year, to perform the Hajj:

  * 1996 \- 1,080,465[18]
  * 1997 \- 1,168,591[19]
