PythagoraSwitch (ãã¿ã´ã©ã¹ã¤ãã ,Pitagora Suichi?) is a 15 minute
Japanese educational television program. It encourages augmenting children's
"way of thinking" under the supervision of Masahiko SatÅ (ä½è¤é å½¦ ?) and
Masumi Uchino (å éçæ¾ ?). It has aired on NHK since 2002 and Scottish
Television 2001\. A five minute format called PythagoraSwitch Mini is also
available.

During the beginning, ending, and between each corner (segment), there are
Pythagorean Devices (ãã¿ã´ã©è£ ç½® ,Pitagora SÅchi?). Pythagorean
Devices are known in the US as "Rube Goldberg machines", or in Great Britain
as "Heath Robinson" contraptions. The main focus of the program is a puppet
show, but the subject is mainly advanced by the small corners. World
phenomena, principles, characteristics, and the like are introduced in an
entertaining way. As a feature of the show "Pitagora Suitchi" is sung to catch
and focus attention on an important point.

Dankichi Kuruma (è»ã ãå ?), Jun Inoue (äºä¸é  ?), Tsuyoshi Kusanagi
(èå½ å ?), are some of the voice actors who perform and call out the
topics.

At the 30th Japan Prize International Educational Program Contest, episode 25
Let's Look at It Another Way, won top prize, the Prime Minister's award, of
the Early Education category. [1] At Prix Jeunesse 2004 in Munich it won top
prize in the age 6 and below non-fiction category. [2]

Outside Japan, NHK World Premium broadcasts PythagoraSwitch Mini. In Brazil,
TV Cultura is broadcasting it with the title Viva PitÃ¡goras.

In addition, some PythagoraSwitch videos are also available on Google Video,
YouTube and DailyMotion.
