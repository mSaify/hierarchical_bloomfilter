Analytical psychology (or Jungian psychology) is the school of psychology
originating from the ideas of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, and then advanced
by his students and other thinkers who followed in his tradition. It is
distinct from Freudian psychoanalysis but also has a number of similarities.
Its aim is the apprehension and integration of the deep forces and motivations
underlying human behavior by the practice of an accumulative phenomenology
around the significance of dreams, folklore and mythology. Depth psychology
and archetypal psychology are related in that they both employ the model of
the unconscious mind as the source of healing and development in the
individual.

## [edit] Overview

Jung developed his own distinctive approach to the study of the human mind. In
his early years when working in a Swiss hospital with schizophrenic patients
and working with Sigmund Freud and the burgeoning psychoanalytic community, he
took a closer look at the mysterious depths of the human unconscious.
Fascinated by what he saw (and spurred on with even more passion by the
experiences and questions of his personal life) he devoted his life to the
exploration of the unconscious. Unlike many modern psychologists, Jung did not
feel that experimenting using natural science was the best means to understand
the human psyche. For him, an empirical investigation of the world of dream,
myth, and folklore represented the most promising road to its deeper
understanding.

The overarching goal of Jungian psychology is the reconciliation of the life
of the individual with the world of the supra-personal archetypes. Central to
this process is the individual's encounter with the unconscious. Humans
experience the unconscious through symbols encountered in all aspects of life:
in dreams, art, religion, and the symbolic dramas we enact in our
relationships and life pursuits. Essential to the encounter with the
unconscious, and the reconciliation of the individual's consciousness with
this broader world, is learning this symbolic language. Only through attention
and openness to this world is the individual able to harmonize his or her life
with these suprapersonal archetypal forces.

"Neurosis" results from a disharmony between the individual's consciousness
and the greater archetypal world. The aim of psychotherapy is to assist the
individual in reestablishing a healthy relationship to the unconscious
(neither being swamped by it â a state characteristic of psychosis â nor
completely shut off from it â a state that results in malaise, empty
consumerism, narcissism, and a life cut off from deeper meaning). The
encounter between consciousness and the symbols arising from the unconscious
enriches life and promotes psychological development. Jung considered this
process of psychological growth and maturation (which he called the process of
individuation) to be of critical importance to the human being, and ultimately
to modern society.

In order to undergo the individuation process, the individual must be open to
the parts of oneself beyond one's own ego. In order to do this, the modern
individual must pay attention to dreams, explore the world of religion and
spirituality, and question the assumptions of the operant societal worldview
(rather than just blindly living life in accordance with dominant norms and
assumptions).

## [edit] Fundamentals

### [edit] Unconscious

Main articles: Unconscious, Collective unconscious, and Archetypes

The basic assumption is that the personal unconscious is a potent part â
probably the more active part â of the normal human psyche. Reliable
communication between the conscious and unconscious parts of the psyche is
necessary for wholeness.

Also crucial is the belief that dreams show ideas, beliefs, and feelings of
which individuals are not readily aware, but need to be, and that such
material is expressed in a personalized vocabulary of visual metaphors. Things
"known but unknown" are contained in the unconscious, and dreams are one of
the main vehicles for the unconscious to express them.

Analytical psychology distinguishes between a personal and a collective
unconscious. (see below)

The collective unconscious contains archetypes common to all human beings.
That is, individuation may bring to surface symbols that do not relate to the
life experiences of a single person. This content is more easily viewed as
answers to the more fundamental questions of humanity: life, death, meaning,
happiness, fear. Among these more spiritual concepts may arise and be
integrated into the personality.

### [edit] Collective unconscious

Jung's concept of the collective unconscious has often been misunderstood. In
order to understand this concept, it is essential to understand Jungian
archetypes.

The archetypes of the collective unconscious could be thought of as the DNA of
the human psyche.[citation needed] Just as all humans share a common physical
heritage and predisposition towards specific gross physical forms (like having
two legs, a heart, etc.) so do all humans have innate psychological
predispositions in the form of archetypes, which compose the collective
unconscious.

In contrast to the objective material world, the subjective realm of
archetypes cannot be fully plumbed through quantitative modes of research.
Instead it can be revealed more fully through an examination of the symbolic
communications of the human psyche â in art, dreams, religion, myth, and the
themes of human relational/behavioural patterns. Devoting his life to the task
of exploring and understanding the collective unconscious, Jung theorized that
certain symbolic themes exist across all cultures, all epochs, and in every
individual.

### [edit] Archetypes

Main article: Jungian archetypes

The use of psychological archetypes was advanced by Jung in 1919. In Jung's
psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas
and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and
interpretations associated with an archetype is a complex, e.g. a mother
complex associated with the mother archetype. Jung treated the archetypes as
psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are
morphological givens that arose through evolution.

### [edit] Self-realization and neuroticism

Main articles: Self-realization and Neuroticism

An innate need for self-realization leads people to explore and integrate
these rejected materials. This natural process is called individuation, or the
process of becoming an individual.

According to Jung, self-realization can be divided into two distinct tiers. In
the first half of our lives we separate from humanity. We attempt to create
our own identities (I, myself). This is why there is such a need for young men
to be destructive, and can be expressed as animosity from teens directed at
their parents. Jung also said we have a sort of âsecond pubertyâ that
occurs between 35-40- outlook shifts from emphasis on materialism, sexuality,
and having children to concerns about community and spirituality.

In the second half of our lives, humans reunite with the human race. They
become part of the collective once again. This is when adults start to
contribute to humanity (volunteer time, build, garden, create art, etc.)
rather than destroy. They are also more likely to pay attention to their
unconscious and conscious feelings. Young men rarely say "I feel angry." or "I
feel sad.â This is because they have not yet rejoined the human collective
experience, commonly reestablished in their older, wiser years, according to
Jung. A common theme is for young rebels to "search" for their true selves and
realize that a contribution to humanity is essentially a necessity for a whole
self.

Jung proposes that the ultimate goal of the collective unconscious and self-
realization is to pull us to the highest experience. This, of course, is
spiritual.

If a person does not proceed toward self-knowledge, neurotic symptoms may
arise. Symptoms are widely defined, including, for instance, phobias,
fetishism, depression.

### [edit] Shadow

The shadow is an unconscious complex that is defined as the repressed and
suppressed aspects of the conscious self.

There are constructive and destructive types of shadow.

On the destructive side, it often represents everything that the conscious
person does not wish to acknowledge within themselves. For instance, someone
who identifies as being kind has a shadow that is harsh or unkind. Conversely,
an individual who is brutal has a kind shadow. The shadow of persons who are
convinced that they are ugly appears to be beautiful.

On the constructive side, the shadow may represent hidden positive influences.
This has been referred to as "the gold in the shadow." Jung points to the
story of Moses and Al-Khidr in the 18th Sura (Chapter) of the Koran (Qu'ran?)
as an example.

Jung emphasized the importance of being aware of shadow material and
incorporating it into conscious awareness, lest one project these attributes
on others.

The shadow in dreams is often represented by dark figures of the same gender
as the dreamer.

According to Jung the human being deals with the reality of the Shadow in four
ways: denial, projection, integration and/or transmutation.

### [edit] Anima and animus

Jung identified the anima as being the unconscious feminine component of men
and the animus as the unconscious masculine component in women. However, this
is rarely taken as a literal definition: many modern day Jungian practitioners
believe that every person has both an anima and an animus. Jung stated that
the anima and animus act as guides to the unconscious unified Self, and that
forming an awareness and a connection with the anima or animus is one of the
most difficult and rewarding steps in psychological growth. Jung reported that
he identified his anima as she spoke to him, as an inner voice, unexpectedly
one day.

Often, when people ignore the anima or animus complexes, the anima or animus
vies for attention by projecting itself on others. This explains, according to
Jung, why we are sometimes immediately attracted to certain strangers: we see
our anima or animus in them. Love at first sight is an example of anima and
animus projection. Moreover, people who strongly identify with their gender
role (e.g. a man who acts aggressively and never cries) have not actively
recognized or engaged their anima or animus.

Jung attributes human rational thought to be the male nature, while the
irrational aspect is considered to be natural female. Consequently,
irrationality is the male anima shadow and rationality is the female animus
shadow.

### [edit] Psychoanalysis

Main articles: Psychoanalysis and Dream analysis

Analysis is a way to experience and integrate the unknown material. It is a
search for the meaning of behaviours, symptoms, events. Many are the channels
to reach this greater self-knowledge. The analysis of dreams is the most
common. Others may include expressing feelings in art pieces, poetry or other
expressions of creativity.

Giving a complete description of the process of dream interpretation and
individuation is complex. The nature of the complexity lies on the fact that
the process is highly specific to the person who does it.

While Freudian psychoanalysis assumes that the repressed material hidden in
the unconscious is given by repressed sexual instincts, Analytical psychology
has a more general approach. There is no preconceived assumption about the
unconscious material. The unconscious, for Jungian analysts, may contain
repressed sexual drives, but also aspirations, fears, etc.

## [edit] Psychological types

Analytical psychology distinguishes several psychological types or
temperaments.

  * Extravert (Jung's spelling is "extravert", which most dictionaries also use; the variant "extrovert" is not preferred)
  * Introvert

The attitude type could be thought of as the flow of libido (psychic energy).
An introverted person's energy is generally directed inward toward concepts
and ideas whereas an extraverted person's energy is generally directed outward
towards other people and objects. There are several contrasting
characteristics between extraverts and introverts: extraverts desire breadth
and are action-oriented, while introverts seek depth and are self-oriented.

Some research has suggested that there may be a positive correlation between
introversion and extraversion with psychological disorders.[citation needed]
Introverts may be more inclined to catatonic type schizophrenia and extraverts
towards bipolar disorder.[citation needed]

According to Jung, the conscious psyche is an apparatus for adaptation and
orientation, and consists of a number of different psychic functions. Among
these he distinguishes four basic functions:[1]

  * sensation \- perception by means of the sense organs;
  * intuition \- perceiving in unconscious way or perception of unconscious contents.
  * thinking \- function of intellectual cognition; the forming of logical conclusions;
  * feeling \- function of subjective estimation;

Thinking and feeling functions are rational, while sensation and intuition are
nonrational. According to Jung, rationality consists of figurative thoughts,
feelings or actions with reason â a point of view based on objective value,
which is set by practical experience. Nonrationality is not based in reason.
Jung notes that elementary facts are also nonrational, not because they are
illogical but because, as thoughts, they are not judgments.

In any person, the degree of introversion/extraversion of one function can be
quite different from that of another function.

Generally, we tend to favor our most developed, dominant function, while we
can broaden our personality by developing the others. Related to this, Jung
noted that the unconscious often tends to reveal itself most easily through a
person's least developed, inferior function. The encounter with the
unconscious and development of the underdeveloped function(s) thus tend to
progress together.

## [edit] Complexes

Main article: Complex (psychology)

Early in Jung's career he coined the term and described the concept of the
"complex". Jung claims to have discovered the concept during his free
association and galvanic skin response experiments. Freud obviously took up
this concept in his Oedipus complex amongst others. Jung seemed to see
complexes as quite autonomous parts of psychological life. It is almost as if
Jung were describing separate personalities within what is considered a single
individual, but to equate Jung's use of complexes with something along the
lines of multiple personality disorder would be a step out of bounds.

Jung saw an archetype as always being the central organizing structure of a
complex. For instance, in a "negative mother complex," the archetype of the
"negative mother" would be seen to be central to the identity of that complex.
This is to say, our psychological lives are patterned on common human
experiences. Interestingly, Jung saw the Ego (which Freud wrote about in
German literally as the "I", one's conscious experience of oneself) as a
complex. If the "I" is a complex, what might be the archetype that structures
it? Jung, and many Jungians, might say "the hero," one who separates from the
community to ultimately carry the community further.

## [edit] Clinical theories

Main article: Psychoanalysis

Jung's writings have been of much interest to people of many backgrounds and
interests, including theologians, people from the humanities, and
mythologists. Jung often seemed to seek to make contributions to various
fields, but he was mostly a practicing psychiatrist, involved during his whole
career in treating patients. A description of Jung's clinical relevance is to
address the core of his work.

Jung started his career working with hospitalized patients with major mental
illnesses, most notably schizophrenia. He was interested in the possibilities
of an unknown "brain toxin" that could be the cause of schizophrenia. But the
majority and the heart of Jung's clinical career was taken up with what we
might call today individual psychodynamic psychotherapy, in gross structure
very much in the strain of psychoanalytic practice first formed by Freud.

It is important to state that Jung seemed to often see his work as not a
complete psychology in itself but as his unique contribution to the field of
psychology. Jung claimed late in his career that only for about a third of his
patients did he use "Jungian analysis." For another third, Freudian psychology
seemed to best suit the patient's needs and for the final third Adlerian
analysis was most appropriate. In fact, it seems that most contemporary
Jungian clinicians merge a developmentally grounded theory, such as Self
psychology or Donald Winnicott's work, with the Jungian theories in order to
have a "whole" theoretical repertoire to do actual clinical work.

The "I" or Ego is tremendously important to Jung's clinical work. Jung's
theory of etiology of psychopathology could almost be simplified to be stated
as a too rigid conscious attitude towards the whole of the psyche. That is, a
psychotic episode can be seen from a Jungian perspective as the "rest" of the
psyche overwhelming the conscious psyche because the conscious psyche
effectively was locking out and repressing the psyche as a whole.

John Weir Perry's book The Far Side of Madness explores and fleshes out this
idea of Jung's very well. The story is a psychological description of a
psychotic episode.

## [edit] Post-Jungian approaches

Andrew Samuels (1985) has distinguished three distinct traditions or
approaches of "post-Jungian" psychology - classical, developmental and
archetypal. Today there are more developments.

### [edit] Classical

The classical approach is that which tries to remain faithful to what Jung
himself proposed and taught in person and in his 20-plus volumes of work.
Prominent advocates of this approach, according to Samuels (1985), include
Emma Jung (C.G. Jung's wife, who was an analyst in her own right), Marie-
Louise von Franz, Joseph Henderson, Amelia Jaffe, Erich Neumann, Gerhard Adler
and Jolandi Jacobi.

### [edit] Developmental

The developmental approach is primarily associated with Michael Fordham and
his wife, Frieda Fordham. It can be considered a bridge traditional between
Jungian analysis and Melanie Klein's object relations theory. Laings and
Goodheart are also often mentioned. Samuels (1985) considers J. Redfearn,
Richard Carvalho and himself (Andrew Samuels) as representatives of the
developmental approach. Samuels notes how this approach differs from the
classical by giving less emphasis to the Self and more emphasis to the
development of personality; he also notes how, in terms of practice in
therapy, it gives more attention to transference and counter-transference than
either the classical or the archetypal approaches.

### [edit] Archetypal

Main articles: Archetypal psychology and Mythopoetic men's movement

The archetypal approach (sometimes called "the imaginal school") was developed
by James Hillman in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its adherents, according
to Samuels (1985), include Murray Stein, Rafael Lopez-Pedraza and Wolfgang
Giegirch. It may also be associated with mythopoeticists such as Clarissa
Pinkola EstÃ©s who believes that ethnic and aboriginal people are the
originators of archetypal psychology and have long carried the maps for the
journey of the soul in their songs, tales, dream-telling, art and rituals;
Marion Woodman who proposes a feminist viewpoint regarding archetypal
psychology, and other Jungians such as Thomas Moore. Most
mythopoetic/archetypal psychology innovators either imagine the Self not to be
the main archetype of the collective unconscious as Jung thought, but rather
assign each archetype equal value.[citation needed] Others, who are modern
progenitors of archetypal psychology (such as EstÃ©s), think of the Self as
that which contains and yet is suffused by all the other archetypes, each
giving life to the other.

Robert L. Moore has explored the archetypal level of the human psyche in a
series of five books co-authored with Douglas Gillette, which have played an
important role in the men's movement in the United States. Moore likes to use
computerese so he likens the archetypal level of the human psyche to a
computer's hard wiring (its fixed physical components). Our personal
experiences influence our accessing the archetypal level of the human psyche,
but personalized ego consciousness can be likened to computer software.

### [edit] Process-Oriented Psychology

Main article: Process Oriented Psychology

Process-Oriented Psychology (also called Process Work) is associated with the
Zurich trained Jungian analyst Arnold Mindell. Process Work developed in the
late 1970s and early 1980s and was originally identified as a "daughter of
Jungian psychology".[citation needed] Process Work stresses awareness of the
"unconscious" as an ongoing flow of experience. This approach expands Jung's
work beyond verbal individual therapy to include body experience, altered and
comatose states as well as multicultural group work.
