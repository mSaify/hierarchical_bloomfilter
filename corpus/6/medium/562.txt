## [edit] Sunni schools of law (Madhhab)

Islamic law is known as the SharÄ«âah. The SharÄ«âah is based on the
Qur'an and the Sunnah, and those who respective founders are:

  * Hanafi School (founded by Abu Hanifa)

Abu Hanifa (d. 767), was the founder of the Hanafi school. He was born circa
702 in Kufa, Iraq.[2][3] Muslims of Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan,
Central Asia, Muslim areas Southern Russia, The Caucasus, parts of The
Balkans,Iraq and Turkey follow this school.

  * Maliki School (founded by Malik ibn Anas)

Malik ibn Anas(d. 795) developed his ideas in Medina, where he knew some of
the last surviving companions of the Prophet or their immediate descendents.
His doctrine is recorded in the Muwatta which has been adopted by most Muslims
of Africa except in Lower Egypt, Zanzibar and South Africa. The Maliki legal
school is the branch of Sunni that dominates most of the Muslim areas of
Africa, except Egypt and the Horn of Africa.

  * Shafi'i School (founded by Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i)

Al-Shafiâi (d. 820) He taught in Iraq and then in Egypt. Muslims in
Indonesia, Lower Egypt, Malaysia, Singapore, Somalia, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria,
Kerala, India, Palestine, Yemen and Kurds in the Kurdish regions follow this
school. Al-Shafi'i placed great emphasis on the Sunnah of the Prophet, as
embodied in the Hadith, as a source of the Shari'ah.

  * Hanbali School (founded by Ahmad bin Hanbal)

Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855) was born in Baghdad. He learned extensively from al-
Shafi'i. Despite persecution, he held to the doctrine that the Qur'an was
uncreated. This school of law is followed primarily in the Arabian Peninsula.

The followers of these four schools follow the same basic belief system but
differ from one another in terms of practice and execution of rituals, and in
juristic interpretation of "divine principals" (or Shariah) as envisaged in
Quran and Hadith. However Sunni Muslims consider them all equally valid.

There are other Sunni schools of law. However, many are followed by only small
numbers of people and are relatively unknown due to the popularity of the four
major schools; also, many have died out or were not sufficiently recorded by
their followers to survive.

Interpreting the Shari'ah to derive specific rulings (such as how to pray) is
known as fiqh, which literally means understanding. A madhhab is a particular
tradition of interpreting fiqh. These schools focus on specific evidence
(Shafi'i and Hanbali) or general principles (Hanafi and Maliki) derived from
specific evidences. The schools were started by eminent Muslim scholars in the
first four centuries of Islam. As these schools represent clearly spelled out
methodologies for interpreting the Shari'aa, there has been little change in
the methodology per se. However, as the social and economic environment
changes, new fiqh rulings are being made. For example, when tobacco appeared
it was declared as 'disliked' because of its smell. When medical information
showed that smoking was dangerous, that ruling was changed to
'forbidden'.[citation needed] Current fiqh issues include things like
downloading pirated software and cloning. The consensus is that the Shari'ah
does not change but fiqh rulings change all the time.

A madhhab is not to be confused with a religious sect. There may be scholars
representing all four madhhabs living in larger Muslim communities, and it is
up to those who consult them to decide which school they prefer.

Many Sunnis advocate that a Muslim should choose a single madhhab and follow
it in all matters. However, rulings from another madhhab are considered
acceptable as dispensations (rukhsa) in exceptional circumstances. Some
Sunnis, however, do not follow any madhhab,. Indeed, some Salafis and Ahle
Hadith reject strict adherence to any particular school of thought, preferring
to use the Qur'an and the Sunnah as the primary sources of Islamic law or the
ruling by any of the jurists if it is in accordance with Quran and Hadith.

Allah says in the Quran, Obey Allah and obey the messenger. Hence, according
to Sunni Islam Quran and the authentic teachings of Muhammad (the last and
final Messenger of Allah, previously Moses, Jesus, David, Solomon, Noah etc)
supersede all schools of thoughts.

## [edit] Sunni theological traditions

Some Islamic scholars faced questions that they felt were not specifically
answered in the Qur'an, especially questions with regard to philosophical
conundra like the nature of God, the existence of human free will, or the
eternal existence of the Qur'an. Various schools of theology and philosophy
developed to answer these questions, each claiming to be true to the Qur'an
and the Muslim tradition (sunnah). Among Sunnites, the following were the
dominant traditions:

  * Ash'ari, founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (873â935). This theology was embraced by Muslim scholars such as al-Ghazali. 
    * Ash'ariyyah theology stresses divine revelation over human reason. Ethics, they say, cannot be derived from human reason: God's commands, as revealed in the Qur'an and the practice of Muhammad and his companions (the sunnah, as recorded in the traditions, or hadith), are the source of all morality.
    * Regarding the nature of God and the divine attributes, the Ash'ari rejected the Mu'tazilite position that all Qur'anic references to God as having physical attributes (that is, a body) were metaphorical.[4] Ash'aris insisted that these attributes were "true", since the Qur'an could not be in error, but that they were not to be understood as implying a crude anthropomorphism.
    * Ash'aris tend to stress divine omnipotence over human free will. They believe that the Qur'an is eternal and uncreated.
  * Maturidiyyah, founded by Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944). Maturidiyyah was a minority tradition until it was accepted by the Turkish tribes of Central Asia (previously they had been Ashari and followers of the Shafi school,[citation needed] it was only later on migration into Anatolia that they became Hanafi and followers of the Maturidi creed[citation needed]). One of the tribes, the Seljuk Turks, migrated to Turkey, where later the Ottoman Empire was established.[5] Their preferred school of law achieved a new prominence throughout their whole empire although it continued to be followed almost exclusively by followers of the Hanafi school while followers of the Shafi, Maliki, and Hanbali schools within the empire followed the Ashari school. Thus, wherever can be found Hanafi followers, there can be found the Maturidi creed. 
    * Maturidiyyah argue that knowledge of God's existence can be derived through reason.
  * Athariyyah (meaning Textualist) or Hanbali. No specific founder, but Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal played a key historic role in keeping this school alive. 
    * This school differs with the Ash'ariyyah in understanding the names and attributes of God, but rather affirms all of God's names and attributes as they are found in the Qur'an and Sunnah (prophetic traditions), with the disclaimer that the "how" of the attribute is not known. They say that God is as He described Himself "in a way befitting of His majesty." Thus, regarding verses where God is described as having a yad (hand) or wajh (face), the textualists say that God is exactly as He described himself in a way befitting of His majesty, without inquiring as to the "how" of these attributes.
    * The Athariyyah still believe that God does not resemble His creation in any way, as this is also found in the texts. Thus, in the Athari creed, it is still prohibited to imagine an image of God in any way. The Athariyyah say that the yad" (hand) of God is "unlike any other yad" (since God does not resemble His creation in any way) and prohibit imagining what God would be like, even though this attribute of a yad is still affirmed.
    * This is the view of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal who said: "The hadiths (regarding the attributes of Allah) should be left as they are... We affirm them, and we do not make any similitude for them. This is what has been agreed upon by the scholars."[6]

## [edit] Sunni view of hadith

The Qur'an as we have it today was compiled by Muhammad's companions (Sahaba)
in approximately 650, and is accepted by all Muslim denominations. However,
there were many matters of belief and daily life that were not directly
prescribed in the Qur'an, but were actions that were observed by the prophet
and the community. Later generations sought out oral traditions regarding the
early history of Islam, and the practice of Muhammad and his first followers,
and wrote them down so that they might be preserved. These recorded oral
traditions are called hadith. Muslim scholars sifted through the hadith and
evaluated the chain of narration of each tradition, scrutinizing the
trustworthiness of the narrators and judging the strength of each hadith
accordingly. Most Sunni accept the hadith collections of Bukhari and Muslim as
the most authentic (sahih, or correct), and grant a lesser status to the
collections of other recorders. There are, however, four other collections of
hadith that are also held in particular reverence by Sunni Muslims, making a
total of six:

  * Sahih al-Bukhari
  * Sahih Muslim
  * Sunan an-Nasa'ii
  * Sunan Abu Dawud
  * Sunan at-Tirmidhi
  * Sunan ibn Majah

There are also other collections of hadith which, although less well-known,
are still thought to contain many authentic hadith and are frequently used by
specialists. Examples of these collections include:

  * Muwatta of Imam Malik
  * Musnad of Ahmad ibn Hanbal
  * Sahih Ibn Khuzaima
  * Sahih Ibn Hibban
  * Mustadrak of Al Haakim
  * Musannaf of Abd al-Razzaq

## [edit] Demographics

Distribution of Sunni and Shia populations

Main article: Demographics of Islam

There are many challenges to demographers attempting to calculate the
proportion of the world's Muslim population who adhere to Sunni and Shi'a
Islam. Using various sources, estimates of the proportion of Muslims adhering
to Shi'a Islam range anywhere from 15% to 20% worldwide depending on the
sources.
