## [edit] Sponsors and partnerships

In addition to fans, some YouTube celebrities have corporate sponsors, who pay
for product placement in their clips or production of online ads. Some have
quit their day jobs or changed careers to accommodate their YouTube filming
schedules. A handful are also official "YouTube Partners," meaning the company
cuts them a share of ad revenue. [7] [82] [83][84] [42][13]
