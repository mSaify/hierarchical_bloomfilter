Pluto (pronounced en-us-Pluto.ogg /ËpluËtoÊ/ (helpÂ·info),[8] from Latin:
PlÅ«to), formal designation (134340) Pluto, is the second-largest known dwarf
planet in the Solar System (after Eris) and the tenth-largest body observed
directly orbiting the Sun. Originally classified as a planet, Pluto is now
considered the largest member of a distinct population called the Kuiper
belt.[9]

Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is composed primarily of rock and
ice and is relatively small: approximately a fifth the mass of the Earth's
Moon and a third its volume. It has an eccentric and highly inclined orbit
that takes it from 30 to 49 AU (4.4â7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This
causes Pluto periodically to come closer to the Sun than Neptune.

Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, are sometimes treated together as a binary
system because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within either
body.[10] The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has yet to formalise a
definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, Charon
is classified as a moon of Pluto.[11] Pluto has two known smaller moons, Nix
and Hydra, discovered in 2005.[12] Like Uranus, Pluto rotates on its "side"
relative to its orbital plane, and the Pluto-Charon system does also. [13]

From its discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto was considered the Solar System's
ninth planet. In the early 21st century, however, many objects similar to
Pluto were discovered in the outer solar system, notably the scattered disc
object Eris, which is 27% more massive than Pluto.[14] On August 24, 2006, the
IAU defined the term "planet" for the first time. This definition excluded
Pluto as a planet, and added it as member of the new category of "dwarf
planet" along with Eris and Ceres.[15] After the reclassification, Pluto was
added to the list of minor planets and given the number 134340.[16][17] A
number of scientists continue to hold that Pluto should be classified as a
planet.[18]

Clyde W. Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto.

In the 1840s, using Newtonian mechanics, Urbain Le Verrier predicted the
position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analysing perturbations
in the orbit of Uranus.[19] Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late
19th century caused astronomers to speculate that Uranus' orbit was being
disturbed by another planet in addition to Neptune. In 1906, Percival Lowell,
a wealthy Bostonian who had founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff,
Arizona in 1894, started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth
planet, which he termed "Planet X".[20] By 1909, Lowell and William H.
Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a
planet.[21] Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in
1916, but to no avail. Unbeknownst to Lowell, on March 19, 1915, his
observatory had captured two faint images of Pluto, but did not recognise them
for what they were.[21][22]

Due to a ten-year legal battle with Constance Lowell, Percival's widow, who
attempted to wrest the observatory's million-dollar portion of his legacy for
herself, the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929,[23] when its
director, Vesto Melvin Slipher, summarily handed the job of locating Planet X
to Clyde Tombaugh, a 23-year-old Kansas man who had just arrived at the Lowell
Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical
drawings. [23]

Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of
photographs taken two weeks apart, then examine each pair and determine
whether any objects had shifted position. Using a machine called a blink
comparator, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the
plates, to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed
position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly
a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on
photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of that year. A lesser-
quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement.[24] After
the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the
discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13,
1930.[21]

### Name

The right to name the new object belonged to the Lowell Observatory. Tombaugh
urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else
did.[20] Name suggestions poured in from all over the world. Constance Lowell
proposed Zeus, then Lowell, and finally her own first name. These suggestions
were disregarded.[25]

The name Pluto was proposed by Venetia Burney (later Venetia Phair), an
eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England.[26] Venetia was interested in
classical mythology as well as astronomy, and considered the name, one of the
alternate names of Hades, the Greek god of the Underworld, appropriate for
such a presumably dark and cold world. She suggested it in a conversation with
her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian of Oxford University's
Bodleian Library. Madan passed the name to Professor Herbert Hall Turner, who
then cabled it to colleagues in America.[27]

The object was officially named on March 24, 1930.[28] Each member of the
Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three: "Minerva"
(which was already the name for an asteroid), "Cronus" (which had garnered a
bad reputation after being suggested by an unpopular astronomer named Thomas
Jefferson Jackson See), and Pluto. Pluto received every vote.[29] The name was
announced on May 1, 1930.[26] Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia five
pounds as a reward.[26]

### Demise of Planet X

Percival Lowell

Size estimates for Pluto: Year Mass Notes  
1931 1 Earth Nicholson & Mayall[30]  
1948 .1 (1/10 Earth) Kuiper [31]  
1976 .01 (1/100 Earth) Cruikshank, Pilcher, & Morrison [32]  
1978 .002 (2/1,000 Earth) Christy & Harrington [33]  
Once found, Pluto's faintness and lack of a resolvable disc cast doubt on the
idea that it could be Lowell's Planet X. Throughout the mid-20th century,
estimates of Pluto's mass were often revised downward. In 1978, the discovery
of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first
time. Its mass, roughly 0.2 percent that of the Earth, was far too small to
account for the discrepancies in Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternate
Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington,[34] failed. In 1993, Myles
Standish used data from Voyager 2's 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised
the planet's total mass downward by 0.5 percent, to recalculate its
gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the
discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished.[35] Today the
overwhelming consensus among astronomers is that Planet X, as Lowell defined
it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's position in
1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual position at that time; however,
Ernest W. Brown concluded almost immediately that this was a coincidence, a
view still held today.[36]

### Nomenclature

The name Pluto was intended to evoke the initials of the astronomer Percival
Lowell, a desire echoed in the P-L monogram that is Pluto's astronomical
symbol (â).[37] Pluto's astrological symbol resembles that of Neptune
(<IMG>), but has a circle in place of the middle prong of the trident (<IMG>).
(See also Pluto (mythology))

The Disney character Pluto, introduced in 1930, was named in the object's
honour.[38] In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element
plutonium after Pluto, in keeping with the tradition of naming elements after
newly discovered planets, such as uranium, which was named after Uranus, and
neptunium which was named after Neptune.[39]

In Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Korean the name was translated as
underworld king star (å¥çæ),[40][41] as suggested by Houei Nojiri in
1930.[42] Many other non-European languages use a transliteration of "Pluto"
as their name for the object; however, some Indian languages may use a form of
Yama, the Guardian of Hell in Hindu mythology, such as the Gujarati
Yamdev.[40]

## Physical characteristics

Pluto's distance from Earth makes in-depth investigation difficult. Many
details about Pluto will remain unknown until 2015, when the New Horizons
spacecraft is expected to arrive there.[43]

### Appearance

Pluto's apparent magnitude averages 15.1, brightening to 13.65 at
perihelion.[5] To see it, a telescope is required; around 30 cm (12 in)
aperture being desirable.[44] It looks indistinct and star-like even in very
large telescopes because its angular diameter is only 0.11". Its surface is
light brown with a very slight tint of yellow.[45]

Spectroscopic analysis of Pluto's surface reveals it to be composed of more
than 98 percent nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon
monoxide.[46][47] Distance and current limits on telescope technology make it
impossible to directly photograph surface details on Pluto. Images from the
Hubble Space Telescope barely show any distinguishable surface definitions or
markings.[48]

Some images of Pluto are derived from brightness maps created from close
observations of eclipses by its largest moon, Charon. Using computer
processing, observations are made in brightness factors as Pluto is eclipsed
by Charon. For example, eclipsing a bright spot on Pluto makes a bigger total
brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot. Using this technique, one can
measure the total average brightness of the Pluto-Charon system and track
changes in brightness over time.[49] Maps composed by the Hubble Space
Telescope reveal that Pluto's surface is remarkably heterogeneous, a fact also
evidenced by its lightcurve and by periodic variations in its infrared
spectra. The face of Pluto oriented toward Charon contains more methane ice,
while the opposite face contains more nitrogen and carbon monoxide ice. [50]

### Structure

Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope place Pluto's density at between
1.8 and 2.1 g/cmÂ³, suggesting its internal composition consists of roughly
50â70 percent rock and 30â50 percent ice by mass.[47] Because decay of
radioactive minerals would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to
separate from them, scientists expect that Pluto's internal structure is
differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense core
surrounded by a mantle of ice. The diameter of the core should be around 1,700
km, 70% of Pluto's diameter.[51] It is possible that such heating continues
today, creating a subsurface ocean layer of liquid water some 100 to 180 km
thick at the coreâmantle boundary.[51][52] The DLR Institute of Planetary
Research calculated that Pluto's density-to-radius ratio lies in a transition
zone, along with Neptune's moon Triton, between icy satellites like the mid-
sized moons of Uranus and Saturn, and rocky satellites such as Jupiter's
Europa.[53]

### Mass and size

<IMG>

<IMG>

Pluto's volume is about 0.66% that of Earth

Pluto's mass is 1.31Ã1022 kg; less than 0.24 percent that of the Earth,[54]
while its diameter is roughly 2,390 km, or roughly 70% that of the Moon.[55]
Astronomers, assuming Pluto to be Lowell's Planet X, initially calculated its
mass on the basis of its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus. In 1955 Pluto
was calculated to be roughly the mass of the Earth, with further calculations
in 1971 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars.[56] However, in 1976,
Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the University of Hawaii
calculated Pluto's albedo for the first time, finding that it matched that for
methane ice; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size
and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of the Earth.[56][57]

The discovery of Pluto's satellite Charon in 1978 enabled a determination of
the mass of the PlutoâCharon system by application of Newton's formulation
of Kepler's third law. Once Charon's gravitational effect was measured,
Pluto's true mass could be determined. Observations of Pluto in occultation
with Charon allowed scientists to establish Pluto's diameter, while the
invention of adaptive optics allowed them to determine its shape
accurately.[58]

Among the objects of the Solar System, Pluto smaller and much less massive
than the terrestrial planets, and at less than 0.2 lunar masses it is also
less massive than seven moons: Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Io, Earth's Moon,
Europa and Triton. Pluto is more than twice the diameter and a dozen times the
mass of the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt.
However, it is smaller than the dwarf planet Eris, a trans-Neptunian object
discovered in 2005.

### Atmosphere

Main article: Atmosphere of Pluto

<IMG>

<IMG>

Artist's concept of Charon seen through the tenuous atmosphere of Pluto.

Pluto's atmosphere consists of a thin envelope of nitrogen, methane, and
carbon monoxide, derived from the ices on its surface.[59] As Pluto moves away
from the Sun, its atmosphere gradually freezes and falls to the ground. As it
edges closer to the Sun, the temperature of Pluto's solid surface increases,
causing the ices to sublimate into gas. This creates an anti-greenhouse
effect; much like sweat cools the body as it evaporates from the surface of
the skin, this sublimation has a cooling effect on the surface of Pluto.
Scientists using the Submillimeter Array have recently discovered that Pluto's
temperature is about 43 K (â230 Â°C), 10 K colder than expected.[60]

Pluto was found to have an atmosphere from an occultation observation in 1985;
the finding was confirmed and significantly strengthened by extensive
observations of another occultation in 1988. When an object with no atmosphere
occults a star, the star abruptly disappears; in the case of Pluto, the star
dimmed out gradually.[61] From the rate of dimming, the atmospheric pressure
was determined to be 0.15 pascal, roughly 1/700,000 that of Earth.[62]

In 2002, another occultation of a star by Pluto was observed and analysed by
teams led by Bruno Sicardy of the Paris Observatory,[63] James L. Elliot of
MIT,[64] and Jay Pasachoff of Williams College.[65] The atmospheric pressure
was estimated to be 0.3 pascal, even though Pluto was farther from the Sun
than in 1988 and thus should have been colder and had a more rarefied
atmosphere. One explanation for the discrepancy is that in 1987 the south pole
of Pluto came out of shadow for the first time in 120 years, causing extra
nitrogen to sublimate from the polar cap. It will take decades for the excess
nitrogen to condense out of the atmosphere.[66] Another stellar occultation
was observed by the MIT-Williams College team of James Elliot, Jay Pasachoff,
and a Southwest Research Institute team led by Leslie Young on June 12, 2006
from sites in Australia.[67]

In October 2006, Dale Cruikshank of NASA/Ames Research Center (a New Horizons
co-investigator) and his colleagues announced the spectroscopic discovery of
ethane on Pluto's surface. This ethane is produced from the photolysis or
radiolysis (i.e., the chemical conversion driven by sunlight and charged
particles) of frozen methane on Pluto's surface and suspended in its
atmosphere.[68]

## Orbit

<IMG>

<IMG>

horizontal

<IMG>

<IMG>

This diagram shows the relative positions of Pluto (red) and Neptune (blue) on
selected dates. The size of Neptune and Pluto is depicted as inversely
proportional to the distance between them to emphasise the closest approach in
1896.

Pluto's orbit is different from those of the planets. The planets all orbit
the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic and have nearly
circular orbits. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is highly inclined relative to the
ecliptic (over 17Â°) and highly eccentric (elliptical). This high eccentricity
leads to a small region of Pluto's orbit lying closer to the Sun than
Neptune's. Pluto was last interior to Neptune's orbit between February 7, 1979
and February 11, 1999. Detailed calculations indicate that the previous such
occurrence lasted only fourteen years, from July 11, 1735 to September 15,
1749, whereas between April 30, 1483 and July 23, 1503, it had also lasted 20
years.

Although this repeating pattern may suggest a regular structure, in the long
term Pluto's orbit is in fact chaotic. While computer simulations can be used
to predict its position for several million years (both forward and backward
in time), after intervals longer than the Lyapunov time of 10â20 million
years, it is impossible to determine exactly where Pluto will be because its
position becomes too sensitive to unmeasurably small details of the present
state of the solar system.[69][70] For example, at any specific time many
millions of years from now, Pluto may be at aphelion or perihelion (or
anywhere in between), with no way for us to predict which. This does not mean
that the orbit of Pluto itself is unstable, however, only that its position
along that orbit is impossible to determine far into the future. In fact,
several resonances and other dynamical effects keep Pluto's orbit stable, safe
from planetary collision or scattering.

### Relationship with Neptune

<IMG>

<IMG>

Major Solar system bodies in resonance with Neptune

<IMG>

<IMG>

Orbit of Plutoâpolar view. This 'view from above' shows how Pluto's orbit
(in red) is less circular than Neptune's (in blue), and how Pluto is sometimes
closer to the Sun than Neptune. The darker halves of both orbits show where
they pass below the plane of the ecliptic.

Despite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from
directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never
collide or even approach closely. Several factors contribute to this.

At the simplest level, one can examine the two orbits and see that they do not
intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's
orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above the ecliptic. This
means Pluto's orbit actually passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune,
preventing a collision.[71][72][73] Pluto's ascending and descending nodes,
the points at which its orbit crosses the ecliptic, are currently separated
from Neptune's by over 21Â°.[74]

However, this alone is not enough to protect Pluto; perturbations from the
planets (especially Neptune) such as orbital precession would adjust Pluto's
orbit so that a collision could be possible over millions of years. Some other
mechanism or mechanisms must therefore be at work. The most significant of
these is that Pluto lies in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune: for
every three of Neptune's orbits around the Sun, Pluto makes two. The two
objects then return to their initial positions and the cycle repeats, each
cycle lasting about 500 years. This pattern is configured so that, in each
500-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion Neptune is over 50Â°
behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a
further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be a similar distance
ahead of Pluto. In fact, Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17 AU.
Pluto actually comes closer to Uranus (11 AU) than it does to Neptune.[73]

The 3:2 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable, and is preserved
over millions of years.[75] This prevents their orbits from changing relative
to one another; the cycle always repeats in the same way, and so the two
bodies can never pass near to each other. Thus, even if Pluto's orbit were not
highly inclined the two bodies could never collide.[73]

### Other factors

<IMG>

<IMG>

Diagram of the argument of perihelion

Numerical studies have shown that over periods of millions of years, the
general nature of the alignment between Pluto's and Neptune's orbits does not
change.[71][76] However, there are several other resonances and interactions
that govern the details of their relative motion, and enhance Pluto's
stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (in addition
to the 3:2 mean motion resonance).

First, Pluto's argument of perihelion, the angle between the point where it
crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun, librates
around 90Â°.[76] This means that when Pluto is nearest the Sun, it is at its
farthest above the plane of the solar system, preventing encounters with
Neptune. This is a direct consequence of the Kozai mechanism,[71] which
relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination, relative to a larger
perturbing bodyâin this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of
libration is 38Â°, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the
orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52Â° (= 90Â°â38Â°). The closest such
angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.[75]

Second, the longitudes of ascending node of the two bodiesâthe points where
they cross the eclipticâare in near-resonance with the above libration. When
the two longitudes are the sameâthat is, when one could draw a straight line
through both nodes and the SunâPluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90Â°, and
it comes closest to the Sun at its peak above Neptune's orbit. In other words,
when Pluto most closely intersects the plane of Neptune's orbit, it must be at
its farthest beyond it. This is known as the 1:1 superresonance, and is
controlled by all the Jovian planets.[71]

To understand the nature of the libration, imagine a polar point of view,
looking down on the ecliptic from a distant vantage point where the planets
orbit counter-clockwise. After passing the ascending node, Pluto is interior
to Neptune's orbit and moving faster, approaching Neptune from behind. The
strong gravitational pull between the two causes angular momentum to be
transferred to Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly
larger orbit, where it travels slightly slower, in accordance with Kepler's
third law. As its orbit changes, this has the gradual effect of changing the
pericentre and longitudes of Pluto (and, to a lesser degree, of Neptune).
After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune
sufficiently speeded up, that Neptune begins to catch Pluto at the opposite
side of its orbit (near the opposing node to where we began). The process is
then reversed, and Pluto loses angular momentum to Neptune, until Pluto is
sufficiently speeded up that it begins to catch Neptune once again at the
original node. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.[73][75]

Pluto has three known natural satellites: Charon, first identified in 1978 by
astronomer James Christy; and two smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, both
discovered in 2005.[77]

The Plutonian moons are unusually close to Pluto, compared to other observed
systems. Moons could potentially orbit Pluto up to 53% (or 69%, if retrograde)
of the Hill sphere radius, the stable gravitational zone of Pluto's influence.
For example, Psamathe orbits Neptune at 40% of the Hill radius. In the case of
Pluto, only the inner 3% of the zone is known to be occupied by satellites. In
the discoverersâ terms, the Plutonian system appears to be "highly compact
and largely empty."[78], although others have pointed out the possibility of
additional objects, including a small ring system. [79]

### Charon

Main article: Charon (moon)

The Pluto-Charon system is noteworthy for being the largest of the solar
system's few binary systems, defined as those whose barycentre lies above the
primary's surface (617 Patroclus is a smaller example).[80] This and the large
size of Charon relative to Pluto has led some astronomers to call it a dwarf
double planet.[81] The system is also unusual among planetary systems in that
each is tidally locked to the other: Charon always presents the same face to
Pluto, and Pluto always presents the same face to Charon. If one were standing
on Pluto's near side, Charon would hover in the sky without moving; if one
were to travel to the far side, one would never see Charon at all.[82] In
2007, observations by the Gemini Observatory of patches of ammonia hydrates
and water crystals on the surface of Charon suggested the presence of active
cryo-geysers.[83]

### Nix and Hydra

Main articles: Nix (moon) and Hydra (moon)

Two additional moons of Pluto were imaged by astronomers working with the
Hubble Space Telescope on May 15, 2005, and received provisional designations
of S/2005 P 1 and S/2005 P 2\. The International Astronomical Union officially
named Pluto's newest moons Nix (or Pluto II, the inner of the two moons,
formerly P 2) and Hydra (Pluto III, the outer moon, formerly P 1), on June 21,
2006.[84]

These small moons orbit Pluto at approximately two and three times the
distance of Charon: Nix at 48,700 kilometres and Hydra at 64,800 kilometres
from the barycenter of the system. They have nearly circular prograde orbits
in the same orbital plane as Charon, and are very close to (but not in) 4:1
and 6:1 mean motion orbital resonances with Charon.[85]

Observations of Nix and Hydra to determine individual characteristics are
ongoing. Hydra is sometimes brighter than Nix, suggesting either that it is
larger or that different parts of its surface may vary in brightness. Sizes
are estimated from albedos. The moons' spectral similarity to Charon suggests
a 35% albedo similar to Charon's; this value results in diameter estimates of
46 kilometres for Nix and 61 kilometres for the brighter Hydra. Upper limits
on their diameters can be estimated by assuming the 4% albedo of the darkest
Kuiper Belt objects; these bounds are 137 Â± 11 km and 167 Â± 10 km,
respectively. At the larger end of this range, the inferred masses are less
than 0.3% that of Charon, or 0.03% of Pluto's.[86]

The discovery of the two small moons suggests that Pluto may possess a
variable ring system. Small body impacts can create debris that can form into
planetary rings. Data from a deep optical survey by the Advanced Camera for
Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that no ring system is present.
If such a system exists, it is either tenuous like the rings of Jupiter or is
tightly confined to less than 1,000 km in width.[79]

Similar conclusions have been made from occultation studies. [87] In imaging
the Plutonian system, observations from Hubble placed limits on any additional
moons. With 90% confidence, no additional moons larger than 12 km (or a
maximum of 37 km with an albedo of 0.041) exist beyond the glare of Pluto 5
arcseconds from the dwarf planet. This assumes a Charon-like albedo of 0.38;
at a 50% confidence level the limit is 8 kilometres.[88]

Plot of known Kuiper belt objects, set against the four Gas giants

Pluto's origin and identity had long puzzled astronomers. One early hypothesis
was that Pluto was an escaped moon of Neptune, knocked out of orbit by its
largest current moon, Triton. This notion was heavily criticized because, as
explained by its orbit, Pluto never comes near the planet.[89]

Pluto's true place in the Solar System began to reveal itself only in 1992,
when astronomers found a population of small icy objects beyond Neptune that
were similar to Pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition. This
belt, known as the Kuiper belt after one of the astronomers who first
speculated on the nature of a trans-Neptunian population, is believed to be
the source of many short-period comets. Astronomers now believe Pluto to be
the largest[9] of the known Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Like other KBOs, Pluto
shares features with comets; for example, the solar wind is gradually blowing
Pluto's surface into space, in the manner of a comet.[90] If Pluto were placed
as near to the Sun as Earth, it would develop a tail, as comets do.[91]

Though Pluto is the largest of the Kuiper belt objects discovered so far,
Neptune's moon Triton, which is slightly larger than Pluto, is similar to it
both geologically and atmospherically, and is believed to be a captured Kuiper
belt object.[92] Eris (see below) is also larger than Pluto but is not
strictly considered a member of the Kuiper belt population. Rather, it is
considered a member of a linked population called the scattered disc.

A large number of Kuiper belt objects, like Pluto, possess a 3:2 orbital
resonance with Neptune. KBOs with this orbital resonance are called
"plutinos", after Pluto.[93]

## Formation

<IMG>

<IMG>

Pluto and Charon

Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is thought to be a residual
planetesimal; a component of the original protoplanetary disc around the Sun
that failed to fully coalesce into a fully-fledged planet. Most astronomers
agree that Pluto owes its current position to a sudden migration undergone by
Neptune early in the Solar System's formation. As Neptune migrated outward, it
approached the objects in the proto-Kuiper belt, setting one in orbit around
itself, which became its moon Triton, locking others into resonances and
knocking others into chaotic orbits. The objects in the scattered disc, a
dynamically unstable region beyond the Kuiper belt, are believed to have been
placed in their current positions by interactions with Neptune's migrating
resonances.[94] A 2004 computer model by Alessandro Morbidelli of the
Observatoire de la CÃ´te d'Azur in Nice suggested that the migration of
Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1:2
resonance between Jupiter and Saturn, which created a gravitational push that
propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch
places, ultimately doubling Neptune's distance from the Sun. The resultant
expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the Late
Heavy Bombardment 600 million years after the Solar System's formation and the
origin of Jupiter's Trojan asteroids.[95] It is possible that Pluto had a
near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune's migration
perturbed it into a resonant capture.[96] The Nice model requires that there
were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk;
these may have included the bodies which became Triton and Eris.[95]

## Exploration

Main article: New Horizons

First Pluto sighting from New Horizons

Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its small mass
and great distance from Earth. Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto, but
controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting
in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. Voyager 2 never had a
plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.[97] No serious attempt to explore
Pluto via spacecraft occurred until the last decade of the 20th century. In
August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle telephoned Pluto's discoverer, Clyde
Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. "I told him he was
welcome to it," Tombaugh later remembered, "though he's got to go one long,
cold trip."[98] Despite this early momentum, in 2000, NASA cancelled the Pluto
Kuiper Express mission, citing increasing costs and launch vehicle delays.[99]

After an intense political battle, a revised mission to Pluto, dubbed New
Horizons, was granted funding from the US government in 2003.[100] New
Horizons was launched successfully on January 19, 2006. The mission leader, S.
Alan Stern, confirmed that some of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, who died in
1997, had been placed aboard the spacecraft.[101]

In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter. Its closest
approach to Pluto will be on July 14, 2015; scientific observations of Pluto
will begin 5 months prior to closest approach and will continue for at least a
month after the encounter. New Horizons captured its first (distant) images of
Pluto in late September 2006, during a test of the Long Range Reconnaissance
Imager (LORRI).[102] The images, taken from a distance of approximately 4.2
billion kilometres, confirm the spacecraft's ability to track distant targets,
critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper Belt objects.

New Horizons will use a remote sensing package that includes imaging
instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as spectroscopic
and other experiments, to characterise the global geology and morphology of
Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition and analyse Pluto's
neutral atmosphere and its escape rate. New Horizons will also photograph the
surfaces of Pluto and Charon.

Discovery of moons Nix and Hydra may present unforeseen challenges for the
probe. Debris from collisions between Kuiper belt objects and the smaller
moons, with their relatively low escape velocities, may produce a tenuous
dusty ring. Were New Horizons to fly through such a ring system, there would
be an increased potential for micrometeoroid damage that could disable the
probe.[79]

## Classification

<IMG>

<IMG>

Pluto compared to Eris, Makemake, Haumea, Sedna, Orcus, Quaoar, and Varuna
compared to Earth (artist's impressions; no detailed photographs exist). The
objects are not to scale in relation to the latest size estimates. [103]

Since Pluto's place within the Kuiper belt was determined, its official status
as a planet has been controversial. Many have since questioned whether Pluto
should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding
population.

Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting
Pluto from planetary models of the solar system. Some omissions were
intentional; the Hayden Planetarium reopened after renovation in 2000 with a
model of only eight planets. The controversy made headlines at the time.[104]

In 2002, the KBO 50000 Quaoar was discovered, with a diameter then thought to
be roughly 1280 kilometres, about half that of Pluto.[105] In 2004, the
discoverers of 90377 Sedna placed an upper limit of 1800 km on its diameter,
nearer to Pluto's diameter of 2320 km,[106], although Sedna's diameter was
revised downward to less than 1600 km by 2007. [103] Just as Ceres eventually
lost its planet status after the discovery of the other asteroids, so, it was
argued, Pluto should be reclassified as one of the Kuiper belt objects.

On July 29, 2005, the discovery of a new Trans-Neptunian object was announced.
Named Eris, it is now known to be slightly larger than Pluto.[107] This was
the largest object discovered in the solar system since Triton in 1846. Its
discoverers and the press initially called it the "tenth planet", although
there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a
planet.[108] Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the
strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.[109]

Remaining distinguishing features of Pluto were its large moon, Charon, and
its atmosphere. These characteristics are probably not unique to Pluto:
several other Trans-Neptunian objects have satellites, and Eris's spectrum
suggests that its surface has a composition similar to Pluto's.[110] It also
possesses a moon, Dysnomia, discovered in September 2005.

### 2006: IAU classification

Main article: 2006 definition of planet

The debate came to a head in 2006 with an IAU resolution that created an
official definition for the term "planet". According to this resolution, there
are three main conditions for an object to be considered a 'planet':

  1. The object must be in orbit around the Sun.
  2. The object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape of hydrostatic equilibrium.
  3. It must have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.[111][112]

Pluto fails to meet the third condition, since its mass was only 0.07 times
that of the mass of the other objects in its orbit (Earth's mass, by contrast,
is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its own orbit).[113][114] The IAU
further resolved that Pluto be classified in the simultaneously created dwarf
planet category, and that it act as the prototype for the plutoid category of
trans-Neptunian objects, in which it would be separately, but concurrently,
classified.[115]

On September 13, 2006, the IAU included Pluto, Eris, and the Eridian moon
Dysnomia in their Minor Planet Catalogue, giving them the official minor
planet designations "(134340) Pluto", "(136199) Eris", and "(136199) Eris I
Dysnomia".[116] If Pluto had been given a minor planet name upon its
discovery, the number would have been a little over a thousand rather than
over 100,000. The first minor planet to be found after Pluto was 1164 Kobolda,
a month later.

There has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the
reclassification.[117][118][119] Alan Stern, principal investigator with
NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, has publicly derided the IAU resolution,
stating that "the definition stinks, for technical reasons."[120] Stern's
contention is that by the terms of the new definition Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be
excluded.[121] His other claim is that because less than five percent of
astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire
astronomical community.[121] Marc W. Buie of the Lowell observatory has voiced
his opinion on the new definition on his website and is one of the petitioners
against the definition.[122] Others have supported the IAU. Mike Brown, the
astronomer who discovered Eris, said "through this whole crazy circus-like
procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on. Itâs been a long time
coming. Science is self-correcting eventually, even when strong emotions are
involved."[123]

The ongoing debate over the status of Pluto continues to be acknowledged by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which, as recently as January 2008, continued to
reference it on JPL Photojournal webpages dedicated to Pluto.[124] Researchers
on both sides of the debate gathered on August 14-16, 2008 at The Johns
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for a conference that included
back-to-back talks on the current IAU definition of a planet.[125] Entitled
"The Great Planet Debate"[126], the conference published a post-conference
press release indicating that scientists could not come to a consensus about
the definition of a planet.[127] Just before the conference, on June 11, 2008,
the IAU announced in a press release that the term "plutoid" would henceforth
be used to describe Pluto and other objects similar to Pluto which have an
orbital semimajor axis greater than that of Neptune and enough mass to be of
near-spherical shape.[128][129][130]

### Public reaction to the change

<IMG>

<IMG>

Protesters of the reclassification of Pluto, with counter-protesters on a
different corner.

Reception to the IAU decision was mixed. While some accepted the
reclassification, others seek to overturn the decision with online petitions
urging the IAU to consider reinstatement. A resolution introduced by some
members of the California state assembly light-heartedly denounces the IAU for
"scientific heresy," among other crimes.[131] The U.S. state of New Mexico's
House of Representatives passed a resolution declaring that, in honour of
Tombaugh, a longtime resident of that state, Pluto will always be considered a
planet while in New Mexican skies, with March 13 being known as "Pluto Planet
Day".[132] The Illinois State Senate passed a similar resolution in 2009, on
the basis that Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, was born in Illinois,
and asserting that "unfairly downgraded to a 'dwarf' planet" by the IAU.[133]

Some reject the change for sentimental reasons, citing that they have always
known Pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of the IAU
decision.[134] Others view this rejection as an attempt to bend the rules in
order to keep the only planet discovered by an American classified as
such.[135]

### "Plutoed"

The verb "to pluto" (preterite and past participle: "plutoed") was a neologism
coined in the aftermath of its transtion from planet to dwarf planet in the
aftermath of the 2006 IAU decision. In January 2007, the American Dialect
Society chose "plutoed" as its 2006 Word of the Year, defining "to pluto" as
"to demote or devalue someone or something", "as happened to the former planet
Pluto when the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union
decided Pluto no longer met its definition of a planet."[136][137]

Society president Cleveland Evans stated the reason for the organization's
selection of "plutoed": "Our members believe the great emotional reaction of
the public to the demotion of Pluto shows the importance of Pluto as a name.
We may no longer believe in the Roman god Pluto, but we still have a sense of
connection with the former planet."[138]
