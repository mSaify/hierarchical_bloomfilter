Known objects in the Kuiper belt, derived from data from the Minor Planet
Center. Objects in the main belt are coloured green, while scattered objects
are coloured orange. The four outer planets are blue. Neptune's few known
Trojan asteroids are yellow, while Jupiter's are pink. The scattered objects
between the Sun and the Kuiper belt are known as centaurs. The scale is in
astronomical units. The pronounced gap at the bottom is due to obscuration by
the band of the Milky Way.

The Kuiper belt (pronounced /ËkaÉªpÉ/, to rhyme with "viper"),[1] sometimes
called the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt, is a region of the Solar System beyond the
planets extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 55 AU
from the Sun.[2] It is similar to the asteroid belt, although it is far larger
-- 20 times as wide and 20â200 times as massive.[3][4] Like the asteroid
belt, it consists mainly of small bodies (remnants from the Solar System's
formation). It is home to at least three dwarf planets â Pluto, Haumea and
Makemake. But while the asteroid belt is composed primarily of rock and metal,
the Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (dubbed
"ices"), such as methane, ammonia and water.

Since the first discovery in 1992, the number of known Kuiper belt objects
(KBOs) has increased to over a thousand, and more than 70 000 KBOs over 100 km
in diameter are believed to reside there.[5] The Kuiper belt was initially
believed to be the main repository for periodic comets, those with orbits
lasting less than 200 years. However, studies since the mid-1990s have shown
that the Kuiper belt is dynamically stable, and that it is the farther
scattered disc, a dynamically active region created by the outward motion of
Neptune 4.5 billion years ago, that is their true place of origin.[6]
Scattered disc objects such as Eris are KBO-like bodies with extremely large
orbits that take them as far as 100 AU from the Sun. The centaurs, comet-like
bodies that orbit among the gas giants, are believed to originate there.
Neptune's moon Triton is believed to be a captured KBO.[7] Pluto, a dwarf
planet, is the largest known member of the Kuiper belt. Originally considered
a planet, it is similar to many other objects of the Kuiper belt, and its
orbital period is identical to that of the KBOs known as "Plutinos".

The Kuiper belt should not be confused with the hypothesized Oort cloud, which
is a thousand times more distant. The objects within the Kuiper belt, together
with the members of the scattered disc and any potential Hills cloud or Oort
cloud objects, are collectively referred to as trans-Neptunian objects
(TNOs).[8]

## [edit] History

Since the discovery of Pluto, many have speculated that it might not be alone.
The region now called the Kuiper belt had been hypothesized in various forms
for decades. It was only in 1992 that the first direct evidence for its
existence was found. The number and variety of prior speculations on the
nature of the Kuiper belt have led to continued uncertainty as to who deserves
credit for first proposing it.

The first astronomer to suggest the existence of a trans-Neptunian population
was Frederick C. Leonard. In 1930, soon after Pluto's discovery, he pondered
whether it was "not likely that in Pluto there has come to light the first of
a series of ultra-Neptunian bodies, the remaining members of which still await
discovery but which are destined eventually to be detected".[9]

### [edit] Subsequent hypotheses

<IMG>

<IMG>

Astronomer Gerard Kuiper, after whom the Kuiper belt is named

In 1943, in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, Kenneth
Edgeworth hypothesised that, in the region beyond Neptune, the material within
the primordial solar nebula was too widely spaced to condense into planets,
and so rather condensed into a myriad of smaller bodies. From this he
concluded that âthe outer region of the solar system, beyond the orbits of
the planets, is occupied by a very large number of comparatively small
bodies"[10] and that, from time to time, one of their number "wanders from its
own sphere and appears as an occasional visitor to the inner solar
system,â[11] becoming a comet.

In 1951, in an article for the journal Astrophysics, Gerard Kuiper speculated
on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution,
however, he did not believe that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was
operating on the assumption common in his time, that Pluto was the size of the
Earth, and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or
out of the Solar System.[12]

The hypothesis took many other forms in the following decades: in 1962,
physicist Al G.W. Cameron postulated the existence of âa tremendous mass of
small material on the outskirts of the solar system,â[13] while in 1964,
Fred Whipple, who popularised the famous "dirty snowball" hypothesis for
cometary structure, thought that a "comet belt" might be massive enough to
cause the purported discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus that had sparked the
search for Planet X, or at the very least, to affect the orbits of known
comets.[14] Observation, however, ruled out this hypothesis.[13]

In 1977, Charles Kowal discovered 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with an orbit
between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator; the same device that
had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before.[15] In
1992, another object 5145 Pholus, was discovered in a similar orbit.[16]
Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, the centaurs, is known to
exist in the region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are
unstable over periods longer than roughly 100 million years, a relatively
short span when compared to the age of the Solar System. From the time of
Chiron's discovery, astronomers speculated that they therefore must be
frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.[17]

Further evidence for the belt's existence later emerged from the study of
comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As
they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate
into space, eating them gradually away. In order to still be visible over the
age of the Solar System, they must be frequently replenished.[18] One such
area of replenishment is the Oort cloud; the spherical swarm of comets
extending beyond 50 000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by astronomer Jan
Oort in 1950.[19] It is believed to be the point of origin for long period
comets, those, like Hale-Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.

There is however another comet population, known as short period or periodic
comets; those with orbits lasting less than 200 years. By the 1970s, the rate
at which short-period comets were being discovered was becoming increasingly
inconsistent with them having emerged solely from the Oort cloud.[20] For an
Oort cloud object to become a short-period comet, it would first have to be
captured by the giant planets. In 1980, in the Monthly Notices of the Royal
Astronomical Society, Julio Fernandez stated that for every short period comet
to be sent into the inner solar system from the Oort cloud, 600 would have to
be ejected into interstellar space. He speculated that a comet belt from
between 35 and 50 AU would be required to account for the observed number of
comets.[21] Following up on Fernandez's work, in 1988 the Canadian team of
Martin Duncan, Tom Quinn and Scott Tremaine ran a number of computer
simulations to determine if all observed comets could have arrived from the
Oort cloud. They found that the Oort cloud could not account for short-period
comets, particularly as short-period comets are clustered near the plane of
the Solar System, whereas Oort cloud comets tend to arrive from any point in
the sky. With a belt as Fernandez described it added to the formulations, the
simulations matched observations.[22] Reportedly because the words "Kuiper"
and "comet belt" appeared in the opening sentence of Fernandez's paper,
Tremaine named this region the "Kuiper belt."[23]

### [edit] Discovery

<IMG>

The array of telescopes atop Mauna Kea, with which the Kuiper belt was
discovered

In 1987, astronomer David Jewitt, then at MIT, became increasingly puzzled by
"the apparent emptiness of the outer Solar System."[24] He encouraged then-
graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object
beyond Pluto's orbit, because, as he told her, "If we don't, nobody will."[25]
Using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the
Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted
their search in much the same way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had,
with a blink comparator.[25] Initially, examination of each pair of plates
took about eight hours,[26] but the process was sped up with the arrival of
electronic Charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view
was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained
90 percent of the light that hit them, rather than the ten percent achieved by
photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, on a
computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical
detectors.[27] In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the
University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of
Hawaiiâs 2.24 m telescope at Mauna Kea.[28] Eventually, the field of view
for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be
conducted far more rapidly.[29] Finally, after five years of searching, on
August 30, 1992, Jewitt and Luu announced the "Discovery of the candidate
Kuiper belt object" (15760) 1992 QB1;[24] Six months later, they discovered a
second object in the region, 1993 FW.[30]

Studies since the trans-Neptunian region was first charted have shown that in
fact, the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin for
short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a separate but linked
population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when
Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was
much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically
stable objects which could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt
proper), and a separate population whose perihelia are close enough that
Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered
disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt
relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most
likely point of origin for periodic comets.[6]

### [edit] Name

Astronomers will sometimes use alternative name Edgeworth-Kuiper belt to
credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally referred to as EKOs. However,
Brian Marsden claims neither deserve true credit; "Neither Edgeworth or Kuiper
wrote about anything remotely like what we are now seeing, but Fred Whipple
did."[31] Conversely, David Jewitt comments that, "If anything . . . Fernandez
most nearly deserves the credit for predicting the Kuiper Belt."[12] The term
trans-Neptunian object (TNO) is recommended for objects in the belt by several
scientific groups because the term is less controversial than all others â
it is not a synonym though, as TNOs, include all objects orbiting the Sun past
the orbit of Neptune, not just those in the Kuiper belt.

## [edit] Origins

Kuiper belt, see Nice model.

The precise origins of the Kuiper belt and its complex structure are still
unclear, and astronomers are awaiting the completion of several wide-field
survey telescopes such as Pan-STARRS and the future LSST, which should reveal
many currently unknown KBOs. These surveys will provide data that will help
determine answers to these questions.[3]

The Kuiper belt is believed to consist of planetesimals; fragments from the
original protoplanetary disc around the Sun that failed to fully coalesce into
planets and instead formed into smaller bodies, the largest less than 3000 km
in diameter.

Modern computer simulations show the Kuiper belt to have been strongly
influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor
Neptune could have formed in situ beyond Saturn, as too little primordial
matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead,
these planets are believed to have formed closer to Jupiter, and migrated
outwards during the course of the Solar System's early evolution. Eventually,
the orbits shifted to the point where Jupiter and Saturn existed in an exact
2:1 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The
gravitational pull from such a resonance ultimately disrupted the orbits of
Uranus and Neptune, causing Neptune's orbit to move outward into the
primordial planetesimal disk, which sent the disk into temporary chaos.[32] As
Neptune traveled along this modified orbit, it excited and scattered many TNO
planetesimals into higher and more eccentric orbits, depleting the primordial
population.[33]

However, the present models still fail to account for many of the
characteristics of the distribution and, quoting one of the scientific
articles,[34] the problems "continue to challenge analytical techniques and
the fastest numerical modeling hardware and software".

## [edit] Structure

At its fullest extent, including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt
stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. However, the main body of the belt is
generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to
the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU.[35] The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with
the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic
plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times
farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt.[36] Its
mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.[37]

Orbit classification (schematic of semi-major axes)

The presence of Neptune has a profound effect on the Kuiper belt's structure
due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar
System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects which happen
to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System
or out into the Scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper
belt to possess pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood
gaps in the Asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance,
no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that
region must have migrated there relatively recently.[38]

### [edit] Classical belt

Main article: Classical Kuiper belt object

For details of the theory of the formation of the classical Kuiper belt, see
Nice model.

Between approximately 42â48 AU, however, the gravitational influence of
Neptune is negligible, and objects can exist with their orbits pretty much
unmolested. This region is known as the classical Kuiper belt, and its members
comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date.[39][40] Because the
first modern KBO discovered, 1992 QB1, is considered the prototype of this
group, classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos ("Q-B-1-os").[41][42]

The classical Kuiper belt appears to be a composite of two separate
populations. The first, known as "dynamically cold" population, has orbits
much like the planets; nearly circular, with an orbital eccentricity of less
than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10Â° (they lie
close to the plane of the Solar System rather than at an angle). The second,
the "dynamically hot" population, has orbits much more inclined to the
ecliptic, by up to 30Â°. The two populations have been named this way not
because of any major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles
in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up.[43]
The two populations not only possess different orbits, but different
compositions; the cold population is markedly redder than the hot, suggesting
it formed in a different region. The hot population is believed to have formed
near Jupiter, and to have been ejected out by movements among the gas giants.
The cold population, on the other hand, is believed to have formed more or
less in its current position although it may also have been later swept
outwards by Neptune during its migration.[3][44]

### [edit] Resonances

Main article: Resonant trans-Neptunian object

<IMG>

<IMG>

Distribution of cubewanos, plutinos and near scattered objects

When an object's orbital period is an exact ratio of Neptune's (a situation
called a mean motion resonance), then it can become locked in a synchronised
motion with Neptune and avoid being perturbed away if their relative
alignments are appropriate. If, for instance, an object is in just the right
kind of orbit so that it orbits the Sun two times for every three Neptune
orbits, then whenever it returns to its original position, Neptune will always
be half an orbit away from it, or in the same position as it began to it,
since it will have completed 1Â½ orbits in the same time. This is known as the
2:3 (or 3:2) resonance, and it corresponds to a characteristic semi-major axis
of about 39.4 AU. This 2:3 resonance is populated by about 200 known
objects,[45] including Pluto together with its moons. In recognition of this,
the other members of this family are known as Plutinos. Many Plutinos,
including Pluto, often have orbits which cross that of Neptune, though their
resonance means they can never collide. Many others, such as 90482 Orcus and
28978 Ixion, are large enough to likely qualify as plutoids when more is known
about them.[46][47] Plutinos have high orbital eccentricities, suggesting that
they are not native to their current positions but were instead thrown
haphazardly into their orbits by the migrating Neptune.[48] The 1:2 resonance
(whose objects complete half an orbit for each of Neptune's) corresponds to
semi-major axes of ~47.7AU, and is sparsely populated.[49] Its residents are
sometimes referred to as twotinos. Other resonances also exist at 3:4, 3:5,
4:7 and 2:5.[50] Neptune possesses a number of trojan objects, which occupy
its L4 and L5 points; gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing it
in its orbit. Neptune trojans are often described as being in a 1:1 resonance
with Neptune. Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits and are
unlikely to have been captured by Neptune, but rather to have formed alongside
it.[48]

Additionally, there is a relative absence of objects with semi-major axes
below 39 AU which cannot apparently be explained by the present resonances.
The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune
migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this
region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally
ejected from it.[51]

### [edit] "Kuiper cliff"

<IMG>

<IMG>

Graph showing the numbers of KBOs for a given distance from the Sun

The 1:2 resonance appears to be an edge beyond which few objects are known. It
is not clear whether it is actually the outer edge of the Classical belt or
just the beginning of a broad gap. Objects have been detected at the 2:5
resonance at roughly 55 AU, well outside the classical belt; however,
predictions of a large number of bodies in classical orbits between these
resonances have not been verified through observation.[48]

Earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested that the number of large
objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50 AU;[52] so this sudden
drastic falloff, known as the "Kuiper cliff", was completely unexpected, and
its cause, to date, is unknown. Bernstein and Trilling et al. have found
evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100 km or more in radius beyond
50 AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations
include that material at that distance is too scarce or too scattered to
accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed
those which did form.[53] Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University has claimed that
the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the
size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.[54][55]

## [edit] Composition

Studies of the Kuiper belt since its discovery have generally indicated that
its members are primarily composed of ices; a mixture of light hydrocarbons
(such as methane), ammonia, and water ice, a composition they share with
comets.[56] The temperature of the belt is only about 50K,[57] so many
compounds that would remain gaseous closer to the Sun are solid.

Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup
of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which
astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is spectroscopy.
When an object's light is broken into its component colours, an image akin to
a rainbow is formed. This image is called a spectrum. Different substances
absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific
object is unravelled, dark lines (called absorption lines) appear where the
substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every
element or compound has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading
an object's full spectral "fingerprint", astronomers can determine what it is
made of.

Initially, such detailed analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers
were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily
their colour.[58] These first data showed a broad range of colours among KBOs,
ranging from neutral grey to deep red.[59] This suggested that their surfaces
were composed of a wide range of compounds, from dirty ices to
hydrocarbons.[59] This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected
KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of their volatile ices to the
effects of cosmic rays.[60] Various solutions were suggested for this
discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing.[58] However,
Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001
found that the variation in colour was too extreme to be easily explained by
random impacts.[61]

Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due to their
faintness, there have been a number of successes in determining their
composition.[57] In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. obtained spectroscopic data
on the KBO 1993 SC, revealing its surface composition to be markedly similar
to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, possessing large amounts
of methane ice.[62]

Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including 1996 TO66,[63] 2000
EB173 and 2000 WR106.[64] In 2004, Mike Brown et al. determined the existence
of crystalline water ice and ammonia hydrate on one of the largest known KBOs,
50000 Quaoar. Both of these substances would have been destroyed over the age
of the solar system, suggesting that Quaoar had been recently resurfaced,
either by internal tectonic activity or by meteorite impacts.[57]

## [edit] Mass and size distribution

<IMG>

<IMG>

Illustration of the power law.

Despite its vast extent, the collective mass of the Kuiper belt is relatively
low. The upper limit to the total mass is estimated at roughly a tenth the
mass of the Earth,[3] with some estimates placing it at a thirtieth an Earth
mass.[65] Conversely, models of the Solar System's formation predict a
collective mass for the Kuiper belt of 30 Earth masses.[3] This missing >99%
of the mass can hardly be dismissed, as it is required for the accretion of
any KBOs larger than 100 km in diameter. At the current low density, these
objects simply should not exist. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of
current orbits makes the encounters quite "violent," resulting in destruction
rather than accretion. It appears that either the current residents of the
Kuiper belt have been created closer to the Sun or some mechanism dispersed
the original mass. Neptuneâs current influence is too weak to explain such a
massive "vacuuming", though the Nice model proposes that it could have been
the cause of mass removal in the past. While the question remains open, the
conjectures vary from a passing star scenario to grinding of smaller objects,
via collisions, into dust small enough to be affected by solar radiation.[66]

Bright objects are rare compared with the dominant dim population, as expected
from accretion models of origin, given that only some objects of a given size
would have grown further. This relationship N(D), the population expressed as
a function of the diameter, referred to as brightness slope, has been
confirmed by observations. The slope is inversely proportional to some power
of the diameter D.

     \\frac{d N}{d D} \\sim D^{-q} where the current measures[67] give q = 4 Â±0.5.
Less formally, there are for instance 8 (=2Â³) times more objects in 100â200
km range than objects in 200â400 km range. In other words, for every object
with the diameter of 1000 km there should be around 1000 (=10Â³) objects with
diameter of 100 km.

The law is expressed in this differential form rather than as a cumulative
cubic relationship, because only the middle part of the slope can be measured;
the law must break at smaller sizes, beyond the current measure.

Of course, only the magnitude is actually known, the size is inferred assuming
albedo (not a safe assumption for larger objects).  

## [edit] Largest KBOs

The relative sizes of the largest trans-Neptunian objects as compared to
Earth.

Since the year 2000, a number of KBOs with diameters of between 500 and 1200
km (about half that of Pluto) have been discovered. 50000 Quaoar, a classical
KBO discovered in 2002, is over 1200 km across. Makemake (originally (136472)
2005 FY9, nicknamed "Easterbunny") and Haumea (originally (136108) 2003 EL61,
nicknamed "Santa"), both announced on July 29, 2005, are larger still. Other
objects, such as 28978 Ixion (discovered in 2001) and 20000 Varuna (discovered
in 2000) measure roughly 500 km across.[3]

### [edit] Pluto

Main article: Pluto

The discovery of these large KBOs in similar orbits to Pluto led many to
conclude that, bar its relative size, Pluto was not particularly different
from other members of the Kuiper belt. Not only did these objects approach
Pluto in size, but many also possessed satellites, and were of similar
composition (methane and carbon monoxide have been found both on Pluto and on
the largest KBOs[3]). Ceres was considered a planet before the discovery of
its fellow asteroids.

The issue was brought to a head by the discovery of Eris, an object in the
scattered disc far beyond the Kuiper belt, that is now known to be 27 percent
more massive than Pluto.[68] In response, the International Astronomical Union
(IAU), was forced to define a planet for the first time, and in so doing
included in their definition that a planet must have "cleared the
neighbourhood around its orbit."[69] As Pluto shared its orbit with so many
KBOs, it was deemed not to have cleared its orbit, and was thus reclassified
from a planet to a member of the Kuiper belt.

Though Pluto is the largest KBO, a number of objects outside the Kuiper belt
which may have begun their lives as KBOs are larger. Eris is the most obvious
example, but Neptune's moon Triton, which, as explained above, is probably a
captured KBO, is also larger than Pluto.

As of 2008, only five objects in the Solar System, Ceres, Pluto, Eris,
Makemake and Haumea, are considered dwarf planets. However, a number of other
Kuiper belt objects are also large enough to be spherical and could be
classified as dwarf planets in the future.[70]

### [edit] Satellites

Of the four largest TNOs, three (Eris, Pluto, and Haumea) possess satellites,
and two have more than one. A higher percentage of the largest KBOs possess
satellites than the smaller objects in the Kuiper belt, suggesting that a
different formation mechanism was responsible.[71] There are also a high
number of binaries (two objects close enough in mass to be orbiting "each
other") in the Kuiper belt. The most notable example is the Pluto-Charon
binary, but it is estimated that over 1 percent of KBOs (a high percentage)
exist in binaries.[72]

## [edit] Scattered objects

Main articles: Scattered disc and Centaur (planetoid)

<IMG>

The orbits of objects in the scattered disc; the classical KBOs are blue,
while the 2:5 resonant objects are green.

The scattered disc is a sparsely populated region beyond the Kuiper belt,
extending as far as 100 AU and farther. Scattered disc objects (SDOs) travel
in highly elliptical orbits, usually also highly inclined to the ecliptic.
Most models of solar system formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in
a primordial comet belt, while later gravitational interactions, particularly
with Neptune, sent the objects spiraling outward; some into stable orbits (the
KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, becoming the scattered disc.[6] Due to
its unstable nature, the scattered disc is believed to be the point of origin
for many of the Solar System's short-period comets.[6]

According to the Minor Planet Center, which officially catalogues all trans-
Neptunian objects, a KBO, strictly speaking, is any object that orbits
exclusively within the defined Kuiper belt region regardless of origin or
composition. Objects found outside the belt are classed as scattered
objects.[73] However, in some scientific circles the term "Kuiper belt object"
has become synonymous with any icy planetoid native to the outer solar system
believed to have been part of that initial class, even if its orbit during the
bulk of solar system history has been beyond the Kuiper belt (e.g. in the
scattered disk region). They often describe scattered disc objects as
"scattered Kuiper belt objects."[74] Eris, the recently discovered object now
known to be larger than Pluto, is often referred to as a KBO, but is
technically an SDO. A consensus among astronomers as to the precise definition
of the Kuiper belt has yet to be reached, and this issue remains unresolved.

The centaurs, which are not normally considered part of the Kuiper belt, are
also believed to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they
were scattered inward, rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the
centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.[73]

### [edit] Triton

Neptune's moon Triton

During its period of migration, Neptune is thought to have captured one of the
larger KBOs and set it in orbit around itself. This is its moon Triton, which
is the only large moon in the Solar System to have a retrograde orbit; it
orbits in the opposite direction to Neptune's rotation. This suggests that,
unlike the large moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which are thought to have
coalesced from spinning discs of material encircling their young parent
planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding
space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy; it requires that some
force act upon the object to slow it down enough to be snared by the larger
object's gravity. How this happened to Triton is not well understood, though
it does suggest that Triton formed as part of a large population of similar
objects whose gravity could impede its motion enough to be captured.[75]
Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both
worlds shows that they are largely composed of similar materials, such as
methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was
once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.[76]

## [edit] Exploration

Main article: New Horizons

Artist's conception of New Horizons at Pluto

On January 19, 2006 the first spacecraft mission to explore the Kuiper belt,
New Horizons, was launched. The mission, headed by Alan Stern of the Southwest
Research Institute, will arrive at Pluto on July 14, 2015 and, circumstances
permitting, will continue on to study another as-yet undetermined KBO. Any KBO
chosen will be between 25 and 55 miles (40 to 90 km) in diameter and, ideally,
white or grey, to contrast with Pluto's reddish colour.[77] John Spencer, an
astronomer on the New Horizons mission team, says that no target for a post-
Pluto Kuiper belt encounter has yet been selected, as they are awaiting data
from the Pan-STARRS survey project to ensure as wide a field of options as
possible.[78] The Pan-STARRS project, due to come fully online by 2009,[79]
will survey the entire sky with four 1.4 gigapixel digital cameras to detect
any moving objects, from near-earth objects to KBOs.[80]

The debris disks around two stars (HD 139664 and HD 53143)

## [edit] Other Kuiper belts

Main article: Debris disk

As of 2006[update], astronomers have resolved dust disks believed to be Kuiper
belt-like structures around nine stars other than the Sun. They appear to fall
into two categories: wide belts, with radii of over 50 AU, and narrow belts
(like our own Kuiper belt) with diameters of between 20 and 30 AU and
relatively sharp boundaries. Most known debris discs around other stars are
fairly young, but the two images on the left, taken by the Hubble Space
Telescope in January, 2006, are old enough (roughly 300 million years) to have
settled into stable configurations. The left image is a "top view" of a wide
belt, and the right image is an "edge view" of a narrow belt. The black
central circle is produced by the camera's coronagraph which hides the central
star to allow the much fainter disks to be seen.[81][82] Beyond this, 15-20%
of solar-type stars have observed infrared excess which is believed to
indicate massive Kuiper Belt like structures.[83]
