Jamie Livingston (October 25, 1956 \- October 25, 1997) was a New York-based
photographer, film-maker and circus performer. Between March 31, 1979 and
October 25, 1997, the day of his death, he took a single picture nearly every
day with a Polaroid camera. [1][2]

Livingston's 'Polaroid a Day' photographic diary started at Bard College and
though some photos have gone missing from the collection, 6,697 Polaroids
remain. The collection, dated in sequence, has been organized by his friends
Hugh Crawford and Betsy Reid into an exhibit at the Bertelsmann Campus Center
at Bard College called "JAMIE LIVINGSTON. PHOTO OF THE DAY: 1979-1997", which
opened in 2007.[3]

## [edit] Biography

Livingston was a member of the musical, percussionist circus troupe Janus
Circus from Bard College. He also worked as a cinematographer and editor of
music videos for MTV, as well as working on advertisements with Nike. [4]

In 1979, Livingston received a Polaroid camera and after a few weeks noticed
that he was taking about one photo a day, which subsequently evolved into the
project.[5]

Livingston's Polaroid a Day charted his experiences with cancer, and his
subsequent engagement and marriage. His photographs in and out of hospital
continued up until the day of his death.[6]
