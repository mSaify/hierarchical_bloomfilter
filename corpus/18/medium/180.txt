## [edit] Biography

### [edit] Early life

Timbaland was born and raised in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Originally a disc
jockey known as "DJ Timmy Tim"[2] or "DJ Tiny Tim",[3] Mosley began making hip
hop backing tracks on a Casio keyboard. While in high school, Mosley began a
long term collaboration with rapper Melvin Barcliff, who performed under the
name of Magoo. The teenaged Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I.
- "Surrounded By Idiots" - which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell.[3]

Singer/rapper Missy Elliott heard his material and, taken by Mosleyâs unique
sense of rhythm, began working with him .[4] She and her R&B group Sista
auditioned for DeVante Swing, a producer and member of the successful R&B act
Jodeci. DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought
Mosley and Barcliff along with her to New York, where Swing Mob was based. It
was DeVante who renamed the young producer Timbaland, after Timberland
construction boots, which were popular in hip hop fashion.[5]

Sista, Timbaland, and Magoo became part of DeVante's stable of Swing Mob
signees known as "Da Bassment" crew, joining artists such as R&B singer
Ginuwine, male vocal group Playa (Smoke E. Digglera, Static Major and Digital
Black), and the girl group Sugah.[3] Timbaland did production work on a number
of projects with DeVante, including the 1995 Jodeci LP The Show, The After-
Party, The Hotel"the theme song to Seasame Street, and Sistaâs debut LP 4
All the Sistas Around the World, which was shelved and never released.

Elliott began receiving recognition as a songwriter for artists such as R&B
girl group 702 and MC Lyte. Due to Timbaland's connection with her, he was
often contacted to produce remixes of her songs. One of these, the remix to
702âs "Steelo" in 1996, became Timbalandâs first major production
credit.[6]

### [edit] 1996â1999

In 1996, Ginuwine released his debut album, Ginuwine...the Bachelor, which was
produced by Timbaland.[7] The album was both a commercial and critical
success.[7] On many of the tracks, Timbaland can be heard either rapping or
providing ad-libs, similar to what both Elliott and Puff Daddy were doing at
the time; Timbalandâs deep voice was usually vocoded to give it an
electronic sound.[7] While work was being completed on Ginuwine...the
Bachelor, R&B artist Aaliyah contacted Timbaland and Elliott to write and
produce songs for her second album, One in a Million.[8] The tracks that were
crafted for Aaliyah featured musical arrangements similar to those on
Ginuwine...the Bachelor.[8] One in a Million went on to sell over 11 million
copies worldwide.[9]

Asian instrumentation is present through much of his early work (Xscapeâs
"My Secret" remix, especially, with a sitar outro and Timbaland ad-libbing
"Letâs take a little trip...to India"), but was most successful and
prevalent with Jay-Zâs "Big Pimpin'" in 1999, which sampled directly from
Hossam Ramzy's "Khusara Khusara," a belly dance version of the song "Khosara"
originally made famous by Egyptian singer Abdel Halim Hafez in the 1950s.
Elliott's 2001 hit single, "Get Ur Freak On" from her third album, Miss E...So
Addictive, also used a speedy Tabla drumline typical of Hindustani classical
music. Nas' 1999 multi-platinum album I Am... was also partly produced by
Timbaland.[10]

### [edit] 2000â2002

Timbaland produced songs including Ludacris' "Roll Out (My Business)",[11]
Jay-Z's "Hola' Hovito",[12] Petey Pablo's "Raise Up",[13] and Beck's cover of
David Bowie's "Diamond Dogs" during this period.[14] He also contributed three
songs, all eventually released as singles, to Aaliyahâs self-titled third
album, the exotic lead single "We Need a Resolution" (featuring himself
rapping a verse), "More Than a Woman", and the ballad "I Care 4 U".[15]

Timbaland & Magooâs second album together was slated for release in November
2000. Indecent Proposal was to feature appearances by Beck, Aaliyah, as well
as new Timbaland protÃ©gÃ©s -- some from his new Beat Club Records imprint--
Ms. Jade, Kiley Dean, Sebastian, Petey Pablo, and Tweet (who was a member of
Sugah during the Swing Mob days). The album was delayed for an entire year,
finally released in November 2001. It was a commercial disappointment.
Beckâs vocals for the track "I Am Music" were not included on the final
version, which instead featured Timbaland singing alongside Steve "Static"
Garrett of Playa and Aaliyah.[16]

The first release on Beat Club was the debut album by Bubba Sparxxx in
September 2001, Dark Days, Bright Nights.[17] The loss of Aaliyah deeply
affected Timbaland, whose work was less omnipresent after 2001. In a phone
call to the MTV show Total Request Live, Timbaland said:

> She was like blood, and I lost blood. Me and her together had this
chemistry. I kinda lost half of my creativity to her. It's hard for me to talk
to the fans right now. Beyond the music, she was a brilliant person, the [most
special] person I ever met.

> âTimbaland, MTV[18]

### [edit] 2003â2005

Timbaland contributed three tracks to Tweetâs debut album, Southern
Hummingbird, and produced most of Elliottâs fourth and fifth LPs, Under
Construction and This Is Not A Test!.[19] He also produced tracks for artists
such as Lilâ Kim ("The Jump Off") and southern rapper Pastor Troy during
this period.[20] Collaborating with fellow producer Scott Storch, Timbaland
also worked on a number of tracks on former *NSYNC lead singer Justin
Timberlakeâs solo debut, Justified, including the song "Cry Me a River".[21]

Late in 2003, Timbaland delivered the second Bubba Sparxxx album, Deliverance,
and the third Timbaland & Magoo album, Under Construction, Part II. Both
albums were released to little fanfare or acclaim even though Deliverance was
praised by reviews and embraced by the internet community.[22]

Timbaland continued to produce hit singles and albums for artists; in 2004
Timbaland-produced singles by LL Cool J, Xzibit, Fatman Scoop, and Jay-Z
became staples on urban radio, and he produced the bulk of Brandyâs fourth
album, Afrodisiac.[23] The Timbaland-produced song "I'm So Fly" on Lloyd
Banksâs 2004 debut album The Hunger for More is significant in that it was
the first official Timbaland production bearing a co-production credit from
Danja, who would go on to become a requisite collaborator with Timbaland in
the future.[24]

Embracing an international audience, Timbaland co-wrote two tracks (Exodus '04
and Let Me Give You My Love) and produced three tracks of the bilingual
Japanese Pop star Utada Hikaruâs debut English album, Exodus.[25] He
continued working on tracks for Tweet and for Elliottâs sixth album, The
Cookbook: "Joy (feat. Mike Jones)", and "Partytime"[26] and continued to
expand his reach with production for The Game and Jennifer Lopez ("He'll Be
Back" from her fourth studio album, Rebirth.)[27]

### [edit] 2006â2007

Timbaland started a new label distributed by Interscope, Mosley Music Group,
bringing some talent from his former Beat Club Records label.[28] On the new
label are Nelly Furtado, Keri Hilson, and rapper D.O.E..[29] During 2006,
Timbaland had seven singles receiving airplay worldwide by Nelly Furtado and
Justin Timberlake. Additionally, Timbaland also appears in most of the
videos.[30]

In early 2007, Timbaland mentioned he wanted to work with female artist
Britney Spears on her album Blackout. However, Spears had refused. This came
during the time she was in a rehabilitation center in Malibu.

Timbaland provides vocals on the singles the Pussycat Dolls's "Wait a Minute",
Nelly Furtado's "Promiscuous" and "Ice Box" by Omarion, all of which climbed
the U.S. charts. In an interview published in August 2006 in the UK,[31]
Timbaland revealed he was working on a new LP by Jay-Z and that he had been
working on tracks with Coldplayâs Chris Martin.[32]

Timbaland worked on seven songs for BjÃ¶rkâs new album, including "Earth
Intruders", "Hope", and "Innocence",[33] and he later worked on tracks for the
new Duran Duran album, Red Carpet Massacre, including one featuring his
frequent collaborator Justin Timberlake.[34] Later in the year, Timbaland
produced songs for Bone Thugs N Harmony's LP, Strength & Loyalty[35] and the
song "Ayo Technology" on 50 Centâs album Curtis.[36] Timbaland also produced
most of the tracks on Ashlee Simpson's third CD, Bittersweet World, including
the song "Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)".[37]

On April 3, 2007, Timbaland released a collaboration album featuring artists
such as 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Elton John, Fall Out Boy, Nelly Furtado, Missy
Elliott, and others called Timbaland Presents Shock Value. The first single,
"Give It to Me" featuring Nelly Furtado and Timberlake, topped Billboardâs
Hot 100 chart and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop
Collaboration with Vocals.[38] The fourth single from the album, a remix of
the OneRepublic song "Apologize", was in the Billboard Hot 100 top ten for 25
weeks, the longest any song of the 2000s has spent in the top ten of the
chart.[39]

A rivalry flared up between Timbaland and record producer Scott Storch in
early 2007. The tension initially started on the single "Give It to Me", when
Timbaland anonymously called out Storch, rapping, "I'm a real producer and you
just the piano man". Timbaland confirmed that he was talking about Storch in
an interview with MTV personality Sway Calloway.[40] Storch responded with the
track "Built Like That" on February 26, 2007, featuring Philadelphia rapper
NOX, which caused a final response by Beat-Club-rapper D.O.E. on the song
"Piano Man". The end of the feud was confirmed by Timbaland in the final issue
of Scratch Magazine.[41]

On the 26 of November 2007, Timbaland and his then-fiancee Monique Idlett
became parents to a baby girl Reign.[42] Monique was also a publicist working
at Timbaland's Mosley Music Group record company.

### [edit] Plagiarism controversy

Main article: 2007 Timbaland plagiarism controversy

In early 2007, Timbaland was accused of plagiarism regarding his work on the
Nelly Furtado track "Do It". He is alleged to have plagiarized elements from
the song "Acid Jazzed Evening" by Finnish artist Tempest, without giving
credit or compensation.[43]

### [edit] 2008âpresent

In 2008, Timbaland helped produce many albums for various artists that include

Block" and Keshia ChantÃ©'s New Album.

On February 8, 2008, it was announced that Timbaland would be releasing an
album solely on a mobile platform for Verizon Wireless's V CAST cell phone
service and was designated its very first "Mobile Producer in Residence."
Timbaland will be joined by Mosley Music Group/Zone 4 singer/songwriter Keri
Hilson to begin work on the mobile albumâs first track aboard the fully
equipped Mobile Recording Studio. The only track to surface so far is "Get It
Girl". In his first effort within the video game industry, he is working with
Rockstar Games to produce Beaterator, a music mixing game for the PlayStation
Portable to be released in the summer of 2009.[46]

In reference to Timbaland's supposed musical "Midas touch," his name is heard
in a lyric of Weezer's 2008 single Pork and Beans. The line reads, "Timbaland
knows the way to reach the top of the charts. / Maybe if I work with him I can
perfect the art."

Timbaland postponed his Australian Shock Value tour which was originally set
for mid July to August . There has not been a press release and no reason has
been given. On August 22 Timbaland was scheduled to play at Melbourne's Rod
Laver Arena and on the same date The Coke Live Festival in Poland. Timbaland
has furthermore cancelled his Australian/New Zealand tour, and is suing the
promoter of the concert, "Showtime Touring" for failing to pay and tarnishing
his image by making it appear as if the concert didn't go ahead because of
personal reasons. Instead, it was because the company failed to make its
payments to Timbaland.

In September 2008 it was announced that Timbaland will receive the prestigious
honor of being inducted into the Philosophical Society of Trinity College,
Dublin as an Honorary Patron in October 2008. This award is over 300 years old
and one honoree is chosen every year for exceptional contributions to
society.[47]

Timbaland executive producing the movie âVinylâ which follows the lives of
5 young women facing life altering decisions about their relationships to
members of a rock band. Timbalandâs Mosley Media Group is teaming up with
Effie T. Brown's Duly Noted Inc. to create the movie. Marcus Spence, President
of Mosley Music, Timbalandâs wife and publicist Monique Idlett Mosley, will
be producing the film. Shooting starts in spring with Richard Zelniker at the
director's helm.[48]

Timbaland is working on Shock Value: Volume 2, alongside british singer Leona
Lewis,[49] due in 2009, his 5th studio album and follow-up to his platinum
album Shock Value in 2007.

Timbaland is working along side The X-Factor winner Alexandra Burke for her
debut album and the next single of the mexican actress Angelica Vale for her
world fame career.

In March 2009, he filed a lawsuit against his label, Blackground Records,
alleging that they attempted to blackball him after he decided to move from
music performance into production.[50]
