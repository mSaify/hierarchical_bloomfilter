Ratatouille is a 2007 computer-animated film produced by Pixar and distributed
by Walt Disney Pictures. The film was the eighth movie produced by Pixar, and
was directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. The title
refers to a French dish which is served late in the film, and is also a play
on words on the species of the main character.

The plot follows Remy, a rat who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to
achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage
boy. Ratatouille was released on June 29, 2007 in the United States, to both
critical acclaim and box office success, and later won an Academy Award for
Best Animated Feature, among other honors.

## [edit] Plot

Remy is an irregular rat who lives in the attic of a French country home with
his brother Emile and a pack led by his father Django. Gifted with a keen
sense of smell and taste, Remy aspires to be a gourmet chef, inspired by
France's recently deceased top chef, Auguste Gusteau, but instead he is put to
work sniffing for rat poison. When the pack is discovered by the home's
occupant, they flee into the sewers; Remy is separated and ends up aground
underneath Gusteau's restaurant in Paris.

Led by his imagination of Gusteau, Remy goes to the kitchen skylight to watch
the kitchen in action during a service. There, he observes Alfredo Linguini,
the son of Gusteau's former lover, being hired as a janitor by Skinner, the
restaurant's current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini
spills some of the soup and attempts to recreate it using random ingredients,
Remy is horrified and falls into the kitchen; instead of escaping, Remy
attempts to correct the soup. Remy is caught by Linguini just as Linguini is
caught by Skinner, but before anyone can stop the serving staff, the soup is
served and found to be a success. Colette, the staff's only female chef,
convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, believing him to be the success behind
the soup. Linguini takes Remy home, realizing he cannot kill him as instructed
by Skinner as Remy was the "little chef" that made the soup.

Remy discovers that he can control Linguini's movements by pulling on his
hair.

Remy and Linguini find a means to overcome their language barrier, with Remy
pulling Linguini's hair under his toque blanche to control his limbs like a
marionette. The two work together to successfully cook in the kitchen, even
overcoming challenges placed by Skinner. Skinner, suspicious of Linguini's
talents, discovers that Linguini is actually Gusteau's son and by Gusteau's
will, is the rightful owner of the restaurant; this revelation would ruin
Skinner's plans to use Gusteau's name to market a line of microwaveable meals.
Remy discovers Skinner's documents and retrieves them, bringing them to
Linguini, who subsequently fires Skinner and takes control of the restaurant,
much to the staff's delight. Linguini and Colette even begin to develop a
romantic bond, with Remy feeling that he is being left behind. Remy finds
Emile in the restaurant's trash, and is reunited with the pack. Django warns
Remy that humans and rats will never get along, but Remy insists that it will
all work out. Meanwhile, Remy begrudgingly feeds Emile and his growing group
of friends from the kitchen's pantry as the nights pass.

Anton Ego, a food critic that had cost Gusteau's one of its star ratings,
announces he will review the restaurant again the next day based on its rising
success. Linguini, under pressure of Ego's pending arrival, has a fallout with
Remy, causing Remy to retaliate by leading a raid on the kitchen's foodstocks
that night. Linguini catches the rats stealing the food and chases them all
out, including Remy, telling the rat he never wants to see him again. Remy,
dejected, is captured by Skinner who recognizes Remy was the real talent
behind Linguini, but is later freed by Django and Emile. Remy returns to the
kitchen to find a frantic Linguini apologizing for his actions, and asking
Remy back to help. Linguini then reveals the truth to the rest of the staff
about Remy, causing them all to walk out, but Colette later returns after
recalling Gusteau's motto: "Anyone can cook." Django, recognizing his son's
determination, organizes the rest of the pack to help out in the kitchen to
serve the other customers along with Linguini, while Remy and Colette work
together to prepare a variation on ratatouille for Ego. Ego is amazed by the
dish, bringing back memories of his mother's cooking, and asks to see the
chef. Linguini and Colette wait until all the other customers leave to reveal
Remy and the rats to Ego. Ego leaves the restaurant deep in thought, and
writes a glowing review of the meal the next day, declaring Remy to be
"nothing less than the finest chef in France".

Gusteau's restaurant is closed a short time later after a health inspector
discovered the rats in the kitchen. Though Ego's reputation is tarnished on
reviewing a restaurant plagued with rats, he eagerly funds a popular new
bistro, "La Ratatouille", run by Linguini and Colette, featuring diner areas
for both humans and rats and a kitchen designed for Remy to continue to cook
in.

## [edit] Production

Jan Pinkava came up with the concept and directed the film from 2001, creating
the original design, sets and characters and core storyline.[3] Lacking
confidence[4] in Pinkava's story development, Pixar management replaced him
with Bird in 2005.[5][6][7] Bird was attracted to the film because of the
outlandishness of the concept and the conflict that drove it: that kitchens
feared rats, yet a rat wanted to work in one.[8] Bird was also delighted that
the film could be made a highly physical comedy,[5] with the character of
Linguini providing endless fun for the animators.[9] Bird rewrote the story,
with a change in emphasis. He killed off Gusteau, gave larger roles to Skinner
and Colette,[10] and also changed the appearance of the rats to be less
anthropomorphic.[11]

Because Ratatouille is intended to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving
it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films,[5] director Brad Bird,
producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week in the city to properly
understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top
restaurants.[12] There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of
which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in
Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch
Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint Dept Coordinator Kesten Migdal) wearing a
chef uniform and apron jumped into Pixar's swimming pool to see which parts of
the suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water
absorption.[13]

### [edit] Food design

A challenge for the filmmakers was creating computer-generated food animations
that would appear delicious. Gourmet chefs in both the U.S. and France were
consulted [11] and animators attended cooking classes at San Francisco-area
culinary schools [14] to understand the workings of a commercial kitchen.
Sets/Layout Dept Manager Michael Warch, a culinary-academy trained
professional chef prior to working at Pixar, helped teach and consult
animators as they worked. He also prepared dishes used by the Art,
Shade/Paint, Effects and Sets Modeling Departments.[15][16] Celebrity chef
Thomas Keller allowed producer Brad Lewis to intern in his French Laundry
kitchen. For the film's climax, Keller designed a fancy, layered version of
the title dish for the rat characters to cook, which he called "confit byaldi"
in honor of the original Turkish name.[14] The same sub-surface light
scattering technique that was used on skin in The Incredibles was used on
fruits and vegetables,[17] while new programs gave an organic texture and
movement to the food.[18] Completing the illusion were music, dialogue, and
abstract imagery representing the characters' mental sensations while
appreciating food. The visual flavor metaphors were created by animator Michel
GagnÃ© inspired by the work of Oscar Fischinger and Norman McLaren.[19] To
create a realistic compost pile, the Art Department photographed fifteen
different kinds of produce, such as apples, berries, bananas, mushrooms,
oranges, broccoli, and lettuce, in the process of rotting.[20]

### [edit] Character design

According to Pixar designer Jason Deamer, "Most of the characters were
designed while Jan [Pinkava] was still directing... He has a real eye for
sculpture."[21] For example, according to Pinkava, the critic Anton Ego was
designed to resemble a vulture.[22] Rat expert Debbie Ducommun (a.k.a. the
"Rat Lady") was consulted on rat habits and characteristics.[23] A vivarium
containing pet rats sat in a hallway for more than a year so animators could
study the movement of the animals' fur, noses, ears, paws, and tails as they
ran.[17] The cast members strove to make their French accents authentic yet
understandable. John Ratzenberger notes that he often segued into an Italian
accent.[12]

To save time, human characters were designed and animated without toes.[24]

## [edit] Cast

### [edit] Main characters

  * Patton Oswalt as Remy, a country rat who winds up in Paris, where he fulfills his dream of cooking. Director Brad Bird chose Patton Oswalt to voice Remy after hearing his food-related comedy routine.[8]

  * Lou Romano as Alfredo Linguini, a clumsy garbage boy (plongeur) who becomes a famous chef, though Remy does the actual cooking. He is Gusteau's son. He slowly becomes friends with Colette, which later on turns into a relationship.

  * Janeane Garofalo as Collette Tatou, the only female chef in the kitchen, who eventually becomes Linguini's girlfriend and Remy's only other supporter.

  * Ian Holm as Skinner, the Napoleon-esque, Facel Vega-driving, owner of "Gusteau's" (after Gusteau's demise) and the main antagonist of the film. Skinner's behaviour, diminutive size, and body language are loosely based on Louis de FunÃ¨s.[25]

  * Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a feared, powerful food critic, whose earlier scathing review damaged Gusteau's culinary reputation and drove him to his death. He claims to love food, but refuses to eat any that does not match up to his lofty expectations. Ego's appearance was modelled after Louis Jouvet.[26]

  * Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a deceased master chef. He often appears as a figment of Remy's imagination, talking to him and acting much like his conscience. Many reviewers drew upon similarities between Gusteau and the real-life chef Bernard Loiseau, who committed suicide after media speculation that his flagship restaurant La CÃ´te d'Or was going to be downgraded from three Michelin stars to two.[27] La CÃ´te d'Or was one of the restaurants visited by Brad Bird and others in France.[12]

  * Brian Dennehy as Django, the father of Remy and Emile. He wants nothing more than for his son to stay with the colony, and has a bias against humans.

  * Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's older brother. He is loyal and good-hearted, though unimaginative, and is Remy's confidant. He also indiscriminately wolfs down anything that seems remotely edible, much to Remy's dismay. He is said to be easily impressed.

### [edit] Other characters

  * Will Arnett as Horst, Gusteau's German sous chef
  * Julius Callahan as Lalo, Gusteau's Nigerian saucier, and FranÃ§ois, Skinner's Indian advertising exec
  * James Remar as Larousse, a chef at Gusteau's
  * John Ratzenberger as Mustafa, Gusteau's head waiter
  * Teddy Newton as Talon Labarthe, Skinner's lawyer
  * Tony Fucile as Pompidou, a chef at Gusteau's, and the Health Inspector
  * Jake Steinfeld as Git, a former lab rat and member of Django's colony
  * Brad Bird as Ambrister Minion, Ego's Butler
  * StÃ©phane Roux as the narrator of the cooking channel
  * Thomas Keller, as a dining patron[14] (in the French version, the patron's voice is Guy Savoy's and in the Spanish version, it is Ferran Adria)
  * Jamie Oliver as the Inspector in the British version

## [edit] Music

Main article: Ratatouille (soundtrack)

Brad Bird reteamed Michael Giacchino on the score for Ratatouille since they
got along well during the scoring of The Incredibles. Giacchino had written
two themes for Remy, one about his thief self and the other about his hopes
and dreams. He also wrote a buddy theme for both Remy and Linguini that plays
when they're together. In addition to the score, Giacchino wrote the main
theme song, "Le Festin" which on Remy and his wishes to be a chef. Camille was
hired to perform "Le Festin" after Giacchino listened to her music and
realized she was perfect for the song. The music for Ratatouille gave
Giacchino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score as well
as his first Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album.

## [edit] Release

Ratatouille's world premiere was on June 22, 2007 at Los Angeles' Kodak
Theater. [28] The commercial release was one week later, with the Academy
Award nominated short film Lifted preceding Ratatouille in theaters.[29] A
special pre-release of the film was shown at the Harkins Cine Capri Theater in
Scottsdale, Arizona on June 16, 2007 at which a Pixar representative was
present to collect viewer feedback.

### [edit] Marketing

The trailer for Ratatouille debuted with the release of its immediate
predecessor, Cars. It depicts an original scene where Remy is caught on the
cheese trolley in the restaurant's dining area sampling the cheese and barely
escaping the establishment, intercut with separate scenes of the rat
explaining directly to the audience why he is taking such risks. Similar to
most of Pixar's teaser trailers, the scene was not present in the final film
release.

A second trailer was released on March 23, 2007.[30] The Ratatouille Big
Cheese Tour began on May 11, 2007, with cooking demonstrations and a film
preview.[31] Voice actor Lou Romano attended the San Francisco leg of the tour
for autograph signings.[32]

The front label of the planned Ratatouille wine to have been promoted by
Disney, Pixar, and Costco, and subsequently pulled for its use of a cartoon
character.

Disney and Pixar were working to bring a French-produced Ratatouille-branded
wine to Costco stores in August 2007, but abandoned plans because of
complaints from the California Wine Institute, citing standards in labeling
that restrict the use of cartoon characters to avoid attracting under-age
drinkers.[33]

In the United Kingdom, in place of releasing a theatrical trailer, a
theatrical commercial featuring Remy and Emile was released in cinemas prior
to its release to discourage obtaining pirated films.[34] Also in the United
Kingdom, the main characters were used for a theatrical commercial for the
Nissan Note, with Remy and Emile watching an original commercial for it made
for the "Surprisingly Spacious" ad campaign and also parodying it
respectively.[35]

Disney/Pixar were concerned that audiences, particularly children, would not
be familiar with the word "ratatouille" and its pronunciation. The title was
therefore also spelt phonetically within trailers and on posters.[36][37] For
similar reasons, in the American release of the film, on-screen text in French
was printed in English, such as the title of Gusteau's cookbook and the sign
telling kitchen staff to wash their hands, though in the British English
release, these are rendered in French. In Canada, the film was released with
on-screen text in English, but on DVD, all text (barring the opening and
closing credits) was in French.

### [edit] Blu-ray Disc & DVD release

Ratatouille was released on high-definition Blu-ray Disc and standard DVD in
North America on November 6, 2007.[38] One of the special features on the disc
is a new animated short film featuring Remy and Emile entitled Your Friend the
Rat, in which the two rats attempt to entreat the (human) viewer to welcome
rats as their friends, demonstrating the benefits and misconceptions of rats
towards humanity through several historical examples. The eleven minute short
uses 3D animation, 2D animation, live action and even stop motion animation, a
first for Pixar.[39]

The disc also includes a CG short entitled Lifted. It depicts an adolescent
extra-terrestrial attempting to abduct a sleeping human. Throughout the
sequence, he is graded by an adult extraterrestrial in a manner reminiscent of
a driver's licensing exam road test. The entire short contains no dialogue.

Also included among the special features deleted scenes, a featurette
featuring Brad Bird discussing filmmaking and Chef Thomas Keller discussing
culinary creativity entitled "Fine Food and Film", and four easter eggs.

### [edit] TV release

Ratatouille premiered on Disney Channel Asia August 27, 2008.

### [edit] Box office

In its domestic opening weekend, Ratatouille opened in 3,940 theaters and
debuted at #1 with $47 million,[40] the lowest Pixar opening since A Bug's
Life. However, in France, where the film is set, the film broke the record for
the biggest debut for an animated film.[41] In the UK, the film debuted at #1
with sales over Â£4million.[42] As of January 13, 2008 the film has grossed
$206,445,654 in North America and a total of $624,445,654 worldwide, making it
the third highest grossing Pixar film of all time, just behind Finding Nemo
and The Incredibles.[43]

### [edit] Critical reaction

Critical reaction to the film was almost unanimously positive. On film review
aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Ratatouille has a 96% rating from 203 reviews,[44]
while it has a Metacritic score of 96 based on 37 reviews, the seventh-highest
score of all on the website as of September 2008.[45]

Ratatouille was nominated for five Oscars including Best Animated Feature
Film, which it won. At the time, the film held the record for the greatest
number of Oscar nominations for a computer animated feature film, breaking the
previous record held by Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles at
four nominations, but tied with Aladdin for any animated film. In 2009, WALL-E
surpassed that record with 6 nominations. Beauty and the Beast still holds the
record for most Oscar nominations (also 6) for a traditionally animated film.

A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Ratatouille "a nearly flawless piece
of popular art, as well as one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist
ever committed to film" and ended his review with a simple "thank you" to the
creators of the film. [46] Both Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times and
Jeffrey Lyons from NBC's Reel Talk said in their reviews that they loved the
film so much, they are hoping for a sequel.[47][48] Reaction to the film in
France was also extremely positive.[49][50] Thomas Sotinel, film critic at the
daily newspaper Le Monde, hailed Ratatouille as "one of the greatest
gastronomic films in the history of cinema".[51] Several reviews noted that
Anton Ego's critique at the end of the movie could be taken, and at least in
one case was taken,[52] as "a slap on the wrist" for professional
critics.[53][54]
