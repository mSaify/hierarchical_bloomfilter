The MacBook is a brand of Macintosh notebook computers by Apple Inc. First
introduced in May 2006, it replaced the iBook and 12" PowerBook series of
notebooks as a part of the Apple Intel transition. Part of the MacBook family,
the MacBook is aimed at the education and consumer markets. It is the best-
selling Macintosh in history, and according to the sales-research organization
NPD Group in October 2008, the midrange model of the MacBook was the single
best-selling laptop of any brand in U.S. retail stores for the preceeding five
months.[1]

There are two designs of the MacBook: the first uses a polycarbonate casing
that was modeled after the iBook G4, while the second uses a unibody aluminum
casing. When the current MacBook was announced in October 2008, the original
polycarbonate based MacBook was renamed 'MacBook White'. Aside from the name
change, it received a standard SuperDrive, and later its chipset was updated
to the same one used in the current MacBook model.

## [edit] Polycarbonate model

The original MacBook in white

The original MacBook was released on May 16, 2006, and used the Intel Core Duo
processor and 945GM chipset, with Intel's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a
667MHz front side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo
processor and the GM 965 chipset, with Intel's X3100 integrated graphics on an
800MHz system bus.[2] An updated MacBook White with the same nVidia chipset
found in the aluminum model was released in January 2009. However, the new
model retains its DDR2 memory, whilst the aluminum uses DDR3.[3]

While thinner than the iBook G4 that it replaced, the MacBook was wider than
the 12-inch model due to its widescreen display. In addition, the MacBook was
the first to adopt Apple's MagSafe power connector and it replaced the iBook's
mini-VGA display port with a mini-DVI display port. The iBook's discrete
graphics chip was initially replaced by an integrated Intel GMA solution,
though the latest MacBook White now uses a nVidia GeForce 9400M graphics
solution.[3]

### [edit] Design of Polycarbonate model

While the MacBook largely followed the industrial design standard set by the
PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now
standard in its notebooks: the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design, and
the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard
received several changes to closely mirror the one that shipped with the iMac,
by adding the same keyboard shortcut to control multimedia, and removing the
embedded virtual numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.[4]

Also offered in a more expensive black model until the introduction of the
later aluminum MacBook, the polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh
notebook to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 (Clamshell).

### [edit] User serviceability

The polycarbonate Intel MacBook is easier for users to fix or upgrade than its
predecessor. Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access most
internal components, including removal of the keyboard and RAM[5], users need
only remove the polycarbonate MacBook's outer shell to access almost any
interior component. Replacing the hard drive and memory requires merely the
removal of the battery, and Apple provides do-it-yourself manuals for these
tasks.[6]

### [edit] Quality problems

Some early polycarbonate MacBook models suffered from include random
shutdowns, which were resolved through software and firmware updates.[7]

There were also cases reported of discolored palmrests. In such cases, Apple
asked affected owners to contact AppleCare.[8]

## [edit] Aluminum Unibody model

Apple announced the new MacBook with its new Nvidia chipset on October 14,
2008, at a Cupertino press conference called "The Spotlight Turns To
Notebooks". The chipset brought a 1066MHz system bus, use of DDR3 system
memory, and integrated NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics that is up to five times
faster than the Intel integrated graphics used by the white MacBook at the
time of introduction.[21] Other changes include an LED backlit display, a new
Mini DisplayPort (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a
multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button, removal of
toxins such as mercury, and the removal of the FireWire 400 port (thus it
doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system
repairs without booting the system).[22]

### [edit] Design of Aluminum Unibody model

The MacBook resembles the current MacBook Pro, but with smaller dimensions. It
is thinner than the original polycarbonate based MacBooks and makes use of a
unibody aluminum case with tapered edges. The keyboard of only the high-end
model is backlit, like that of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

### [edit] Reviews

Although Gizmodo concluded it to be "our favorite MacBook to date," they did
claim that its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and
MacBook Air, alleging a smaller viewing angle, washed-out colors, and dimmer
backlighting.[23] Similarly AppleInsider and Engadget concluded that it "may
well be Apple's best MacBook to date" and "these are terrific choices -- not
only from an industrial design standpoint, but in specs as well" respectively,
while also drawing attention to a lower quality display as compared with the
MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.[24][25] Charlie Sorrel of Wired News reached an
identical conclusion about the MacBook display, citing its poor contrast and
lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older
white MacBook.[26] Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the
FireWire port for Macworld, said "The absence of FireWire ports is certainly
an inconvenience for some users. But it shouldnât be considered a deal-
breaker for most of us, anyway."[27]
