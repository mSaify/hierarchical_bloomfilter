Chuck is an action-comedy television program from the United States created by
Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak. The series is about an "average computer-whiz-
next-door" who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now
working in the CIA; the message embeds the only remaining copy of the world's
greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.[1][2]

Produced by College Hill Pictures, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner
Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing
on Monday nights at 8PM/7c leading into Heroes.[3][4] On November 26, NBC
announced that Chuck received a full season pickup.[5] On February 13, 2008,
it was announced by NBC that Chuck had been picked up for a second season in
2008/2009.[6] The second season started on September 29, 2008, with a full
22-episode season order.[7] NBC released the first episode of season two a
week before its air date via multiple online distribution methods, and cable
on demand.

## [edit] Plot

Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) is a socially awkward twenty-something in
Burbank, CA who works as a computer expert at the Nerd Herd at his local Buy
More (a parody of Best Buy's Geek Squad),[8] a large retail consumer-
electronics chain, with his best friend, Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez). Chuck's
sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is a doctor who is constantly looking out for
his best interests and wants to help him find a girlfriend. Also joining the
cast is Ellie's fiance, Devon "Captain Awesome" Woodcomb (Ryan McPartlin),
also a doctor looking out for Chuck's social life. On the night of his
birthday party, Chuck receives an e-mail from his former Stanford University
roommate, Bryce Larkin (Matthew Bomer), who is now a "rogue" CIA agent. When
he opens it, the entire database of all the US government's secret information
â a neural supercomputer called The Intersect â is subliminally embedded
into his brain. Both the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence
Agency want the intelligence returned to them and dispatch agents of their own
â Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin) and Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) â
to retrieve the data.

Since the disk with the government information was stolen by Bryce and
destroyed in his attempted escape, and since Chuck experiences "flashes" of
information from the database activated by certain triggers around him (such
as faces, guns, watches, and other objects), he must use the knowledge he now
possesses to help the government thwart assassins and international terrorists
â upending his previously uneventful life. In order to preserve their
safety, Chuck must keep his new-found occupation a secret from his family and
friends, forcing Casey and Walker to establish an uneasy alliance and secret
identities; Walker poses as Chuck's girlfriend and takes a cover job at the
local restaurant next to the Buy More (formerly Wienerlicious, currently
Orange Orange) while Casey gets a job at the Buy More, with the shared goal of
protecting Chuck at all costs.

In the meantime, the government is in the process of rebuilding the Intersect
computer. As it nears completion, Casey is ordered to kill Chuck as soon as
the new Intersect is ready. However, in the premiere of season 2, it is
destroyed using a computer virus, keeping Chuck alive. As the series
progresses, it is revealed that Bryce is still alive and that a rival agency
called "Fulcrum" is in search of the Intersect, which they believed to still
be in the possession of Bryce, not Chuck. It is also discovered that Fulcrum
are the ones who destroyed the new Intersect. In the episode "Chuck vs. Santa
Claus" (season 2, episode 11, aired 12/15/08), a Fulcrum agent known as Mauser
discovers that it is Chuck, in fact, who is the Intersect. This discovery,
however, does not last long, as Sarah kills Agent Mauser before he is able to
notify anyone else in Fulcrum. (This sparks a subplot in the following episode
involving Chuck coming to terms with the shooting.)

In the episode "Chuck vs. The Suburbs" (2/16/09), the implant of all Fulcrum
secrets that Fulcrum had developed was implanted into Chuck's head.

## [edit] Production

### [edit] Conception

Josh Schwartz and newcomer Chris Fedak wrote the script for the first episode
which was initially given a put pilot commitment by NBC before a pilot order
was green lit by the network in January 2007.[9] Schwartz and Fedak both
attended the University of Southern California and the latter pitched the idea
to Schwartz who agreed to develop the project with him.[10] Joseph McGinty
Nichol, Schwartz's fellow executive producer on The O.C., directed the first
hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his
production company, Wonderland Sound and Vision. Fedak, Peter Johnson, Scott
Rosenbaum, Matthew Miller and Allison Adler also serve as co-executive
producers.[11] NBC gave the series an early pick-up and a thirteen-episode
order on May 10, 2007.[12] On November 26, 2007, TV Guide reported that NBC
had picked up the series for a full, 22 episode season.[13]

### [edit] Casting

Zachary Levi and Adam Baldwin were the first two to be cast in February 2007
in the roles of Chuck Bartowski and veteran NSA agent Major John Casey,
respectively. Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role of John Casey and
the producers found that the actor was a "perfect fit" for the character
during the first casting session.[10][14] Relative newcomer Yvonne Strahovski,
an Australian, was chosen for the female lead role of CIA officer Sarah Walker
in the same month.[15] Casting continued throughout March with Sarah
Lancaster, Joshua Gomez, and Natalie Martinez landing the parts of Dr. Ellie
Bartowski (Chuck's older sister), Morgan Pace (Chuck's best friend), and Kayla
Hart (Chuck's neighbor and love interest), respectively.[16] The Kayla Hart
character was dropped before filming because creators Chris Fedak and Josh
Schwartz found it unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women
would be pining over Chuck. Morgan's surname was later changed to "Grimes" and
Sarah's surname was changed to "Walker" as it was previously "Kent".[citation

### [edit] Broadcast history

Main article: List of Chuck episodes

The first showing of the pilot occurred on July 27, 2007 at Comic-Con
International in San Diego.[17] The series was originally slated to air on
Tuesday nights at 9PM/8c as announced at the 2007 Upfronts but this was later
changed to Monday nights at 8PM/7c as announced during the 2007 Television
Critics Association summer press tour. The season premiere aired on September
24, 2007 on NBC.[4][18] The pilot was leaked onto torrent websites on July 22,
2007.[19] All thirteen episodes produced before the 2007 Writers Guild of
America strike have aired. The last two episodes of the original thirteen
aired on January 24, 2008, with episode 12 airing at 8PM/7c and episode 13 at
10PM/9c, three days after they aired in Canada. Season Two premiered on
September 29, 2008. While the series originally had a 13 episode order, NBC
went ahead and ordered another nine, ensuring the series will get the full
22-episode treatment.[7] The theme song is Short Skirt/Long Jacket by Cake.

### [edit] Critical reception

Early reviews for Chuck were strong. Rolling Stone magazine included the show
on its Fall 2007 "We Like to Watch" list, saying the show "wipes the floor
with the other fall debuts."[24] Chuck landed on USA Today's list of the "10
Picks for 2007", and they called Levi's performance "incredibly winning",
giving the comedy three-out-of-four stars.[25][26] Chuck drew numerous
comparisons to another critically-acclaimed comedy that debuted in Fall 2007
â Reaper â which also starred a twenty-something underachiever who works
in a large retail, "big-box" store (Work Bench) and is drawn into heroism
against his will.[24][25][27][28]

As the year 2008 drew to a close, the show received further critical acclaim.
In December of that year Time magazine named the show one of the top 10 TV
series of the year.[29] It also made the year-end top 10 list of the Chicago
Tribune,[30] Television Without Pity's list of TV Shows We Wish More People
Watched,[31] The Star-Ledger's Top TV shows of 2008 (#4),[32] The Miami
Herald's TV's Top 5 list,[33] The New York Observer's Top 10 TV Shows of the
Year (#6),[34] and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette mentions Chuck as one of the
few bright spots in television in 2008.[35]

The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan wrote that "the show pays attention to the
mechanics of storytelling and doesn't just try to coast on the comedy." She
continued, "[Given] the level of attention paid to all those other
thingsâemotion, suspense, plotting, characterâChuck ends up being one of
the TV scene's greatest pleasures at the moment."[36] Television Without
Pity's Angel Cohn finds Chuck to be a well-written show, saying "it features
some of the smartest and most quick-witted dialogue on TV". He praises the
ensemble cast and notes "while the first season was good, this show has really
hit its stride in its second season."[37] James Poniewozik of Time magazine
says the show is a "delight" and that with the second season the "new episodes
quickly jump back in, with higher stakes and sharper jokes."[38] The Star-
Ledger's Alan Sepinwall states: "Chuck is the most purely entertaining show
currently on television, whether you're talking network or cable."[39]

### [edit] Awards

Season 1 of Chuck enjoyed much formal recognition. The program was mentioned
multiple times in IGN's 2007 year-in-review awards. Along with winning the
honor of Best New TV Series, Sarah Walker won the award for best TV character,
and Chuck and Sarah as a couple won the "Couple That We Rooted for the Most"
award. Chuck was also nominated for "Best New TV Comedy Series" at the 2008
People's Choice Awards, which aired on January 8, 2008, but lost to Samantha
Who?[40] The series stunt coordinator Merritt Yohnka won 2007 Primetime Emmy
for "Outstanding Stunt Coordination". Chuck was also nominated for
"Outstanding Main Title Design" that year, but didn't win.[41]

## [edit] Other media

### [edit] Marketing

In May 2007, NBC announced that their official website would launch "MyNBC"
allowing users to be more interactive with selected shows. MyNBC will allow
fans to delve inside Chuck's "brain" which will host hot spots of top-secret
government information that the title character possesses. It will also have
bonus video features.[42] In addition, NBC further announced in July 2007 that
tie-in micro websites where fans who log onto Buy-More.net would be directed
to NerdHerdHelp.com giving them access to exclusive content of the show and a
blog written by the title character's best friend and sidekick, Morgan, would
be launched in September 2007.[43] NBC is reportedly expected to spend about
$8 million in total promoting the show. [44]

### [edit] Comics

Wildstorm, a DC Comics imprint, will be producing a six-issue mini-series
written by Peter Johnson and Zev Borow (series co-executive producer and
writer, respectively), with art by Jeremy Haun and Phil Noto. It will start in
June 2008.[45][46][47] It also includes a public service announcement on
brushing one's teeth from Captain Awesome and two gag adventures with Morgan
based on film noir and The Odyssey.
