True Blood is an American television drama series created and produced by Alan
Ball. It is based on the Sookie Stackhouse book series (also known as The
Southern Vampire Mysteries) by Charlaine Harris. The show is broadcast on the
premium cable network HBO in the United States. It is produced by HBO in
association with Ball's production company, Your Face Goes Here
Entertainment.[1] It premiered on September 7, 2008. The show has been renewed
for a second 12-episode season, which will reportedly begin in June 2009.[2]

True Blood details the co-existence of vampires and humans in Bon Temps, a
fictional small northern Louisiana town. The series centers on Sookie
Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic waitress at a bar, who falls in love
with vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer).[1][3]

The series has been critically acclaimed and won several awards, including one
Golden Globe, for its first season.

## [edit] Production

### [edit] Development

Series creator Alan Ball had previously worked with premium cable channel HBO
on Six Feet Under, which ran for five seasons. In October 2005, after Six Feet
Under's finale, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and
produce original programming for the network. True Blood became the first
project under the deal, after Ball read the first book in Charlaine Harris'
Sookie Stackhouse series, Dead Until Dark.[4]

Ball was early for a dentist appointment one day when he was browsing through
Barnes and Noble and came across the book. Enjoying it, he continued reading
the series and halfway through the third entry, Club Dead, became interested
in "bringing Harris' vision to television."[4][5] Ball then contacted Harris
about adapting the material and both thought that television was the ideal
medium for the series. Ball has said, "The scope of Charlaine's books really
lent itself to a series more than just a movie â¦ [because I felt that
condensing] it into two hours would do it a disservice." Additionally, Harris
had previously been approached by others about adapting the books as a film,
but declined due to creative differences. She agreed to go work with Ball,
however, because she "became convinced that he understood the agenda of the
books â¦ and that he would do [them] justice."[5]

The project's hour-long pilot was ordered concurrently with the finalization
of the aforementioned development deal and was written, directed and produced
by Ball.[1][4] Cast members Paquin, Kwanten and Trammell were announced in
February 2007 and Moyer later on in April.[6][7] The pilot was shot in the
early summer of 2007 and was officially ordered to series in August, at which
point Ball had already written several more episodes.[1] Production on the
series began later that fall,[8] with Brook Kerr, who portrayed Tara Thornton
in the original pilot, being replaced by Rutina Wesley. Two more episodes of
the series had been filmed before the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike
shut production of the 12-episode first season down until 2008.

### [edit] Music

Gary Calamar, the music supervisor for the series, said his goal for the
soundtrack to the show that is to create something "swampy, bluesy and spooky"
and to feature local Louisiana musicians.[9]

Composer Nathan Barr writes the original score for the series which features
cello, guitar, prepared piano and glass harmonica among other instruments, all
of which he performs himself.[citation needed]

The main theme song is "Bad Things" by country music artist Jace Everett, from
his 2005 self-titled debut.[10].

### [edit] Viral marketing campaign

<IMG>

Promotional poster

The premiere of True Blood was prefaced with a viral marketing/ARG campaign,
based at BloodCopy.com. This included setting up multiple
websites,[11][12][13] encoding web address into unmarked envelopes mailed to
high profile blog writers and others, and even performances by a "vampire" who
attempted to reach out to others of their kind, to discuss the recent creation
of "TruBlood", a fictional beverage which is featured in the show.

A MySpace account with the username "Blood"[14] had, as of June 19, uploaded
two videos;[15] one entitled "Vampire Taste Test - Tru Blood vs Human",[16]
and one called "BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE".

A prequel comic was handed out to attendees of the 2008 Comic-Con. The comic
centers around an old vampire named Lamar, who tells the reader about how
TruBlood surfaced and was discussed between many vampires before going public.
At one point, Lamar wonders if TruBlood is making the world safe for vampires
or from them.

Several commercials featured on HBO and Facebook.com[17] aired prior to the
series premiere, placing vampires in ads similar to those of beer and wine.
Some beverage vending machines across the US were also fitted with cards
indication that they were "sold out" of TruBlood.

Thousands of DVDs of the first episode were handed out to attendees of
Midnight Madness, a special screenings event of the 2008 Toronto International
Film Festival.

Blockbuster Video provided free rental of the first episode of True Blood
several days before it was broadcast on HBO. The video had a faint promotional
watermark throughout the episode.

## [edit] Plot summary

Main article: List of True Blood episodes

Thanks to a Japanese scientist's invention of synthetic blood, vampires have
progressed from legendary monsters to fellow citizens overnight. And while
humans have supposedly been removed from the menu, many remain apprehensive
about these creatures "coming out of the coffin." Religious leaders and
government officials around the world have chosen their sides, but in the
small Louisiana town of Bon Temps, the jury is still out.

Local waitress Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), however, knows how it feels to
be an outcast. "Cursed" with the ability to listen in on people's thoughts,
she's also open-minded about the integration of vampires â particularly when
it comes to Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a handsome 173-year-old living up
the road. But as Sookie is drawn into a series of mysteries surrounding Bill's
arrival in Bon Temps, that tolerance will be put to the test.[18]

The first season's plot revolves around the murders of young women in the town
of Bon Temps. The likeliest suspect is Jason, Sookie's brother, who has had
sex with several of the victims and has developed an addiction to V-juice
(vampire blood). At first, Sookie wonders if her brother is guilty, but then
thinks he is not; at the urging of her grandmother, she begins to use her gift
to try to solve the mystery. As Sookie attempts this, her grandmother is also
murdered. Her boss, Sam, acts suspiciously and Bill, her vampire love
interest, is also a possible suspect. As Sookie investigates the murder, she
wavers between loving Bill the vampire, and her boss Sam. She finds out that
Sam is a shapeshifter and can turn into a dog.

The murderer turns out to be Rene, a man who works with Jason and frequents
the bar at which Sookie waits tables. He has been killing women he suspects of
sleeping with vampires, including his own sister. Sookie stumbles on to this
information after being driven home by the murderer. There is a chase during
which Sam the shapeshifter attacks Rene in dog form, and Bill the vampire goes
out in daylight to try and save Sookie, even though he nearly burns to death.
Both of these heroic efforts fail, and Sookie herself kills Rene with a shovel
left in the graveyard.

The season ends with the arrival of an immature vampire named Jessica, whom
Bill sired, coming to live with him against his wishes, and the discovery of a
body found in the car of local detective Andy Bellefleur. At the end of the
first season, the body has only been identified as an African-American with
brightly painted toe nails. It is likely, though not necessarily, that of
short-order cook, Lafayette Reynolds.

In a separate storyline, Tara, Sookie's best friend, begins a sexual
relationship with Sam. Tara is led to believe that she suffers from possible
demon contamination; she has been traumatized by her upbringing by an
alcoholic mother.

There is a brief encounter with the vampire hierarchy, including the sheriff
of area five (which includes Bon Temps), Eric, and his second-in-command, Pam.
In the last two episodes, a wealthy "social worker," who travels with a pig
and has an unrevealed secret power, enters the story.

## [edit] Reception

Clarify who said what about the show.  
The overall critical reception of True Blood has generally been favorable, but
initial impressions were mixed, ranging from overwhelmingly positive to very
negative. Many critics have praised the show for its originality, storytelling
and aesthetics; others have criticized it for being "muddled" and resorting to
stereotypes in its characterizations.[19]

## [edit] Ratings

True Blood debuted at a very modest 1.44 million viewers compared to the
network's past drama premiers such as Big Love which premiered at 4.56
million, and John from Cincinnati which debuted at 3.4 million.[20] However,
by late November 2008, 6.8 million a week were watching: this figure included
repeat and on-demand viewings.[21]The season finale's viewership was 2.4
million. True Blood has reportedly now become HBO's most popular series since
The Sopranos and Sex and the City.[22]
