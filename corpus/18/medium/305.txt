PhysX is a proprietary realtime physics engine middleware SDK originally
developed by Ageia (acquired by Nvidia in February 2008[1]) as the NovodeX
SDK. The term PhysX can also refer to the PPU add-in card designed by Ageia to
accelerate PhysX-enabled video games. Video games supporting hardware
acceleration by PhysX can be accelerated by either a PhysX PPU or a CUDA-
enabled GeForce GPU, thus offloading physics calculations from the CPU,
allowing it to perform other tasks instead - potentially resulting in a
smoother gaming experience.

Middleware physics engines allow game developers to avoid writing their own
code to handle the complex physics interactions possible in modern games.

The PhysX engine and SDK are available for the following:

  * Windows
  * Linux (32-bit)
  * Nintendo Wii[2]
  * Microsoft Xbox 360[3]
  * Sony Playstation 3[4][5]

Nvidia provides both the engine and SDK for free to Windows and Linux users
and developers[6]. The PlayStation 3 SDK is also freely available due to
Sony's blanket purchase agreement.

## [edit] Nvidia Acquisition

In February 2008, Nvidia bought Ageia and the PhysX engine and has begun
integrating it into its CUDA framework, which already has multiple drivers for
Linux, effectively rendering the PhysX add-in card redundant.[7] With Intel's
cancellation of Havok FX, PhysX is currently the only available solution for
physics hardware acceleration.[8]

In August 2008, Nvidia released drivers that allow GeForce 8 series and above
video cards to implement PhysX processing.[9]

## [edit] Hardware

### [edit] PPU

A physics processing unit (PPU) is a processor specially designed to alleviate
calculations from the CPU, specifically calculations involving physics. Soon
after the release of Ageia's PPU, graphics card manufacturers announced plans
to implement similar functionality via the GPU.

### [edit] GPU

A graphics processing unit or GPU (also occasionally called visual processing
unit or VPU) is a dedicated graphics rendering device for a personal computer,
workstation, or game console. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating
and displaying computer graphics, and their highly parallel structure makes
them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for a range of complex
algorithms such as accelerating physics using PhysX. A GPU can sit on top of a
video card, or it can be integrated directly into the motherboard. More than
90% of new desktop and notebook computers have integrated GPUs, which are
usually far less powerful than their add-in counterparts.

Any CUDA ready GeForce graphics cards, GeForce series 8 and newer, can take
advantage of PhysX without the need to install a dedicated PhysX card.

### [edit] PhysX P1 (PPU) hardware specifications

ASUS and BFG Technologies bought licenses to manufacture AGEIA's only hardware
PPU - the PhysX P1 w/ 128MB GDDR3.

  * Multi-core MIPS architecture based device with integrated physics acceleration hardware and memory subsystem with "tens of cores"[10]
  * 125 million transistors[11]
  * 182 mmÂ² die size
  * Memory: 128 MB GDDR3 RAM on 128-bit interface
  * Interface: 32-bit PCI 3.0
  * Sphere collision tests: 530 million per second (maximum capability)
  * Convex collision tests: 530,000 per second (maximum capability)
  * Peak Instruction Bandwidth: 20 billion per second
  * Peak Power Consumption: 30 W
  * Fabrication Process: 130 nm
  * Price: Between $100-$250 in the USA, Â£75-Â£145 (inc VAT) in the UK

## [edit] Competition

The major competitor to the PhysX SDK is the Havok SDK, which is used in more
than 150 games, including major titles like Half-Life 2 and Dead Rising.[12]
However, Havok does not currently support hardware physics acceleration. Since
Havok's take-over by Intel, AMD and Intel are now concentrating their
respective efforts on Havok physics for their respective platforms. ATI is now
in the works with Intel to use ATI Stream (equivalent of CUDA) to use Havok
through hardware.

## [edit] Title support

There are many titles that use the PhysX SDK, but not all include support for
PhysX hardware and instead only support Nvidia based GPUs.[13][14]
