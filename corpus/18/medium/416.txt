### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Mumblecore is an American independent film movement that arose in the early
2000s.[1][2] It is primarily characterized by ultra-low budget production
(often employing digital video cameras), focus on personal relationships
between twenty-somethings, improvised scripts, and non-professional actors.
Filmmakers in this genre include Lynn Shelton, Andrew Bujalski, Mark Duplass,
Jay Duplass, Aaron Katz, Joe Swanberg, Todd Rohal and Ry Russo-Young.[1][3]

The term "mumblecore" was coined by Eric Masunaga, a sound editor who has
worked with Bujalski. Masunaga coined the term one night at a bar during the
2005 South by Southwest Film Festival, but it was Bujalski who first used it
in an interview with indieWIRE.[2] The directors of the films are sometimes
referred to collectively as "mumblecorps," as in press corps. Film journalists
have also used the terms "bedhead cinema" and "Slackavetes," a reference to
independent film director John Cassavetes.[2]

The IFC Center in New York City exhibited a ten-film series of mumblecore
films in 2007, titled "The New Talkies: Generation D.I.Y."[2]

New York-based Benten Films, a boutique DVD label run by film critics, has
championed such mumblecore titles as Swanberg's LOL, and Katz's first two
films: Dance Party USA and Quiet City.
