The Eurovision Song Contest (French: Concours Eurovision de la Chanson)[1] is
an annual competition held among active member countries of the European
Broadcasting Union (EBU).

Each member country submits a song to be performed on live television and then
casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the most popular song
in the competition. Each country participates via one of their national EBU-
member television stations, whose task it is to select a singer and a song to
represent their country in the international competition.

The Contest has been broadcast every year since its inauguration in 1956 and
is one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. It is also
one of the most-watched non-sporting events in the world,[2] with audience
figures having been quoted in recent years as anything between 100 million and
600 million internationally.[3][4] Eurovision has also been broadcast outside
Europe to such places as Australia, Canada, Egypt, Hong Kong, India, Jordan,
New Zealand, South Korea and the USA, despite the fact that these countries do
not compete.[5] Since the year 2000, the Contest has also been broadcast over
the Internet,[6] with more than 74,000 people in almost 140 countries having
watched the 2006 edition online.[7]

Further information: History of the Eurovision Song Contest

In the 1950s, as a war-torn Europe rebuilt itself, the European Broadcasting
Union (EBU)âbased in Switzerlandâcame up with the idea of an international
song contest whereby countries would participate in one television programme,
to be transmitted simultaneously to all countries of the union. This was
conceived during a meeting in Monaco in 1955 by Marcel BezenÃ§on, a Frenchman
working for the EBU.[8] The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo
Music Festival held in Italy,[9] and was also seen as a technological
experiment in live television: in those days, it was a very ambitious project
to join many countries together in a wide-area international network.
Satellite television did not exist, and the so-called Eurovision Network
comprised a terrestrial microwave network.[10] The name "Eurovision" was first
used in relation to the EBU's network by British journalist George Campey in
the London Evening Standard in 1951.[11]

The first Contest was held in the town of Lugano, Switzerland, on 24 May 1956.
Seven countries participatedâeach submitting two songs, for a total of 14.
This was the only Contest in which more than one song per country was
performed: since 1957 all Contests have allowed one entry per country.[12] The
1956 Contest was won by the host nation, Switzerland.

The programme was first known as the "Eurovision Grand Prix". This "Grand
Prix" name was adopted by the Francophone countries, where the Contest became
known as "Le Grand-Prix Eurovision de la Chanson EuropÃ©enne".[13] The "Grand
Prix" has since been dropped and replaced with "Concours" (contest) in these
countries. The Eurovision Network is used to carry many news and sports
programmes internationally, among other specialised events organised by the
EBU.[14] However, the Song Contest has by far the highest profile of these
programmes, and has long since become synonymous with the name "Eurovision".

## [edit] Format

The format of the Contest has changed over the years, though the basic tenets
have always been thus: participant countries submit songs, which are performed
live in a television programme transmitted across the Eurovision Network by
the EBU simultaneously to all countries. A "country" as a participant is
represented by one television broadcaster from that country: typically, but
not always, that country's national public broadcasting organisation. The
programme is hosted by one of the participant countries, and the transmission
is sent from the auditorium in the host city. During this programme, after all
the songs have been performed, the countries then proceed to cast votes for
the other countries' songs: nations are not allowed to vote for their own
song. At the end of the programme, the winner is declared as the song with the
most points. The winner receives, simply, the prestige of having
wonâalthough it is usual for a trophy to be awarded to the winning
songwriters, and the winning country is invited to host the event the
following year.[12]

The programme is invariably opened by one or more presenters, welcoming
viewers to the show. Most host countries choose to capitalise on the
opportunity afforded them by hosting a programme with such a wide-ranging
international audience, and it is common to see the presentation interspersed
with video footage of scenes from the host nation, as if advertising for
tourism. Between the songs and the announcement of the voting an interval act
is performed, which can be any form of entertainment imaginable. Interval
entertainment has included such acts as The Wombles (1974)[15] and the first
international presentation of Riverdance (1994).[16]

The theme music played before and after the broadcasts of the Eurovision Song
Contest (and other Eurovision broadcasts) is the prelude to Marc-Antoine
Charpentier's Te Deum.[8]

The Eurovision Song Contest final is traditionally held on a spring Saturday
evening, at 19:00 UTC (20:00 BST, or 21:00 CEST). Usually one Saturday in May
is chosen, although the Contest has been held on a Thursday (in 1956) and as
early as March. Since 2004, due to the increasing number of eligible countries
which have wished to participate, qualifying roundsâknown as Semi
Finalsâhave been held 2â3 days before the final.

## [edit] Participation

Further information: List of countries in the Eurovision Song Contest

Eligible participants include Active Members (as opposed to Associate Members)
of the European Broadcasting Union. Active members are those whose states fall
within the European Broadcasting Area, or otherwise those who are members of
the Council of Europe.[17]

The European Broadcasting Area is defined by the International
Telecommunication Union:[18]

    The "European Broadcasting Area" is bounded on the west by the western boundary of Region 1, on the east by the meridian 40Â° East of Greenwich and on the south by the parallel 30Â° North so as to include the western part of the USSR, the northern part of Saudi Arabia and that part of those countries bordering the Mediterranean within these limits. In addition, Iraq, Jordan and that part of the territory of Turkey lying outside the above limits are included in the European Broadcasting Area.
The western boundary of Region 1 is a line drawn west of Iceland down the
centre of the Atlantic Ocean.[19]

Active members include broadcasting organisations whose transmissions are made
available to (virtually) all of the population of the country in which they
are based.[17]

If an EBU Active Member wishes to participate, they must fulfil conditions as
laid down by the rules of the Contest (of which a separate copy is drafted
annually). As of 2009, this includes the necessity to have broadcast the
previous year's programme within their country, and paid the EBU a
participation fee in advance of the deadline specified in the rules of the
Contest for the year in which they wish to participate.

Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within
the continent of Europe, despite the "Euro" in "Eurovision"ânor has it
anything to do with the European Union. Israel, a Middle Eastern country has
been involved since 1973. In 1980, Moroccoâa North African
countryâparticipated in the Contest.

Fifty-one countries have participated at least once. These are listed here
alongside the year in which they made their debut:

## [edit] Selection procedures

Each country must submit one song to represent them in any given year they
participate. The only exception to this was when each country submitted two
songs in the inaugural Contest. There is a rule which forbids any song being
entered which has been previously commercially released or broadcast in public
before a certain date relative to the Contest in question.[20] The purpose of
this rule is to ensure that only new songs are entered into the Contest, and
not existing successful songs of years gone by, which might give a country an
unfair advantage due to the fact that the song is already known and popular.

Countries may select their songs by any means they wish: whether it be an
internal decision made by the participating broadcaster, or a public contest
which allows the country's public to televote between several songs. The EBU
encourages broadcasters to use the public competition format, as this
generates more publicity for the Contest. These public selections are known as
national finals.

Some countries' national finals are as bigâif not biggerâthan the
international Eurovision Song Contest itself, involving many songs being
submitted to national semi-finals. The Swedish national final,
Melodifestivalen (literally, "The Melody Festival") includes 32 songs being
performed over four semi-finals, played to huge audiences in arenas around the
country, before the final show in Stockholm. This has become the highest-rated
programme of the year in Sweden by TV audience figures.[21] In Spain, the
reality show OperaciÃ³n Triunfo was inaugurated in 2002; the winners of the
first three seasons proceeded to represent the country at Eurovision.[22]

Whichever method is used to select the entry, the song's details must be
finalised and submitted to the EBU before a deadline some weeks before the
international Contest.

## [edit] Hosting

See also: List of host cities of the Eurovision Song Contest

Most of the expense of the Contest is covered by event sponsors and
contributions from the other participating nations. The Contest is considered
a unique showcase for promoting the host country as a tourist destination. In
the Summer of 2005, Ukraine abolished its normal visa requirements for
tourists to coincide with its hosting of the Contest.[23]

Preparations to host the Contest start a matter of weeks after a country wins,
and confirm to the EBU that they intend toâand have the capacity toâhost
the event. A host city is chosen (usually the capital, but not always), and a
suitable concert venue. The largest concert venue was a football stadium in
Copenhagen, Parken, which held an audience of approximately 38,000 people when
Denmark hosted the Contest in 2001.[12] The smallest town in which the Contest
has ever been held was Millstreet in County Cork, Ireland, which hosted the
show in 1993. The village had a population of 1,500[24]âalthough the Green
Glens Arena venue held considerably more audience members.[25]

It is always a consideration, when choosing a host city and venue, what hotel
and press facilities there are in the vicinity.[26] In Kiev 2005, hotel rooms
were scarce as the Contest organisers asked the Ukrainian government to put a
block on bookings they did not control themselves through official delegation
allocations or tour packages: this led to many people's hotel bookings being
cancelled.[27] The impact that the Contest has on the host city is inversely
proportional to its size: in Riga 2003, the city centre was virtually taken
over by Eurovision delegates as they spent their week in the Latvian capital.

## [edit] Eurovision Week

The term "Eurovision Week" is used to refer to the week during which the
Contest takes place. As it is a live show, the Eurovision Song Contest
requires the performers to have perfected their acts in rehearsals in order
for the big night to run smoothly. In addition to rehearsals in their home
countries, every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage
in the Eurovision auditorium. These rehearsals are held during the course of
several days before the Saturday show, and consequently the delegations arrive
in the host city many days before the event. This means, in turn, journalists
and fans are also present during the preceding days, and the events of
Eurovision last a lot longer than a few hours of television. A number of
officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and
shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying
people to and from the Contest venue.

Each participating broadcaster nominates a Head of Delegation, whose job it is
to coordinate the movements of the delegate members, and who acts as that
country's representative to the EBU in the host city.[20] Members of the
delegations include performers, lyricists, composers, official press officers
andâif an orchestra is used that year, and if the song requires oneâa
conductor. Also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may
supply their own commentary for their TV and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in
each country. The commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated
around the back of the arena behind the audience.

### [edit] Rehearsals and press conferences

<IMG>

Traditionally, delegations would arrive on the Sunday before the Contest, in
order to be present for rehearsals starting on the Monday morning. However,
with the introduction of the semi-finalâand therefore the resulting increase
in the number of countries taking partâsince 2004 the first rehearsals have
commenced during the week before Eurovision Week. The countries taking part in
the semi-final currently rehearse over four days from the first Thursday to
the Sunday, with two rehearsal periods allowed for each country. The countries
which have already directly qualified for the grand final rehearse on the
Monday and Tuesday of Eurovision Week.[28]

<IMG>

After each country has rehearsed, the delegation meets with the show's
artistic director in the video viewing room. Here, they watch the footage of
the rehearsal just performed, discussing camera angles, lighting and
choreography, in order to try to achieve maximum Ã¦sthetic effect on
television. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any special
requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host
broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference
where members of the accredited press may pose them questions.[28] The
rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds
its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A
printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press
conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to
journalists' pigeon-holes.

Before each of the semi-finals, one or more full dress rehearsals are held.
Since tickets to the live shows are often scarce, tickets are also sold in
order that the public may attend these dress rehearsals. Similarly, two or
more full dress rehearsals are held after all semi-finals are finished, before
the live transmission of the grand final on Saturday evening.

### [edit] Parties and Euroclub

On the Monday evening of Eurovision Week, a Mayor's Reception is traditionally
held, where the city administration hosts a celebration that Eurovision has
come to their city. This is usually held in a grand municipally-owned location
in the city centre. All delegations are invited, and the party is usually
accompanied by live music, complimentary food and drink andâin recent
yearsâfireworks.[29]

After the semi-final and grand final there are after-show parties, held either
in a facility in the venue complex or in another suitable location within the
city.

A Euroclub is held every night of the week; a Eurovision-themed nightclub, to
which all accredited personnel are invited.[30]

During the week many delegations have traditionally hosted their own parties
in addition to the officially-sponsored ones. However, in the new millennium
the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity
and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.[29]

## [edit] Voting

Further information: Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest

The voting systems used in the Contest have changed throughout the years. The
modern system has been in place since 1975, and is a positional voting system.
Countries award a set of points from 1 to 8, then 10 and finally 12 to other
songs in the competition â with the favourite song being awarded 12 points.

Historically, a country's set of votes was decided by an internal jury, but in
1997 five countries (Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the United
Kingdom) experimented with televoting, giving members of the public in those
countries the opportunity to vote en-masse for their favourite songs. The
experiment was a success,[31] and from 1998 onwards all countries were
encouraged to use televoting wherever possible. Back-up juries are still
utilised by each country, in the event of the televoting failure. Nowadays
members of the public may also vote by SMS, in addition to televoting.
Whichever method of voting is usedâjury, telephone or SMSâcountries may
not cast votes for their own songs. However, juries are to be brought back in
2009 following criticism about the fairness of public voting.[32] as many
countries, particurlary those on the east of Europe tend to vote for
neighbouring countries. For instance, last year Sweden awarded their 8, 10 and
12 points to Finland, Norway and Denmark.

### [edit] Presentation of votes

<IMG>

<IMG>

After the interval act is over, when all the points have been calculated, the
presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them
to announce the results of their vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were
made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for
the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. With the advent of
more reliable satellite networks, from 1994 onwards voting spokespeople have
appeared on camera from their respective countries to read out the votes.
Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson
standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country.
Spokespeople may also give a short message to the hosts and organisers
thanking them for the show before giving out their country's points, which has
become something of a tradition over the years.

Votes are read out in ascending order, culminating with the maximum 12 points.
The scores are repeated by the Contest's presenters in English and French,
which has given rise to the famous "douze points" exclamation when the host
repeats the top score in French.

From 1957 to 2003, countries were called in the same order in which the songs
had been presented. Since 2004, the order of the countries' announcements of
votes has changedâdue to the presence of the semi-final, and the fact that
non-participating countries could also vote. In 2004, the countries were
called in alphabetical order (according to their ISO codes).[33] In 2005, the
votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their
running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in
their own order of performance. Since 2006, a separate draw has been held to
determine the order in which countries would present their votes.[34]

From 1971 to 1973, each country sent two jurors, who were actually present at
the Contest venue and announced their votes as the camera was trained on them.
In 1973 one of the Swiss jurors made a great show of presenting his votes with
flamboyant gestures.[31] This system was retired for the next year.

In 1956 no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that
Switzerland had won. From 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a
physical scoreboard to the side of the stage. As digital graphic technology
progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an electronic
representation which could be displayed on the TV screen at the will of the
programme's director.[35]

In 2006 the EBU decided to conserve time during the broadcastâmuch of which
had been taken up with the announcement of every single pointâbecause there
was an ever-increasing number of countries voting. From then onwards, the
points from 1â7 were flashed up onto the screen automatically, and the
announcers only read out the 8, 10 and 12 points individually.[34]

The voting is presided over by the EBU scrutineer, who is responsible for
ensuring that all points are allocated correctly and in turn. The scrutineer
is notified in advance of the results of the last five countries in the
running-order of voting, to ensure that no foul play can take place in the
form of tactical voting; where for example a country could change its votes
after seeing how the trend has gone before them on the scoreboard.[36]

### [edit] Ties for first place

In 1969, a tie-break system had not yet been conceived, and four countries all
tied for first place based on their total numbers of points: France, Spain,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Since there was no predetermined set
of rules to decide the winner, all four countries were declared as winners.
This caused much discontent among most of the non-winning countries, and mass-
walkouts were threatened. Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Portugal did
not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the
previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.[31]

In the event of a tie for first place at the end of the evening, a count is
made of the total number of countries who awarded any points at all to each of
the tied countries; and the one who received points from the most other
countries is declared the winner. If the numbers are still tied, it is counted
how many sets of maximum marks (12 points) each country received. If there is
still a tie, the numbers of 10-point scores awarded are comparedâand then
the numbers of 8-points, all the way down the list. In the extremely unlikely
event of there then still being a tie for first place, the song performed
earliest in the running order is declared the winner. The same tie-break rule
now applies to ties for all places.[37]

As of 2009, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for
first place on total points alone was in 1991, when France and Sweden both
totalled 146 points. In 1991 the tie-break rules did not include counting the
numbers of countries awarding any points at all to these countries, but began
with tallying up the numbers of 12 points awarded. Both France and Sweden had
received four sets of 12 points. However, because Sweden had received more
sets of 10 points, they were declared the winners. Had the current rule been
in play, France would have won instead.[31]

## [edit] Rules

Further information: Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest

There are a number of rules which must be observed by the participating
nations. The rules are numerous and unabridged, and a separate draft is
produced each year, which explicitly specifies the dates by which certain
things must be done; for example the deadline by which all the participating
broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU.
Many rules pertain to such matters as sponsorship agreements and rights of
broadcasters to re-transmit the show within a certain time. The most notable
rules which actually affect the format and presentation of the Contest have
changed somewhat over the years, and are highlighted here.

### [edit] Hosting

In 1958 it was decided that from then on, the winning country would host the
Contest the next year.[12] The winner of the 1957 Contest was the Netherlands,
and Dutch television accepted the responsibility of hosting in 1958. In all
but five of the years since this rule has been in place, the winning country
has hosted the show the following year. The exceptions are:

  * 1960âhosted by the BBC in London when the Netherlands declined due to expense. The UK was chosen to host because it had come second in 1959.[31]
  * 1963âhosted by the BBC in London when France declined due to expense. Although the UK had only come fourth in 1962, Monaco and Luxembourg (who came second and third) had also declined.[31]
  * 1972âhosted by the BBC in Edinburgh when Monaco was unable to provide a suitable venue: Monegasque television invited the BBC to take over due to its previous experience.[31]
  * 1974âhosted by the BBC in Brighton when Luxembourg declined due to expense. The BBC was becoming known as the host by default, if the winning country declined.[15]
  * 1980âhosted by NOS in The Hague when the Israel Broadcasting Authority declined due to expense, and the fact that the date chosen for the Contest (19 April) was Israel's Remembrance Day that year. The Dutch offered to host the Contest after several other broadcasters (including the BBC) were unwilling to do so.[31]

The declinations due to expense were due to those broadcasters' already having
hosted the Contest during the past couple of years. Since 1981, all Contests
have been held in the country which won the previous year.

### [edit] Live music

All vocals must be sung live: no voices are permitted on backing tracks.[20]
In 1999, the Croatian song featured sounds on their backing track which
sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that
there were no human voices, but only digitally-synthesised sounds which
replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the
spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year as
used for calculating their five-year points average for future
qualification.[31]

From 1956 until 1998, it was necessary for the host country to provide a live
orchestra for the use of the participants. Prior to 1973, all music was
required to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded
backing tracks were permittedâalthough the host country was still obliged to
provide a live orchestra in order to give participants a choice. If a backing
track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to
be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.[31]

In 1999 the rules were amended to abolish the requirement by the host
broadcaster to provide a live orchestra, leaving it as an optional
contribution.[31] The host that year, Israel's IBA, decided not to use an
orchestra in order to save on expenses, and 1999 became the first year in
which all of the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in
conjunction with live vocals). The orchestra has not since made an appearance
at the Contest; the last time being in 1998 when the BBC hosted the show in
Birmingham.

### [edit] Language

Further Information: Language in the Eurovision Song Contest

The rule requiring countries to sing in their own national language has been
changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule
restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. However, in 1966 a
rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the
official languages of the country participating.[12]

The language restriction continued until 1973, when it was lifted and
performers were again free to sing in any language they wished.[12] Several
winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of the newly-found freedom, with
performers from non-native-English-speaking countries singing in English,
including ABBA in 1974.

In 1977, the EBU decided to revert to the national language restriction.[12]
However, special dispensation was given to Germany and Belgium as their
national song selection procedures were already too advanced to change.[31]

In 1999, the rule was changed again to allow freedom of language once
more.[12] This linguistic freedom led to the Belgian entry in 2003, Sanomi,
being sung in an entirely fictional language.[38] In 2006 the Dutch entry,
Amambanda, was sung partly in English and partly in an artificial
language.[39]. In 2008, again a Belgian entry, O Julissi was made in an
imaginary language.[40]

### [edit] Broadcasting

Each participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its
entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the
interval act for advertising breaks if they wish.[20] From 1999 onwards,
broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more
advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the
programme.[36]

#### [edit] Political recognition issues

In 1978, during the performance of the Israeli entry, the Jordanian
broadcaster JRTV suspended the broadcast and showed pictures of flowers. When
it became apparent during the later stages of the voting sequence that Israel
was going to win the Contest, JRTV abruptly ended the transmission.[31]
Afterwards, the Jordanian news media refused to acknowledge the fact that
Israel had won and announced that the winner was Belgium (which had actually
come 2nd).[41] In 2005, Lebanon intended to participate in the Contest.
However, Lebanese law does not allow recognition of Israel, and consequently
Lebanese television did not intend to transmit the Israeli entry. The EBU
informed them that such an act would breach the rules of the Contest, and
Lebanon was subsequently forced to withdraw from the competition. Their late
withdrawal incurred a fine, since they had already confirmed their
participation and the deadline had passed.[42]

### [edit] Other

  * In the first Contest in 1956, there was no time limit on songs. In 1957, a limit of 3Â½ minutes was recommended. In 1962, this was revised to 3 minutes precisely.[12]
  * There is no restriction imposed by the EBU on the nationality of the performers or songwriters. Individual broadcasters are, however, permitted to impose their own restrictions at their discretion.[20]
  * From 1957 to 1970 (in 1956 there was no restriction at all), only soloists and duos were allowed on stage. From 1963, a chorus of up to three people was permitted. Since 1971, a maximum of six performers have been permitted on the stage.[20]
  * The performance and/or lyrics of a song "must not bring the Contest into disrepute".[20]
  * Since 1990, all people on stage must be at least 16 years of age.[20]

last year in which that nation participated under one name.

<IMG>

Regular participants in 1994. The addition of Central and Eastern European
countries, and the separate ex-Yugoslavian states, makes a stark change from
the participation map of 1992.

The number of countries participating each year has steadily grown over the
course of the years, from seven participants in 1956 to over 20 in the late
1980s. In 1993 there were 25 countries participating in the competition,
includingâfor the first time that yearâBosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and
Slovenia, entering independently due to the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.

Due to the fact that the Contest is a live television programme, a reasonable
time limit must be imposed on the duration of the show. In recent years the
nominal limit has been three hours, with the broadcast occasionally
overrunning. In 2005 the programme was a little under 3Â½ hours long.
Following the introduction of the shortened voting announcements in 2006, the
duration of the Contest was three hours and five minutes.

### [edit] Pre-selections and relegation

Since 1993, there have been more countries wishing to enter the Contest than
there is time to reasonably include all their entries in a single TV show.
Several relegation or qualification systems have, therefore, been tried in
order to limit the number of countries participating in the competition in any
given year. The 1993 Contest introduced two new features: firstly, a pre-
selection competition was held in Ljubljana in which seven new countries
fought for three places in the international competition.[31] Bosnia &
Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia took
part in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet; and the three former Yugoslav
republicsâBosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and Sloveniaâqualified for a place
in the international final. Also to be introduced that year was relegation.
The six lowest-placed countries in the 1993 score table were forced to skip
the next year, in order to allow the countries which failed the 1993 pre-
selection into the 1994 Contest.[31] The 1994 Contest included also âfor the
first timeâLithuania, Poland and Russia.

Relegation continued through 1994 and 1995; but in 1996 a different pre-
selection system was used, in which nearly all the countries participated.
Audio tapes of all the songs were sent to juries in each of the countries some
weeks before the television show. These juries selected the songs which would
then proceed to be included in the international broadcast.[43] Norway, as the
host country in 1996 (having won the 1995 Contest), automatically qualified
and was therefore excluded from the necessity of going through the pre-
selection.

One country which failed to qualify in the 1996 pre-selection was Germany. As
one of the largest financial contributors to the EBU, together with having one
of the largest television audiences in Europe, neither they nor the EBU were
happy about their exclusion from the international final.[43]

### [edit] Big Four

From 1998 onwards, four particular countries would always qualify for the
Eurovision final, regardless of their positions on the scoreboard in previous
Contests.[31] They earned this special status by being the four biggest
financial contributors to the EBU (without which the production of the
Eurovision Song Contest would not be possible). These countries are Germany,
France, Spain and the United Kingdom. Due to their untouchable status in the
Contest, these countries became known as the Big Four.

### [edit] Qualification

From 1997 to 2001, countries qualified for each Contest based on the average
of their points totals for their entries over the previous five years.
However, there was much discontent voiced over this system because a country
could be punished by not being allowed to enter merely because of poor
previous results, which did not take into account how good a fresh attempt
might be. This led the EBU to create what was hoped would be a more permanent
solution to the problem, which was to have two shows every year: a
qualification round, and the grand final. In these two shows there would be
enough broadcast time to include all the countries which wished to
participate, every year. The qualification round became known as the
Eurovision Semi-Final.

## [edit] Semi-finals

A qualification round, known as the semi-final, was introduced for the 2004
Contest. This semi-final was held on the Wednesday during Eurovision Week, and
was a programme similar in format to the grand final, whose time slot remained
19:00 UTC on the Saturday. Since then, the semi-final programme has been held
on the Thursday of Eurovision Week.

The semi-final includes those countries whose ranking on the scoreboard the
previous year was not high enough to ensure direct qualification for the
final. Until 2007, it was necessary for a country to attain a place within the
top ten of the final scoreboard to be assured of direct qualification for the
next year's grand final. The Big Four rule remains, so that France, Germany,
Spain and the United Kingdom always automatically bypass the semi-final and
are directly included in the grand final.

Since the introduction of the semi-final, it has been possible for countries
to vote even though they are not participating in the programme: for example
it is possible for one of the Big Four to vote for countries in the semi-final
even though they do not participate in the semi-final themselves; and a
country in the semi-final, which fails to qualify for the final, may still
vote for the other countries in the final on Saturday.

After the votes have been cast in the semi-final, the countries which received
the most votesâand will therefore proceed to the final on Saturdayâare
announced in no particular order. The announcement of the actual number of
points these qualifiers received is withheld by the EBU until after the grand
final, lest the news influence the result on Saturday through tactical voting
or otherwise.

The ten most highly-placed non-Big Four countries in the final were guaranteed
a place in next year's final, without the need to participate in next year's
semi. If, for example, Germany comes in the top ten, the eleventh-placed non-
Big-Four country will automatically qualify for next year's final.[20]

On 28 September 2007, at a meeting of the EBU reference group, it was decided
that from the 2008 Contest onwards there will be held two semi-finals. The
introduction of the second semi final is supposed to prevent block voting
between countries: for example, the UK can not vote for Ireland and Greece can
not vote for Cyprus. Only the host country and the Big Four automatically
qualify for the grand final, and they are joined by ten countries from each
semiâto make a total of 25 entries in the final.[44]

## [edit] Winners

Further information: Eurovision Song Contest winners

Winning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a unique opportunity for the
winning artist(s) to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by
launching or furthering their international career. However, throughout the
history of the Contest relatively few names have gone on to be huge
international stars.

### [edit] Artists

The most notable winning Eurovision artist whose career was directly launched
into the spotlight following their win was ABBA, who won the Contest for
Sweden in 1974 with their song "Waterloo". ABBA went on to be one of the most
successful bands of their time.

Another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame and
success was CÃ©line Dion, who won the Contest for Switzerland in 1988 with the
song "Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi". Dion's success, however, is not as directly
attributed to her winning the Contest, as she achieved international fame some
years later.

Other artists who have achieved varying degrees of success after winning the
Contest include France Gall ("PoupÃ©e de cire, poupÃ©e de son", Luxembourg
1965), Dana ("All Kinds of Everything", Ireland 1970), Vicky Leandros ("AprÃ¨s
toi", Luxembourg 1972), Brotherhood of Man ("Save Your Kisses for Me", United
Kingdom 1976), Marie Myriam ("L'oiseau et l'enfant", France 1977), Johnny
Logan (who won twice for Ireland; with "What's Another Year?" in 1980, and
"Hold Me Now" in 1987), Bucks Fizz ("Making Your Mind Up", United Kingdom
1981), Nicole ("Ein BiÃchen Frieden", Germany 1982) and Herreys ("Diggi-Loo
Diggi-Ley", Sweden 1984). Many other winners include well-known artists who
won the Contest mid-career, after they had already established themselves as
successful.

Some artists, however, have vanished into relative obscurity, making little or
no impact on the international music scene after their win.

### [edit] Countries

Ireland holds the record for the most number of wins, having won the Contest
seven timesâincluding three times in a row in 1992, 1993 and 1994. In second
place with five wins each is the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and France. Spain
was the first country to win in two consecutive occasions (in 1968 and 1969),
followed by Luxembourg (in 1972 and 1973) and Israel (in 1978 and 1979).
Ireland and the United Kingdom both have an average of 72 points per year
which is higher than any other country.

The early years of the Contest saw many wins for "traditional" Eurovision
countries: France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. However, the success of
these countries has declined in recent decades: the Netherlands last won in
1975; France in 1977; and Luxembourg in 1983. The last time Luxembourg entered
the Contest was in 1993.

The first years of the 21st century produced a spate of first-time winners,
from both "new" Eurovision countries, and old-timers who had entered for many
years without a win. Every year from 2001 to 2008 resulted in a country
winning for the first time. The 2006 winner was Finland, which finally won
after having entered the Contest for 45 years. Ukraine on the other hand did
not have to wait so long, winning with their second entry in 2004. Serbia won
the very first year it entered as an independent state, in 2007.

As of 2008, the country which has entered the longest with no wins to their
name is Portugal. They started entering in 1964, and are still awaiting their
first win.

## [edit] Criticisms and controversy

The Contest has been the subject of criticism regarding both its musical
content and the perception that it is more about politics than it is about
music.[45][46]

### [edit] Musical style and presentation

Due to the fact that the songs are playing to such a diverse international
audience with diverse musical tastes, and that countries want to be able to
appeal to as many people as possible to gain votes, the majority of the songs
historically have been middle-of-the-road pop. Deviations from this formula
have rarely achieved success, leading to criticism that the music in the
Contest is old-fashioned, and "bubblegum pop".[47] This well-established
pattern, however, was notably broken in 2006 with Finnish hard rock band
Lordi's landslide victory. As it is a visual show, many performances attempt
to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music,
which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks and what some critics have
called the Eurovision kitsch drive[48].

### [edit] Political and national voting

The Contest has long been perceived as politically influenced, where
judgesâand now televotersâallocate points based on their nation's
relationship to the other countries, rather than on the musical merits of the
songs.[49] According to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain
countries do tend to form "clusters" or "cliques" by frequently voting in the
same way.[50] Defenders of the Contest argue that the reason certain countries
allocate disproportionately high points to others is because the people of
those countries share similar musical tastes and cultures and speak similar
languages,[51] and are therefore more likely to appreciate each other's music:
for example, the explanation for Greece and Cyprus's unfailing exchange of 12
points (every single time since popular voting was introduced in 1998) is
because those countries share the same music industry and language, and
artists who are popular in one country are popular in the other. A common
counterexample to the criticism is the high score that is often exchanged
between Ukraine and Russia, even when they are ruled by political parties that
are hostile to each other.

Following these criticisms, it has been announced that juries are to return to
the Contest in 2009. The two systems will work together, although how this
will be done has not yet been decided,[32] nor has a conclusive solution to
the problem of 'Eastern bloc' voting[52][53][54] been achieved.

## [edit] Spin-offs

A number of spin-offs and imitators of the Eurovision Song Contest have been
produced over the years:

  * Asia-Pacific Song ContestâAsia-Pacific version.
  * Junior Eurovision Song Contestâheld annually since 2003, for artists under the age of 16.
  * Sopot International Song Festivalâheld in Sopot, Poland, annually since 1961.
  * Intervision Song Contestâheld by the Eastern bloc countries between 1977 and 1980.
  * World Oriental Music Festivalâfirst held in Sarajevo in 2005; includes participants from Europe and Asia.
  * Bundesvision Song Contestâheld annually between the 16 states of Germany since 2005.
  * Baltic Song Contestâheld annually in Karlshamn, Sweden.

In Autumn 2005, the EBU organised a special programme to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Contest. The show, entitled Congratulations (after Cliff
Richard's entry for the United Kingdom in 1968) was held in Copenhagen, and
featured many artists from the last 50 years of the Contest. A telephone vote
was held to determine the most popular Eurovision song of all-time, which was
won by ABBA's Waterloo (winner, Sweden 1974).[55]
