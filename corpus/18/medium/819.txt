## [edit] Early life

Pausch was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and grew up in Columbia, Maryland.[3]
After graduating from Oakland Mills High School in Columbia, Pausch received
his bachelor's degree in computer science from Brown University in May 1982
and his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in August
1988.[4] While completing his doctoral studies, Pausch was briefly employed at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Adobe Systems.[5]

## [edit] Computer science career

Pausch was an assistant and associate professor in the Department of Computer
Science at the University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied
Science from 1988 until 1997. While there, he completed sabbaticals at Walt
Disney Imagineering and Electronic Arts (EA). In 1997, Pausch became Associate
Professor of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Design, at
Carnegie Mellon University. He was a co-founder in 1998, along with Don
Marinelli, of CMU's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), and he started the
Building Virtual Worlds[6] course at CMU and taught it for 10 years. He
consulted with Google on user interface design and also consulted with PARC,
Imagineering, and Media Metrix.[5] Pausch is also the founder of the Alice
software project.[7] He was a National Science Foundation Presidential Young
Investigator and a Lilly Foundation Teaching Fellow.[8] Pausch was the author
or co-author of five books and over 70 articles.

Pausch received two awards from ACM in 2007 for his achievements in computing
education: the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award and the ACM
Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education Award for Outstanding
Contributions to Computer Science Education.[9] He was also inducted as a
Fellow of the ACM in 2007.

## [edit] Cancer and death

The poster for Pausch's "The Last Lecture"

Pausch was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer[10][11] and underwent a Whipple
procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) on September 19, 2006 in an unsuccessful
attempt to halt his pancreatic cancer.[12] He was told in August 2007 to
expect a remaining three to six months of good health. He soon moved his
family to Chesapeake, Virginia, a suburb near Norfolk, to be close to his
wife's family. On March 13, 2008, Pausch advocated for greater federal funding
for pancreatic cancer before the United States Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related
Agencies.[13] In the week prior to this, he had been hospitalized in order to
have needle aspiration of pleural effusion in his right lung.[14]

On May 2, 2008, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed that he had
very tiny (5 millimetres (0.20 in) or less) metastases in his lungs and some
lymph nodes in his chest. He also had some metastases in his peritoneal and
retroperitoneal cavities. On June 26, 2008, Pausch indicated that he was
considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse
side effects. He was, however, considering some immuno-therapy-based
approaches.[15] On July 24, on behalf of Pausch, a friend anonymously posted a
message on Pausch's webpage stating that a biopsy had indicated that the
cancer had progressed further than what was expected from recent PET scans and
that Pausch had "taken a step down" and was "much sicker than he had been".
The friend also stated that Pausch had then enrolled in a hospice program
designed to provide palliative care to those at the end of life.[15]

Sister project Wikinews has related news: "Last Lecture" Professor Randy
Pausch dies at age 47  
Pausch died from pancreatic cancer at his family's home in Chesapeake,
Virginia on July 25, 2008, having moved there so that his wife and children
would be near family after his death. He is survived by his wife Jai, and
their three children, Dylan, Logan and Chloe.[16]

## [edit] Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams

Main article: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams

Pausch delivered his "Last Lecture", titled Really Achieving Your Childhood
Dreams, at CMU on September 18, 2007.[17] Randy Pausch gave an abridged
version of his speech on the Oprah show in October 2007.[18][19] The talk was
modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to
think deeply about what matters to them, and then give a hypothetical "final
talk", with a topic such as "what wisdom would you try to impart to the world
if you knew it was your last chance?" Before speaking, Pausch received a long
standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students. When
he motioned them to sit down, saying, "Make me earn it," someone in the
audience shouted back, "You did!"[20][10]

During the lecture, Pausch was upbeat and humorous, alternating between
wisecracks, insights on computer science and engineering education, advice on
building multi-disciplinary collaborations, working in groups and interacting
with other people, offering inspirational life lessons, and performing push-
ups on stage. He also commented on the irony that the "Last Lecture" series
had recently been renamed as "Journeys", saying, "I thought, damn, I finally
nailed the venue and they renamed it."[16] After Pausch finished his lecture,
Steve Seabolt, on behalf of Electronic Artsâwhich is now collaborating with
CMU in the development of Alice 3.0[21]âpledged to honor Pausch by creating
a memorial scholarship for women in computer science, in recognition of
Pausch's support and mentoring of women in CS and engineering.[10]

CMU president Jared Cohon spoke emotionally of Pausch's humanity and called
his contributions to the university and to education "remarkable and
stunning".[22] He then announced that CMU will celebrate Pausch's impact on
the world by building and naming after Pausch a raised pedestrian bridge[23]
to connect CMU's new Computer Science building and the Center for the Arts,
symbolizing the way Pausch linked those two disciplines. Brown University
professor Andries van Dam followed Pausch's last lecture with a tearful and
impassioned speech praising him for his courage and leadership, calling him a
role model.[22][24][25]

### [edit] The Last Lecture

The Disney-owned publisher Hyperion paid $6.7 million for the rights to
publish a book about Pausch called The Last Lecture, co-authored by Pausch and
Wall Street Journal reporter Jeffrey Zaslow.[26] The book became a New York
Times best-seller on June 22, 2008.[27] The Last Lecture expands on Pausch's
speech. The book's first printing had 400,000 copies, and it has been
translated into 17 languages. Despite speculation that the book would be made
into a movie, Pausch had denied these rumors, stating that "there's a reason
to do the book, but if it's telling the story of the lecture in the medium of
film, we already have that."[28]

### [edit] Media coverage

Pausch was named "Person of the Week" on ABC's World News with Charles Gibson
on September 21, 2007.[29] His "Last Lecture" attracted wide attention from
the international media,[30] became an Internet hit, and was viewed over a
million times in the first month after its delivery.[31] On October 22, 2007,
Pausch appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where he discussed his situation and
summarized his "Last Lecture".[19] On October 6, 2007, Pausch joined the
Pittsburgh Steelers for the day during their regular practice, after the
organization learned that one of his childhood dreams mentioned in his "Last
Lecture" was to play in the NFL.[32]

A devoted Star Trek fan, Pausch was invited by film director J. J. Abrams to
film a role in the latest Star Trek movie. Abrams heard of Pausch's condition
and sent a personal e-mail inviting Pausch to the set. Pausch accepted and
traveled to Los Angeles, California to shoot his scene. In addition to
appearing in the film, he also has a line of dialogue and donated the $217.06
paycheck to charity.[33][34] On April 9, 2008, the ABC network aired an hour
long Diane Sawyer feature on Pausch titled "The Last Lecture: A Love Story For
Your Life".[35][36] On July 29, 2008, ABC aired a follow up to the Last
Lecture special, remembering Pausch and his famous lecture.[37]

### [edit] Other lectures and appearances

Pausch gave a lecture about time management[38] on November 27, 2007 at the
University of Virginia, to an audience of over 850 people.[39] In March 2008,
Pausch appeared in a public service announcement video[40] and testified
before Congress in support of cancer research.[41] On May 18, 2008, Pausch
made a surprise return appearance at Carnegie Mellon, giving a speech at the
commencement ceremony,[42] as well as attending the School of Computer
Science's diploma ceremony,[43] and on May 19 Pausch appeared on the Good
Morning America show.[44] His lecture, "Really Achieving Your Childhood
Dreams", was nominated at the 2007 YouTube Video Awards.[45][46]
