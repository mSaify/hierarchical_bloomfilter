The Toyota Prius (pronounced /ËpÉ¹iËÉs/) is a hybrid electric mid-size car
developed and manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation. It first went on
sale in Japan in 1997, making it the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle. It
was subsequently introduced worldwide in 2001. The Prius is sold in more than
40 countries and regions, with its largest markets being those of Japan and
North America.[1] As a top seller in the US market, the U.S. Toyota Prius made
up more than half of the 1.2 million Prius sold worldwide by early 2009.[2][3]

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, in 2007, the
2008 Prius is the most fuel efficient car sold in the U.S.[4] The EPA and
California Air Resources Board also rate the Prius as among the cleanest
vehicles sold in the United States based on non-CO2 emissions.[5] The UK
Department for Transport also reported the Prius is tied as the sixth least
CO2-emitting vehicle on sale in the UK.[6]

Toyota Prius Kyoto Palace patrol car

The 2001â2003 Prius for the United States market was powered by a 1.5-liter
4 cylinder[11] gasoline engine, a permanent magnet AC electric motor, and a
274-volt nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery pack. The gasoline engine
developed 70 hp (52 kW) and 82 ftÂ·lbf (111 NÂ·m) of torque. The electric
motor generated a maximum of 44 hp (33 kW) and 258 ftÂ·lbf (350 NÂ·m) of
torque. Japanese versions were less powerful.[12]

The engine and motor power were increased over the previous model. Air
conditioning and a continuously variable transmission were standard
equipment.[13]

In the United States, the NHW11 was the first Prius to be sold. The Prius was
marketed between the smaller Echo and the larger Corolla. The published retail
price of the car was US$19,995.[14] The California Air Resources Board (CARB)
classified the car as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV).[15]

European sales began in September 2000.[16]

The official launch of the Prius in Australia occurred in 2001 after the
Sydney Motor Show[17], although sales were extremely poor until the NHW20
model arrived.

The Prius was completely redesigned into a mid-size liftback which is between
the Corolla and the Camry in size, with redistributed mechanical and interior
space that significantly increased the rear-seat legroom to exceed that of
many larger automobiles. The new model is 6 inches (150 mm) longer than the
previous version.[18] Its more aerodynamic body resulted in a drag coefficient
of 0.26 Cd.[19]

The new Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) uses an all-electric compressor for
cooling. Combined with a smaller and lighter NiMH battery, the NHW20 is more
powerful and more efficient than the NHW11.[20] Air conditioning is now
operated independently of the gasoline engine, an industry first.[21] In the
U.S., the battery pack of the 2004 Prius is warranted for 100,000 miles
(160,000 km) or 8 years.[22]. The warranty in California is 150,000 miles
(240,000 km) or 10 years for the Prius and in the seven Northeastern states
that have adopted the stricter California emission control standards

It is classified as a SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle) and is
certified by California Air Resources Board as an "Advanced Technology Partial
Zero Emission Vehicle" (AT-PZEV).[23]

2006 Prius cut-away in Toyota showroom in Paris

Among the Prius's options are Toyota's implementation of a Smart Key System
(the feature can be user-deactivated), DVD navigation on the MFD, Vehicle
Stability Control and Bluetooth for hands-free calling. A new Intelligent
Parking Assist system was available in Japan and Europe since its launch.[24]

Production of the Prius for the Chinese market began in December 2005 by
Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor, a joint venture with First Automobile Works.

#### [edit] Model year changes

The 2006 model introduced some minor cosmetic changes, such as a higher-
resolution liquid crystal display, as well as new optional features such as a
rear-view camera, advanced airbags and an upgraded audio system with an
auxiliary input. The 2007 Prius adds advanced and side-curtain airbags
standard on all models. A Touring Edition was introduced that includes an
elongated larger rear spoiler as well as larger, sharper-pointed 7-spoke 16"
alloy wheels with plastic hub cap cover to protect it from scratches when
parking against the curb. The Touring Edition also comes with a firmer
European-style tuned suspension, standard high-intensity-discharge (HID)
headlights and integrated (non-HID) fog lights.

#### [edit] Crash testing

NHTSA (United States) crash testing of the 2004 Prius yielded a five star
driver and four star passenger rating in the frontal collision test (out of
five stars). Side crash results were four out of five stars for both front and
rear seats. The car scored four out of five stars in rollover testing.[25]

IIHS crash tests score the Prius Good overall in frontal collisions and Good
overall in side impact collisions in models equipped with side airbags.[26] A
Poor score is given to models without side airbags.[27] Side airbags became
standard on 2007 American models.

In 2004, EuroNCAP tested the Prius. It earned the following ratings: Adult
Occupant: 5/5 stars<IMG><IMG><IMG><IMG> Child Occupant: 4/5

Toyota debuted the 2010 Prius at the 2009 North American International Auto
Show,[29] with sales to begin in May 2009.[30] Its new body design is more
aerodynamic, with a coefficient of drag reduced to 0.25 Cd, and its EPA
estimated combined fuel economy cycle is 50 miles per US gallon (4.7 L/100 km;
60 mpg-imp), a 4 miles per US gallon increase (0.59 L per 100 km decrease)
over the previous generation.[31]

The 1.8-liter gasoline engine (previously 1.5-liters) generates 98 hp and with
the added power of the electric motor total horsepower is 134 hp (previously
110). The larger engine's displacement allows for increased torque reducing
engine speeds (RPM) which helps improve fuel economy at highway speeds. With
an electric water pump, the 1.8 liter Prius engine is the first Toyota engine
that requires no belts which further improves fuel economy.[32] Also, the
battery pack is smaller and more efficient, as are the electric motors and
other parts of the car.[30]

The Prius will offer three optional packages:

  * A Navigation Package which includes a voice-activated touch-screen DVD-based navigation system and a 8-speaker JBL audio system with XM satellite radio, MP3/WMA playback capability, Bluetooth and backup camera.
  * A Solar Roof Package includes the Navigation Package and adds a power tilt/slide moonroof along with a solar powered ventilation system which uses an electric fan to help keep the vehicle cooler when parked under the sun. The solar roof was originally intended to assist in charging the vehicle's battery, but the system was configured to only power ventilation due to electromagnetic interference.[33]
  * An Advanced Technology Package includes the Navigation Package while adding a Pre-Collision System, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist (LKA) and Intelligent Parking Assist.

Other options include LED headlamps and Safety Connect.[34]

Toyota filed over one thousand patents during the development of the new
Prius. Toyota's global goal is to sell about 400,000 units annually by
2010.[35]

#### [edit] Plug-in

On January 10, 2009, Toyota Vice President of Environmental and External
Affairs Irv Miller announced that Prius PHVs (plug-in hybrid vehicles) powered
by lithium-ion batteries will be available for fleet buyers beginning late
2009.[36]

## [edit] Background

### [edit] History

In 1994, Toyota executive Takeshi Uchiyamada was given the task of creating a
new car which would be both fuel efficient and environmentally friendly.[37]
After reviewing over 100 hybrid designs, the engineering team settled on a
hybrid engine design based on a 1974 TRW patent, but many technical and
engineering problems had to be solved within the three years that the team was
given to bring the car to the Japanese market, a goal they barely achieved as
the first Prius went on sale in December 1997. A main problem was the
longevity of the battery, which needed to last between 7 and 10 years. The
solution the engineers came up with was to keep the battery pack between 60%
and 40% charged, proving to be the "sweet spot" for extending the battery life
to roughly that of the other car components.[38]

The car was a modest success in Japan and after gathering several years of
test data from the Japanese early adopters, the company felt it was safe to
put it on sale in the U.S. and European markets in 2001. Sales were limited
and customer waiting lists of up to 6 months were common during the first few
years. In 2004, a complete redesign, increased production, and soaring fuel
prices led to significant increases in sales.[citation needed]

### [edit] Name

The word prius is a Latin word meaning to precede."[39] A Toyota spokesperson
stated that "Toyota chose this name because the Prius vehicle is the
predecessor of cars to come."[40]

Prius is not a verb but a Latin comparative adjective or adverb, the neuter
nominative singular form of the adjective whose corresponding masculine and
feminine nominative singular forms are prior[41] (see also Latin declension -
Irregular adverbs and their comparative and superlative forms) with meanings
"ahead, in front, leading; previous, earlier, preceding, prior; former;
basic".[42]

Some enthusiasts enjoy using Prii as the plural, which would be correct if
prius were a regular second declension Latin noun. The actual Latin plural of
the adjective is priora (Reference [40] is slightly in error here). All of
these forms are nominative case and there are several other forms for the
other cases. As for the plural of Prius in English, Toyota has said that it is
simply Prius and also that owners are welcome to use whatever they like.[43]

Toyota announced on June 7, 2007 that it had sold 1 million hybrid vehicles
globally, and that of those 757,600 were Prius.[44] Nearly 345,000 of the
first 1 million hybrid cars made by Toyota were sold in Japan.[45] In May
2008, Toyota announced that its worldwide cumulative sales of the Prius had
passed the 1 million mark. The Prius, which is sold in more than 40 countries
and regions, has its largest markets in Japan and North America. Nearly 60% of
all Prius sales have been in North America, where 183,800 vehicles were sold
in 2007.[1] That sales pace has accelerated in early 2008, with 66,100
vehicles sold in North America in the first four months, a rate that would
result in nearly 200,000 sales if continued through the entire year. In fact,
Toyota sold 21,757 Prius hybrids in the United States in April, setting a
record for April sales and making the Prius the third most popular vehicle in
the Toyota line, trailing the Corolla and the Camry.[46]

U.S. sales of the Prius began in August 2000. By 2001 sales there totaled
15,556, and by 2002 had reached 20,119.[47] In 2004 sales there were 53,991,
and doubled in 2005 to 107,897, about 60% of the world total of 180,000.[48]
By June 7, 2007, 266,212 Prius had been sold in the U.S., and accounted for
40% of the hybrid market there in 2006.[49] As of November 2007 Toyota has
sold 510,325 Prius in the US since its initial launch in 2000. Prius gas-
electric hybrid mid-size sedan reported sales of 14,212 units for a best-ever
December and best-ever year-end sales of 181,221 units, up 68.9 percent over
2006.[50] By February 2009 the Prius sales in the US made up more than half of
the 1.2 million Prius sold worldwide.[2][3]

Toyota Prius used by NYPD Traffic Enforcement

The Prius is a power-split or series-parallel hybrid, a vehicle that can be
propelled by gasoline (petrol) and/or electric power. Components of the system
include:

  1. Regenerative braking, using motor-generators, which converts kinetic energy of motion into electrical energy that is stored in the traction battery and reduces wear on the brake pads;
  2. A 1NZ-FXE internal combustion engine (ICE) using Atkinson cycle which is 12-14%[52] more efficient than the more powerful Otto cycle. The gasoline engine normally shuts off during traffic stops and the accessories (including the air conditioning) are powered by the battery pack. The engine is used both to propel the vehicle and to recharge the batteries. Because of the availability of extra power from the electric motors for rapid acceleration the engine is sized smaller than usual for increased fuel efficiency and lowered emissions with acceptable acceleration; The penalty of the Atkinson cycle is low specific power, so the battery and generator is needed to give extra power when accelerating, whilst allowing the vehicle to cruise on the low powered engine, [53]
  3. Two electric motor/generators: MG1 and MG2. MG1, reversible and up to 10,000 rpm, starts the engine and provides counter torque for the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). MG2 provides 50 kW (67 hp) between 1,200 to 1,540 rpm and 400 NÂ·m (295 lbÂ·ft) torque between 0 to 1,200 rpm, contributing to performance and economy. These motor-generators are used as generators when used for regenerative braking, and as motors are capable of starting the vehicle (and gas engine if needed) and low speed (<~30 mph (48 km/h), 41 mph (66 km/h) in NHW20) travel;
  4. A Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) unit that combines a planetary gearset that behaves like a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) called the Power Split Device[54] to increase efficiency. The computer controlled HSD transaxle adjusts and blends the amount of power from the gasoline engine and electric motor-generator(s) as needed by the front drive wheels and rechargeable batteries;
  5. A sealed 38-module nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack providing 273.6 volts, 6.5 AÂ·h capacity and weighing 53.3 kg (118 lb)[55] is supplied by Japan's Panasonic. They are normally charged to 40â60% of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as provide a reserve for regenerative braking;
  6. Wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.26 (0.29 for 2000 model) with a Kammback design to reduce air resistance. Lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction;
  7. A vacuum flask for storing hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time (US market);
  8. An EV mode (or stealth mode) that allows drivers to operate on electric power only under low-power conditions for a limited duration of time (Europe and Asian markets, aftermarket in the US). Advocates for the blind warn that the Prius is silent, and that it could be hazardous to blind pedestrians and others accustomed to engine noise to warn of a nearby vehicle;
  9. Vehicle weight is reduced by the use of a flexible resin gasoline tank and by the use of aluminum instead of steel for the engine bay hood and hatchback.
  10. Starting with the 2010 model year (3rd generation), the gasoline engine uses an electric water pump, permitting an engine design with no serpentine belts, improving efficiency.[56]

The computer program used in the Prius shuts off the engine when the car is
stopped, is reversing, or is descending hills, thereby dramatically decreasing
fuel consumption in city driving . The HSD's on-board computer program
determines when and how to use the engine, motor, or both to power the car and
recharge the battery so as to maximize efficiency. Typically, a gasoline
engine runs inefficiently at half-throttle, creating a choking condition
called pumping loss, a major reason for the inefficiency of gasoline engines
compared to diesels. The Prius minimizes pumping loss by using a high torque
range as much as possible with the throttle fully open. Drive-by-wire throttle
control technology and Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive (a torque combiner,
electric drive, and computer control) are essential to this engine control. In
addition to the immediate benefit of reducing fuel consumption and emissions,
stopping the gasoline engine also improves the performance of the catalytic
converter, as the exhaust gases from an idling engine tend to cool the
catalyst below its optimal temperature.

Hybrid Synergy Drive

Typical gasoline- or diesel-engined vehicles consume fuel when the vehicle is
stopped, as is common in city driving. The Prius typically shuts down the
gasoline engine and runs solely off the battery pack at low speeds and when
stopped. A non-hybrid car also gets worse fuel consumption in city driving
because its engine is continually used to accelerate the car to driving speed
and then this energy is lost to friction brakes during stop-and-go driving.
The Prius recaptures some of this energy by using regenerative braking to
charge its battery pack while slowing down with its motor-generators in
generator mode. For acceptable acceleration the IC engine on a "standard" car
typically is much larger than needed for constant-speed travel, and is a
relatively high power to rate weight ratio Otto cycle engine. By using both an
Atkinson cycle gasoline engine, which whilst more efficient, has a much poorer
power to weight ratio and an electric motors for acceleration the Prius engine
can nevertheless be a smaller size and still provide acceptable acceleration
[57]. This means such a hybrid are can have high fuel efficiency when cruising
on the Atkinson cycle engine, and in city driving, though factors including
driving style, air conditioning use, and short trips may offset some of this
advantage. The frequent starting and stopping of the Prius engine does not
cause noticeable additional wear and tear or emission problems because the
electric drive motors have enough power to quickly spin the engine to optimal
speed (around 1,000 rpm) before fuel is admitted.

Energy screen on the 2003 Prius

For any car, aerodynamic losses, which vary roughly as the velocity squared
due to air drag are much greater on the highway than in low speed city
driving. The Prius hybrid has less of an advantage in higher speed open road
driving, typical of intercity driving. Nevertheless, the Prius still obtains
improved fuel consumption under these circumstances since it can use a smaller
and more efficient engine than would otherwise be required. The electric
motor(s), powered by the battery pack, can provide the extra peak power needed
for acceleration, passing and limited hill climbing. The lower weight, cross
sectional area and lowest drag coefficient of a production car in the U.S.
market make the Prius a very efficient[58][4] highway traveler, getting 45
miles per US gallon (5.2 L/100 km; 54 mpg-imp) on the highway according to the
U.S. EPA.

The environmental impact of the car's batteries has been questioned.[59] To
encourage battery recycling, dealers are paid a $200 fee for return of the
car's batteries.[60] Toyota has laboratory reports that some Prius battery
packs have lasted the equivalent of 180,000 miles (290,000 km).[55] As the
cars start to age, early reports have shown that in at least some cases the
batteries can last in excess of 250,000 miles (400,000 km).[61] Individual
battery longevity will vary depending upon the treatment and use history of
the battery pack. A degraded battery pack will reduce performance and fuel
economy, but not leave the car inoperable.

Fuel consumption, or fuel-efficiency in cars is generally measured as distance
travelled per unit volume of fuel, as in miles per gallon (mpg), or as the
volume of fuel required to cover a given distance, as in litres per 100
kilometres (L/100 km). Diesel fuel does have about an 11% higher energy
density than gasoline (petrol), so that needs to be taken into account in pure
energy-efficiency calculations and comparisons. Fuel-price-efficiency
calculations will vary between various parts of the world, with diesel fuel
pump prices being higher than gasoline prices in some countries, whilst in
others it is less expensive than gasoline.[62]

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) test results
must be posted on new vehicle windows, and are the only fuel consumption
figures that can be advertised. EPA testing procedures for all vehicles were
revised in 2007 in an attempt to better match what the average driver would
achieve.[63] The following data is taken from these figures:[64]

2008 Prius:

  * 48 miles per US gallon (4.9 L/100 km; 58 mpg-imp) for city driving
  * 45 miles per US gallon (5.2 L/100 km; 54 mpg-imp) for highway driving
  * 46 miles per US gallon (5.1 L/100 km; 55 mpg-imp) combined

2001 Prius:

  * 42 miles per US gallon (5.6 L/100 km; 50 mpg-imp) city driving
  * 41 miles per US gallon (5.7 L/100 km; 49 mpg-imp) highway driving

The Prius is the most efficient car available in the U.S. in 2008, based on
the official rating.[4]

#### [edit] United Kingdom

The official fuel consumption data, provided by the Department for Transport,
rates the Prius as: 56.5 miles per imperial gallon (5.00 L/100 km; 47.0 mpg-
US) urban, 67.3 miles per imperial gallon (4.20 L/100 km; 56.0 mpg-US) extra
urban and 65.7 miles per imperial gallon (4.30 L/100 km; 54.7 mpg-US)
combined.[65] Eleven diesel-powered cars, some of them smaller, have a better
fuel-efficiency (by fuel volume) than the Prius for combined use.[66][67]

According to the Department for Transport, the Prius is tied with the MINI
Cooper D as the third least CO2-emitting vehicles at 104 g/km, behind the tied
Volkswagen Polo 1.4 TDI and SEAT Ibiza 1.4 TDI at 99 g/km - it is the least
CO2-emitting petrol-powered car, the Polo and the Ibiza being diesel (being
these city cars).[6]

### [edit] Independent test data and comparisons with other vehicles

Several organizations have tested the fuel economy of the Prius and compared
it directly with other cars.

Consumer tests have shown that petrol-electric hybrid cars in general are a
little more fuel-efficient (by fuel volume) than top of the range manual
transmission diesels.[68] However, diesel fuel has a significantly higher
energy density than the gasoline used by the Prius, and in some countries
diesel is less expensive than gasoline, so overall diesel with manual
transmission may be competitive with hybrid technology in some cases.[62]

  * January 2009: Edmunds.com compared the 2009 Prius to the all new 2010 Honda Insight. The Prius returned 54.4 MPG compared to the Insight's 51.5 MPG.[69]

  * September 2008: A Popular Mechanics comparison shows that the 2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDI diesel has slightly better highway fuel economy than the 2008 Prius with 45.4 MPG compared to 44.8 MPG. The Prius beats the Jetta in city fuel economy, however: 44.7 MPG compared to 32 MPG.[70]

  * August 2008: Edmunds.com test of Prius and Honda Fit, resulted in the Prius averaging 42 miles per US gallon (5.6 L/100 km; 50 mpg-imp). While the non-hybrid Fit averaged 28 miles per US gallon (8.4 L/100 km; 34 mpg-imp). The Honda Fit was priced $8,425 less in this test. Considering all vehicle factors, Edmunds.com awarded the overall win in this comparison by a narrow margin to the Honda Fit.[71]

  * 22 June 2008 BBC Top Gear tested the Prius against a BMW M3 around their track for ten laps at maximum speed, the Toyota Prius manage a fuel consumption of 17.2 miles per imperial gallon (16.4 L/100 km). the BMW achieve 19.4 miles per imperial gallon (14.6 L/100 km) with its 4.0 L V8 engine

  * June 2008: The Prius is the most fuel efficient car that Consumer Reports has tested[72] since the discontinuation of the 3-door Honda Insight. Consumer Reports gave a real-world fuel consumption rating of 44 miles per US gallon (5.3 L/100 km; 53 mpg-imp) for the Prius.[73]

  * May 2008: The Prius was the overall winner of the Edmunds.com "Gas-Sipper Smackdown" fuel economy test, winning three of the five tests. The 2005 Jetta TDI won the remaining two tests, but factoring in the higher cost of diesel the Jetta ranked third in fuel costs behind both the Prius and Smart Fortwo. The other car tested was the North American Ford Focus.[74]

  * March 2008: The UK's Sunday Times did a comparison of the Prius with another car in long distance town and country driving.[75] The results showed that the other car, a BMW 520d SE with a 177 bhp (132 kW) diesel engine and regenerative braking, averaged 50.3 miles per imperial gallon (5.62 L/100 km; 41.9 mpg-US) whilst the Prius averaged 48.1 miles per imperial gallon (5.87 L/100 km; 40.1 mpg-US) over exactly the same route. The comparison was performed on a journey of 545 miles (877 km) from London to Geneva, including 100 miles (160 km) of urban driving, about 200 miles (320 km) of driving on rural roads, and about 200 miles (320 km) of motorway driving at speeds of up to 78 miles per hour (126 km/h) on one French autoroute.

  * August 2007: UK's Auto Express magazine performed independent fuel efficiency tests, on public roads, on a number of hatchbacks, and in August 2007 published their list of the ten most efficient. The Prius achieved 10th place in the list, returning 41.5 miles per imperial gallon (6.81 L/100 km; 34.6 mpg-US). A CitroÃ«n C4 CoupÃ© 1.6 HDi got 1st place with 49.6 miles per imperial gallon (5.70 L/100 km; 41.3 mpg-US).[76]

  * December 2005: Edmunds.com test of the Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid resulted in the Prius outperforming its competitor by an additional 4.5 mpgâU.S. (0.50 L/100 km / 5.4 mpgâimp) at 48.3 miles per US gallon (4.87 L/100 km; 58.0 mpg-imp).[77]

  * February 2005: In a Popular Mechanics magazine diesel versus hybrid comparison, the Prius outperformed the Volkswagen Jetta GL TDI diesel in both city and highway fuel economy.[78][79]

  * September 2004: Car and Driver tested the Prius along with the Civic Hybrid, Toyota Echo, and Jetta TDI over three separate routes. The Prius yielded the best mileage on the highway and town routes, while tying the Echo for top spot on the suburban route.[80]

  * Motor Trend conducted a test comparing the Prius with a Civic Hybrid. The Prius had the better fuel economy with 43.8 miles per US gallon (5.37 L/100 km; 52.6 mpg-imp) compared to 39.9 miles per US gallon (5.90 L/100 km; 47.9 mpg-imp) for the Civic.[81]

### [edit] Air Pollution

In the United States the EPA measures a vehicle's air-borne pollution based on
hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and
formaldehyde before assigning them a score.[82] In most states the NHW20 Prius
is rated Tier II Bin 3.[83] CARB also does its own emission scoring, the NHW20
Prius meets AT-PZEV certification in California and states that adopted CARB
emission rules.[84]

## [edit] Controversies

### [edit] CO2 advertising claims

In the UK, the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body charged
with policing the rules of the advertising industry, ruled that a television
advert for the Toyota Prius should not be broadcast again in the same form,
having breached rules concerning misleading advertising. The advert claimed
the Prius "emits up to one tonne less CO2 per year," while on-screen text
included: "1 tonne of CO2 less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel
engine. Average calculated on 20,000 km a year." Points of contention were the
vehicles chosen for comparison, whether "up to one tonne less" adequately
communicated that reductions could be lower, and whether the distance used was
appropriate: 20,000 km per year is around a U.S. car's average annual driving
distance, while a UK car's is 13,440 km.[85]

An earlier complaint to the New Zealand Advertising Standards Authority,
decision 03/360 2003 was also upheld. It was ruled that Toyota was in breach
of the New Zealand advertising standards code of ethics, by claiming "up to
89% fewer smog forming emissionsâ. The figure was based on comparison with
Euro 3 standards, which most new cars also met comfortably at the
time.[citation needed]

### [edit] Lifetime energy usage

The British Government and British media have requested Toyota release
detailed figures for the energy use and CO2 emissions resulting from the
building and disposal of the Prius. The UK Government Car Service runs 130
Priuses. Toyota has not supplied the detailed data they requested to support
claims that the lifetime energy usage of the Prius (including the increased
environmental cost of manufacture and disposal of the nickel-metal hydride
battery) are outweighed by lower lifetime fuel consumption.[86] Toyota states
that lifetime CO2 saving is 43 percent.

### [edit] Repair costs

According to a study by Audatex, Prius repairs are slightly more expensive
than those for comparable non-hybrid cars, with a greater cost difference in
the past due to the lack of availability of recycled parts.[87]

### [edit] Political symbolism

The large number of Prius-owning progressive celebrities in 2002 prompted the
Washington Post to dub hybrids "Hollywood's latest politically correct status
symbol."[88] While conservative "Prius Patriots" were also cited in 2005,[89]
the vehicle carries an image as being a car for politically liberal
environmentalists. A 2007 San Francisco Chronicle article said "Prius
Progressives" were becoming an archetype, quoting conservative U.S. pundit
Rush Limbaugh opining that "these liberals think they're ahead of the game on
these things, and they're just suckers."[90]

Some conservatives promote use of the Toyota Prius. For example, Jim Road from
What Would Jesus Drive? encouraged people to drive hybrid cars because of the
damage that large SUVs can do to others.

Former CIA chief R. James Woolsey, Jr. drives a Prius because of its low fuel
consumption. Woolsey noted the volatility of the Middle East, coupled with
anti-US sentiment in much of the region. Noting that the high percentage of
oil drilled in the Middle East gives vast profits to Middle Eastern regimes,
Woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient
vehicles. In a Motor Trend magazine article, Woolsey claimed that those oil
profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, meaning that
Americans who buy inefficient vehicles would, in effect, be indirectly funding
terrorism. "We're paying for both sides in this war, and that's not a good
long-term strategy," said Woolsey. "I have a bumper sticker on the back of my
Prius that reads, 'Bin Laden hates this car.'"[91]

#### [edit] Fashion over function

The Prius's shape gives it a low 0.26 coefficient of drag.[92]

In spite of the efficiency of the Prius's shape, in 2004, industry analyst Art
Spinella of CNW Marketing Research (CNWMR), whose skepticism towards hybrids
is well known (see Lifetime energy cost), said "the Prius was a fashion
statement", attributing its success over the Honda Civic Hybrid, which has a
nearly identical appearance to its non-hybrid versions, to its distinctive
styling, which lets "other people know the driver is driving a hybrid
vehicle". However, this does not explain the lack of success for the even more
distinctive first generation Honda Insight or the brisk sales of the first
generation Prius, which looked almost identical to the non-hybrid Echo.[93].
(Excluding the fact that demand for two-seaters is far less than that for
four-seaters.)

In July 2007 the The New York Times[94] published an article using data from
CNW Marketing Research finding that 57% of Prius buyers said their main reason
for buying was that "it makes a statement about me.", while just 36% cited
fuel economy as a prime motivator. Shortly afterwards Washington Post
columnist Robert Samuelson coined the term "Prius politics" to describe a
situation where the driver's desire to "show off" is a stronger motivator than
the desire to curb greenhouse gas emissions.[95]

### [edit] Quietness

The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2007 on concerns that quiet cars
like the Prius may pose a safety risk to those who rely on engine noise to
sense the presence or location of moving vehicles.[96] Blind pedestrians are a
primary concern, and the National Federation of the Blind advocates audio
emitters on hybrid vehicles,[97] but increased risks may also affect sighted
pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles. In
July 2007, a spokesperson for Toyota said the company is aware of the issue
and is studying options.[98] Both State[99] and Federal legislation[100] have
been proposed and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration held a
public hearing.[101] Different groups and companies are looking at
solutions.[102][103]

## [edit] Government and corporate incentives

### [edit] Government incentives

A number of governments have incentives that are intended to encourage hybrid
car sales. In Belgium, the national government offers reductions in the
purchase price of up to 15% for buying cars that have lower CO2 exhaust.[104]

The federal government in Canada offers to those who buy or lease hybrid cars
a rebate, however the rebate program expired on December 31, 2008.[105] Some
provincial governments also offer incentives such as in British Columbia,[106]
Manitoba,[107] Quebec,[108] Ontario,[109] and Prince Edward Island.[110]

In the United Kingdom, there are both fiscal and parking-related incentives.
The fiscal incentives are general; road tax is just Â£15 a year. Businesses
can now (from 1 April 2008) claim a 100% first year tax write-off for the
Prius because the car has CO2 emissions of less than 110 grams per kilometre.
The tax charge for a Prius that is provided as a company car is just 10% of
its list price, rather than the heftier rates that can be up to 35% of a car's
list price. Parking incentives exist in Richmond upon Thames (south west
London)[111], Westminster (Central London) for resident parking permits[112],
Winchester (now discontinued)[113][114][115], Manchester, and Brighton has
similar plans.[116] Drivers can pay Â£10 to register for an annual exemption
from the Â£8 daily London congestion charge[117][116][118] Some of the
incentives in the United Kingdom have been criticized in the press given that
non-hybrid cars, some of which may have better fuel economy in some
circumstances, are not afforded the same incentives.[119][120]

In the United States, the federal government offers a tax credit to purchasers
until a certain number of cars has been sold by a manufacturer. This has
ranged from US$787 to $3,150, which expired in 2007 for hybrids sold by
Toyota.[121] Some state governments, including Colorado[122],
Connecticut[123], Illinois[124] offer tax incentives. Hybrid engine
automobiles are exempt from high-occupancy vehicle lane restrictions in some
U.S. states.[125]) California (currently until January 1, 2011.[126][127] Los
Angeles and San Jose, California had exempted hybrid cars from paying for
street parking.[128][129] New York State offers a special "green" version of
their E-Z-Pass toll payment tag for hybrid owners who use the NYS Thruway
system, which gives the owners a 10% discount on tolls.[130] Also, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey offers their "green E-Z-Pass" to hybrid
owners, who pay $4 instead of $8 to use all the bridges and tunnels between
New York and New Jersey, except in rush hours.[131] But it is better to get
the NYS Thruway green pass, since the NYS Thruway green pass allows the user
to get the Port Authority Bridges and Tunnels discount, while the Port
Authority Green Pass does not allow the user to get the NYS Thruway discount.
(Both the Port Authority and NYS Thruway green E-Z-Passes are issued by New
York State E-Z-Pass Service Centers, but users need to make sure they are
issued a NYS Thruway green E-Z-Pass if they want to use both discounts.)

In the Netherlands, the government has lowered the tax for company-cars with
CO2 emissions below a certain level (such as the Prius) to 14%. The tax on all
other class company-cars has been raised from 22 to 25%. As a result, in the
month January alone, more than 1800 cars have been sold. The importer has
already indicated that he can no longer meet the demand for the year 2008.
Privately owned cars with low CO2 emissions benefit from lower road taxes.

In Sweden, private purchasers of the Prius (or any other vehicle in the
environmentally less destructive class) are awarded SEK 10,000 (roughly USD
1700, â¬1100) after six months of ownership, in order to stimulate sales and
use of such vehicles. The subsidy program has been very successful.

### [edit] Corporate incentives

Several U.S. companies offer employees incentives. Bank of America will
reimburse $3000 on the purchase of new hybrid vehicles to full- and part-time
associates working more than 20 hours per week.[132] Google,[133] software
company Hyperion Solutions,[134] and organic food and drink producer Clif Bar
& Co[132][broken footnote] offer employees a $5000 credit toward their
purchase of certain hybrid vehicles including the Prius. Integrated Archive
Systems, a Palo Alto IT company, offers a $10,000 subsidy toward the purchase
of hybrid vehicles to full-time employees employed more than one
year.[132][broken footnote] Clothing companies Timberland and Patagonia, law
firm DLA Piper, non-profit American Jewish Committee, software publisher
Topics Entertainment, Logistics Giant Exel Contract Logistics, and research
firm ABR, Inc. are among companies offering eligible employees significant
discounts on certain hybrid vehicles including the Prius.[132][broken
footnote]

Travelers Companies, a large insurance company, offers hybrid owners a 10%
discount on auto insurance in most states.[135] The Farmers Insurance Group
offers a similar discount of up to 10% in most states.[132][broken footnote]

### [edit] EV mode

When the vehicle is turned-on with the "start" button, it is ready to drive
immediately with the electric motor, while electric pumps warm the engine with
previously saved hot engine coolant, before the internal combustion engine is
started. The delay between starting the car and starting the internal
combustion engine is approximately seven seconds. The Asian and European
versions of this vehicle provide a button labeled "EV" that maintains Electric
Vehicle mode after start up, under most low-load driving conditions. This
permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption, and is advertised as a
"quiet" option for short journeys, for example in residential areas at night,
in the Asia manual. The car automatically reverts to normal mode if the
battery becomes exhausted. Prior to the 2010 model, the North American model
did not have the "EV" button, although the "EV" mode is still supported
internally by the Prius Hybrid Vehicle management computer.

### [edit] Plug-in

Main article: Plug-in hybrid

2008, San Mateo, California.

Plug-in hybrids use a larger electric vehicle battery pack that is recharged
from external sources in order to further reduce fuel consumption. The NiMH
batteries[136] in a production PHEV will be built to handle deeper discharge
cycles without loss of lifespan such as the NiMH battery pack in the Toyota
RAV4 EV. Operation of the vehicle will be very similar to a normal hybrid,
except that the electric operation will be more prevalent. In the case of a
Prius PHEV, on the highway, the gasoline engine will operate as before,
leaving the car with the same ability to accelerate and use freeways. Current
converted Prius also operate in a high speed blended mode which can reduce but
not eliminate fuel consumption on the freeway. When driving in slower
conditions or with light loads, the batteries will be used first in a charge-
depleting mode, allowing moderate commutes at low speeds (particularly under
41 mph/65 km/h) to be driven entirely on electricity. Once the batteries have
been sufficiently discharged the car will automatically revert back to the
charge-sustaining mode of the current stock Prius.

A Raleigh, North Carolina firm, Advanced Vehicle Research Center, converts the
Prius by adding a second battery, improving its fuel efficiency by increasing
the distance it runs on electricity alone.[137]

The PRIUS+ Project run by CalCars made the first conversion of a Toyota Prius
to plug-in,[138] and also offers conversion instructions for do-it-
yourselfers.

Toyota has received government approval to run on public roads for tests.
Researchers at the Advanced Power and Energy Program at the University of
California, Irvine and the Institute of Transportation Studies at the
University of California, Berkeley will begin testing two specially made Prius
and analyze driver behavior, study air quality and energy use.[139] However,
electric-only driving range remains limited to around seven miles (eleven
kilometers) per charge in all-electric mode at up to 100 kilometers per hour
(62 miles per hour).[140]
