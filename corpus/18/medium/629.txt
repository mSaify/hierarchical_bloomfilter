## [edit] Biography

### [edit] Early life

Pharrell Williams was born on April 5, 1973 in Virginia Beach, Virginia.[1][2]
He was born eldest of three sons to Carolyn, a teacher, and Pharoah Williams,
a handyman.[3] He met Chad Hugo in a seventh grade summer band camp where
Williams played the keyboards and drums and Hugo played tenor saxophone. They
were also both members of a marching band; Williams played the snare drum
while Chad took the role of student conductor.[4][5] Along with Hugo, Williams
attended Princess Anne High School where they played in the school band.[6]

In the 1990s, Hugo and Williams formed a 4-piece "R&B type" group along with
friends Shay Haley and Mike Etheridge, which they named The Neptunes. They
later entered a high school talent show where they were discovered by Teddy
Riley, whose studio is next to Princess Anne High School.[7] After graduating
from high school, they signed with Riley as a group.[8]

### [edit] 1992â2001: Early career

Through working with Teddy Riley, Williams went on to write a verse for
Wreckx-N-Effect's 1992 hit "Rump Shaker".[9] That same year, he also performed
a small rap solo on SWV's second hit, "Right Here (Human Nature Remix)". In
1994, Hugo and Williams had established themselves formally as a production
duo under the previously used name "The Neptunes", and produced "Tonight's The
Night" from Blackstreet's self-titled debut. Over the next three years they
continued to produce occasionally. Some of the production had little
resemblance to the trademark Neptunes sound present today. However, some like
Mase's 1997 song "Lookin' At Me" from his album Harlem World, and the most
definite beginning of the so-called distinctive "Neptunes sound", came with
N.O.R.E.'s "Superthug" in 1998, reaching number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100,
and gaining them widespread attention for the first time. In 1999, the duo
then worked heavily with Kelis, producing her first album Kaleidoscope in its
entirety and Ol' Dirty Bastard's Nigga Please, followed by Mystikal's hit
single, "Shake Ya Ass".

### [edit] 2001â2004: In Search Of..., Clipse and Fly or Die

In 2001, The Neptunes produced Britney Spears' single, "I'm a Slave 4 U"
gaining their first world-wide number one.[10] The same year, N.E.R.D,
consisting of Williams, Hugo and Haley, released their first album, In Search
Of..., in Europe, where the first Kelis album was better received. The album
sounded very much like their previous production work; the group decided that
they should make their work as N.E.R.D sound different, and re-recorded the
album, with the rock band Spymob. Williams and Hugo met rap duo Clipse in
Virginia Beach in 1993, where they were signed to Arista Records through
Williams' Star Trak Entertainment imprint.[11][12]

Then in 2002 their re-produced album was released worldwide, and The Neptunes
reached number one in the U.S. with Nelly's single, "Hot in Herre". In August
of the same year, The Neptunes were named "Producers of the Year" at both The
Source Awards and the Billboard Music Awards. Clipse released their commercial
debut album, Lord Willin' in August 2002. The album opened at number one on
the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number four on the Billboard
200, fueled by the strength of its first two singles, "Grindin'" and "When the
Last Time", which peaked at number 34 and number 19 respectively on the
Billboard Hot 100.

The Neptunes released a self-credited album called The Neptunes Present...
Clones in 2003, featuring songs and remixes from various artists. This album
topped the U.S. Billboard 200 Albums Chart. The Neptunes and Williams
specifically were also kept in public eye largely due to ties with Jay-Z,
producing several hit singles for him and landing two tracks on his album The
Black Album. The track "Frontin'" was a big hit (the 34th biggest single of
2003 according to Billboard magazine). A survey in August 2003 found the
Neptunes produced almost 20 percent of songs played on British radio at the
time, a survey in the US had them at 43 percent.[4] The same year, The
Neptunes remixed the Daft Punk song Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger for the
duo's poorly-received remix album Daft Club. The track also featured a brief
rap section performed by Williams.

N.E.R.D's second funk rock-oriented album, Fly or Die, released in March 2004.
Williams' rock credentials were further bolstered by his appearance at the
2004 Grammy Awards, performing The Beatles' "I Saw Her Standing There" on
drums along with Sting, Dave Matthews, and Vince Gill. Williams went home with
two Grammy Awards that night, one for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, and
another for Best Pop Vocal Album for his work on Justin Timberlake's hit album
Justified. They also gained their first UK number one, again with Nelly, and
Flap Your Wings.

### [edit] 2005âpresent: Debut album and collaborations

On September 9, 2005, Williams performed the opening single from his debut
solo album In My Mind, "Can I Have It Like That", featuring Gwen Stefani. The
single did poorly in the US, reaching only number 48. It fared better in the
UK, reaching number three. Between then and the July 25, 2006 release of "In
My Mind", he released "Angel" (in Europe only), and later "Number One" with
Kanye West. Several songs leaked to the internet before the album release,
most notably "Mamacita" featuring Daddy Yankee, which was subsequently cut
from the final version. "That Girl" featuring Snoop Dogg was the final single.

In 2006, Williams solely produced Clipse's second album Hell Hath No Fury.
Most critics labeled the album to be Williams's best production in years, and
put the Virginia rap duo back in the charts.[13]

On May 16, 2007, for seven days only, the first of two expected collaborations
with Madonna, entitled "Hey You", was made available for free download from
the MSN website. MSN, in conjunction with Madonna, donated 25 cents for each
of the first one million downloads to the Alliance for Climate Protection, in
support of Live Earth. [14] Later that year, Williams performed songs at the
Concert for Diana on July 1, 2007. Then, on July 7 2007, he performed at the
Brazilian leg of Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro.

A second album, entitled Out of My Mind, was recorded with his newly formed
band "The Yessirs" featuring Questlove of The Roots. However, Williams' record
label did not think that a companion album to the first would sell well.[15]
He also produced BeyoncÃ©'s rendition of "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend".
He then wrote and produced "Why Should I Be Sad" on Britney Spears' fifth
studio album, Blackout. He also produced two songs from The Hives album, The
Black and White Album, titled "Well All Right!" and "T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.".

In April 2008, Madonna released her eleventh album, Hard Candy, which featured
vocals from Williams and production from The Neptunes on several tracks. Later
in June, an article in NME revealed that Williams is very interested in
producing The Strokes' fourth album.[16] Williams, along with other musicians,
is to work on a remix album for Maroon 5's Call & Response.[17] In 2008,
Pharrell begin work with Colombian artist Shakira to help her with the release
of her sixth studio album due to this year (2009).

## [edit] Musical style

Williams has a vocal range of a countertenor.[2] Critics often say that
Williams has the inability to rap or sing,[18][19][20] but point out that his
singing is better than his rapping.[21] Alasdair Lees of The Independent felt
that Williams "strives for the Prince effect", but sounds like Bobby Valentino
"on work experience".[20] Anthony Henriques of PopMatters noted that Williams
is not "technically gifted rapper", "does not have a beautiful voice" and his
lyrics are "typically inconsequential in a 'saying shit just to sound cool'
sort of way", but found strengths in his choruses, which he pointed out
"typically use a catchy phrase or recognizable melody as an anchor for his
nonsensical verses".[22]

Williams has encompassed a broad range of genres, including hip hop, R&B, pop,
rock and funk.[1][23] His lyrics often pertain to his childhood, family,
religious faith, money and sexuality.[24] In the album review for Seeing
Sounds by N.E.R.D, Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone felt he learned nothing
from his lyrics except that Williams was sexually aroused.[25]

## [edit] Ventures

Williams met Nigo, a Japanese record producer and creator of the clothing line
A Bathing Ape, in Japan and bonded through similar interests, where they began
working together on their fashion lines.[2] Williams later co-founded the
clothing brands Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream Footwear. In 2008,
Williams co-designed a series of glasses and jewelry for Louis Vuitton.[26] He
has also worked on furniture with Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin and a French
manufacturer, Domeau & PÃ©rÃ¨s. One of his works, a molded plastic seat with
human legs, was created because he "wanted to know what it was like to be in
love." The chair depicts a sexual scene with a pair of female legs and male
legs.[27]

## [edit] Personal life

Williams drives a Ferrari Enzo[28][29][30] and a Mercedes SLR McLaren, often
wears a trucker hat,[31] was voted the "Best Dressed Man in the World" in 2005
by Esquire magazine.[32] He is a fan of the science fiction series Star Trek,
[33] as indicated by his consistent use of the Vulcan salute to signify his
label name, Star Trak. He also enjoys the works of the late astronomer and
science lecturer Carl Sagan, whom he calls "a genius".[34] Williams has a
half-pipe inside his home.[35]
