Metal Gear Solid (ã¡ã¿ã«ã®ã¢ã½ãªãã ,Metaru Gia Soriddo?) (commonly
abbreviated as MGS) is a stealth action video game directed and written by
Hideo Kojima.[5] The game was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan
and first published by Konami in 1998 for the PlayStation video game console.
It is the sequel to Kojima's early MSX2 computer games Metal Gear and Metal
Gear 2: Solid Snake. The game featured an unprecedented amount of cinematic
cut scenes rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, as well as voice
acting in numerous codec sequences.[6]

The story of Metal Gear Solid takes place in 2005, south-west of Alaska in the
Bering sea. It follows Solid Snake, a retired soldier who infiltrates a
nuclear weapons disposal facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from
FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit.[7] Snake must liberate two hostages,
the head of DARPA and the president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the
terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike.[8]

Metal Gear Solid was well-received, shipping more than six million copies,[9]
and scoring an average of 94 out of 100 on the aggregate website
Metacritic.[10] The commercial success of the title prompted the release of an
expanded version for the PlayStation and PC, titled Metal Gear Solid:
Integral;[11] and a remake, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes was later
released for the Nintendo GameCube.[12][13] The game has also spawned numerous
sequels, prequels, a port of the game to Windows PCs and spin-offs, including
several games, a radio drama, comics, and a novel.

## [edit] Gameplay

Despite a transition to 3D, the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid remains similar
to its 2D MSX2 predecessor Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. The player must navigate
the protagonist, Solid Snake, through the game's areas without being detected
by enemies.[14] Detection is triggered by the player moving into an enemy's
field of vision and sets off an alarm that draws armed enemies to his
location.[15] This also triggers "alert mode" and the player must then hide
and remain undetected, at which point âevasion modeâ begins and once the
counter reaches zero the game returns to "infiltration mode" where enemies are
not suspicious of Snakeâs presence. The radar cannot be used in alert or
evasion mode.[16]

To remain undetected, the player can perform techniques which make use of
Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects,
using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to
distract enemies. These are carried out using the third-person camera; which
often changes its angle to give the player the best view of the area possible,
and an on-screen radar, which displays enemies and their field of vision.[17]
Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles
or a cardboard box disguise.[18] The emphasis on stealth promotes a less
violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often
result in serious damage for the player.[19]

Intermixed with the player's progress are cut scenes and codec conversations
as well as encounters with bosses. To progress, players must discover the
weaknesses of each boss to defeat them. Game controls and play strategies can
also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's
support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving
his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which
buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec is also used to provide exposition
on the game's backstory. Completion of the title provides the player with a
statistical summary of their performance, and a "code name" based upon it,
typically the name of a common animal.

In a first for the Metal Gear series, a training mode is available in which
players can practice hiding techniques, weapons use, and sneaking. In addition
to the stealth gameplay, there are set piece sequences that entail firefights
between the player and enemies from the third-person and first-person
perspectives.[16]

## [edit] Plot

### [edit] Characters

Main article: List of Metal Gear Solid characters

The protagonist of Metal Gear Solid is Solid Snake, a legendary infiltrator
and saboteur. His physique is based on Jean Claude Van Damme, while his facial
appearance was originally based on Christopher Walken.[20][21] During the
mission, Snake receives support and advice via codec radio. Colonel Roy
Campbell, Solid Snake's former commanding officer, supports Snake with advice
and tactics. While he initially keeps a number of secrets from Snake, he
gradually reveals them.[22] He is joined by Naomi Hunter, who gives medical
advice; Nastasha Romanenko, who provides item and weapon tips; Master Miller,
a former drill instructor and survival coach; and Mei Ling, who invented the
soliton radar system used in the mission and is also in charge of mission data
- the player can call her to save the game.

The main antagonist of the game is Liquid Snake, leader of the now-terrorist
organization FOXHOUND, and genetic counterpart to Solid Snake.[16] An elite
special forces unit, FOXHOUND contains experts specializing in unique tasks.
Members are Revolver Ocelot, a Western-style gunslinger and expert
interrogator whose weapon of choice is the Colt Single Action Army; Sniper
Wolf, a preternatural sniper; Vulcan Raven, a hulking Alaskan shaman armed
with an M61 Vulcan torn from a downed F-16; Psycho Mantis, a psychic profiler
and psychokinesis expert; and Decoy Octopus, a master of disguise.[16]

Other characters include Meryl Silverburgh, initially known as Roy Campbell's
niece, and a rookie soldier stationed in Shadow Moses who did not join the
revolt; Dr. Hal "Otacon" Emmerich, the lead developer of Metal Gear REX; and
the Cyborg Ninja, a mysterious cybernetically-enhanced agent who is neither an
ally nor an enemy of Snake but does oppose FOXHOUND.[16]

### [edit] Story

Metal Gear series fictional chronology  
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater  
Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops  
Metal Gear  
Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake  
Metal Gear Solid (The Twin Snakes)  
Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty  
Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots  
The story is set in 2005,[23] where a genetically enhanced next-generation
special forces unit commanded by FOXHOUND lead an armed uprising on a remote
island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago. This island, codenamed Shadow Moses, is
the site of a nuclear weapons disposal facility.[19] The forces that seized
this island have acquired the nuclear-capable mecha Metal Gear REX, and are
threatening the US government with a nuclear reprisal if they do not receive
the remains of the "legendary mercenary" Big Boss within 24 hours.[24]

As the game begins, Solid Snake is forced out of retirement and is dispatched
at the request of Colonel Roy Campbell to penetrate the terrorists' defenses
and neutralize the threat.[25] Snake is also ordered to locate hostages DARPA
Chief Donald Anderson, and ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker. Colonel
Campbell's niece, Meryl Silverburgh is also held captive in the facility after
refusing to take part in the uprising. Snake enters the facility via an air
vent and eventually locates the DARPA Chief in a cell. He informs Snake of the
new Metal Gear REX unit housed at the facility and how he can prevent it from
being launched using a secret detonation override code, but then suddenly dies
of what appears to be a heart attack.[26] Meryl, who is held in adjoining
cell, manages to break out and assists Snake in his escape as enemy soldiers
are alerted to his presence. Snake then finds the other hostage, Kenneth
Baker. Whilst attempting to free Baker, Snake is confronted by Revolver Ocelot
who challenges Snake to a gunfight, which is interrupted by a mysterious
cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot's right hand. Baker briefs Snake on the Metal
Gear project and advises him to contact Meryl, whom he gave a PAL card that
could be used to prevent the launch, but like the DARPA Chief, he suddenly
dies of what appears to be a heart attack.

Snake then contacts Meryl via codec, and agrees to meet her in the base's
warhead disposal area on the condition that he contacts Metal Gear's designer,
Hal "Otacon" Emmerich. As he emerges onto a canyon, Snake receives an
anonymous codec call. The mysterious voice calls himself "Deepthroat" and
warns Snake of an ambush up ahead. Snake is confronted by Vulcan Raven in an
M1 tank, but manages to defeat the two gunners and proceeds to the warhead
disposal area. Snake locates Otacon in his lab. The ninja reappears, and Snake
realizes that it is actually his former ally Gray Fox, whom he believed was
killed years earlier. Otacon agrees to aid Snake remotely, using special
camouflage to procure information and supplies while he remains invisible.
Snake meets with Meryl and agrees for her to accompany him on his mission.
Meryl gives Snake the PAL card Baker gave to her and as they head for the
underground base, Meryl becomes possessed by Psycho Mantis's mind control tune
and pulls her gun on Snake. Snake disarms Meryl and defeats Psycho Mantis and
before he dies, he tells Snake that he has "a large place" in Meryl's heart
after reading her mind. After they reach the underground passageway, Sniper
Wolf ambushes them, wounds Meryl, and after a brief duel captures Snake.

While imprisoned, Liquid confirms Snake's suspicion that they are twin
brothers.[27] Snake is then tortured by Ocelot[28] and the player can choose
whether or not to give in to the torture. When Snake is taken to his cell, he
discovers the body of DARPA Chief Donald Anderson lying in the corner;
however, though it was only hours before Snake watched Anderson die in front
of him, the body has been decomposing as if he were dead for days. Eventually
Snake is able to escape by fooling the guard (by either lying in ketchup or
hiding under a bed).

As Snake makes his way up the facility's communications tower, he is ambushed
by Liquid in an attack helicopter, but swiftly defeats him. As he emerges from
the tower onto the snowfield he is confronted once again by Sniper Wolf, and
after a second duel he fatally wounds her. Otacon, enamoured with Wolf, is
overcome with grief as Snake is forced to execute her. Snake descends into the
bowels of the Shadow Moses facility. After defeating Vulcan Raven, the shaman
reveals to Snake that the man he watched die was not the DARPA Chief. It was
Decoy Octopus.[29] However, Raven leaves the cause of death for Snake to find
out. Shortly after, Master Miller calls and reveals that Dr. Naomi Hunter, a
support agent, has given Snake the genetically engineered virus "FoxDie"
during his mission preparations, and is sending coded messages into the
facility. Campbell swiftly orders her arrest. The virus, designed to kill
people with particular genetic markers via cardiac arrest,[30][31] was
responsible for the deaths of Octopus and the ArmsTech president.[32] Naomi
contacts Snake and confesses that she joined the mission to sabotage it. But
upon learning of Snake's own past, she no longer had the heart to kill him
directly having reprogrammed the virus.[33]

Infiltrating Metal Gear's hangar, Snake overhears Liquid and Ocelot preparing
the launch sequence for Metal Gear REX. Thinking he is deactivating it by
using the PAL card, Snake activates Metal Gear REX.[34] Master Miller then
reveals himself to be Liquid in disguise. He informs Snake that his entire
mission was manipulated by the renegades to allow the launch of the nuclear
weapon.[35] Liquid explains that they are the product of the Les Enfants
Terribles project, a government sponsored effort to clone Big Boss, that was
conducted during the 1970s. Liquid explains that Solid received all of Big
Boss' dominant genes, while he received all of the recessive genes.[36][37] He
also reveals to Snake the government's true reason for sending him in: the
reprogrammed FoxDie virus would kill all the members of FOXHOUND, allowing the
government to retrieve REX undamaged.

Solid Snake in battle against Metal Gear REX.

Liquid assumes control of Metal Gear REX and a battle ensues. Gray Fox
suddenly appears and destroys REX's radome and dies trying to fend off the
bipedal tank from Snake. Snake destroys Metal Gear REX and is challenged again
by Liquid in person. He fights Liquid atop REX and defeats him after knocking
him over the edge. He is then reunited with Meryl or Otacon, depending on the
player's actions. They escape through an underground tunnel, while being
chased by Liquid, in a jeep. After the two vehicles crash at the tunnel
entrance, Liquid emerges and pulls a gun on Snake but suddenly dies from the
FoxDie virus.[38] Colonel Campbell, briefly ousted from command of the
mission, calls off a nuclear airstrike intended to obliterate the evidence of
the day's events and officially declares Snake killed in action to stop the US
government's search for him in the future.

There are two possible endings, depending on the player's actions during the
torture sequence. If the player gives in to the torture, Snake discovers after
defeating Liquid that Meryl has died and escapes with Otacon. If the player
does not give in to the torture, Meryl survives and escapes with Snake while
Otacon volunteers to stay behind and sacrifice himself to help Snake and Meryl
get out, not knowing that the nuclear strike intended to hit the disposal
facility would never come (Meryl surviving is the canon ending).

After the end credits the player finds out Snake is actually genetically
inferior to Liquid[39] and has an indeterminate amount of time left before
FoxDie kills him. Ocelot is revealed to be a double agent for the President of
the United States. His intention was to obtain Baker's disk containing Metal
Gear's specifications and deliver it to the President, and kill whoever knew
of his true motives, the reason for his "accidental" killing of the DARPA
Chief.[40]

## [edit] Development

<IMG>

An early artwork of Snake and Meryl, featured as an easter egg in the
Policenauts: Pilot Disk for the 3DO.

Kojima originally planned the third Metal Gear game, to be called Metal Gear
3, and to release it for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1994. Conceptual
artwork, by illustrator Yoji Shinkawa, of the characters Solid Snake, Meryl
Silverburgh, who was also a character in the adventure game Policenauts, and
the FOXHOUND team, were included in the Policenauts: Pilot Disk preceding the
release of the full 3DO game in 1995.[41] However due to the decline of the
3DO hardware, development of the game shifted to the PlayStation shortly after
it was released.

Kojima retitled the game Metal Gear Solid, choosing this over the working
title Metal Gear 3. This was due to the fact that he believed that the first
two MSX2 games in the series were not very well known.[42] He used the word
'Solid' which was chosen due to the game being the third installment in the
series, and because it uses 3D computer graphics.[43] Sequels to this game
also use the Metal Gear Solid title, and follow a new numeral progression.

The development for Metal Gear Solid began in mid-1995[44] with the intention
of creating the "best PlayStation game ever".[45] Developers aimed for
accuracy and realism while making the game enjoyable and tense. In the early
stages of development, a SWAT team educated the creators with a demonstration
of vehicles, weapons and explosives.[45] Hideo Kojima, the director, stated
that "if the player isn't tricked into believing that the world is real, then
there's no point in making the game". To fulfill this, adjustments were made
to every detail, such as individually designed desks.[46]

Hideo Kojima created the characters of Metal Gear Solid. Modifications and
mechanics were made by conceptual artist Yoji Shinkawa. The characters were
completed by polygonal artists using pencil drawings and clay models by
Shinkawa.[47] Kojima wanted greater interaction with objects and the
environment, such as allowing the player to hide bodies in a storage
compartment. Additionally, he wanted "a full orchestra right next to the
player"; a system which made modifications such as tempo and texture to the
currently playing track, instead of switching to another pre-recorded track.
Although these features could not be achieved, they were implemented in Metal
Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.[48]

Metal Gear Solid was revealed to the public at the E3 gaming event in 1997 as
a short video. It was later playable for the first time at the Tokyo Game Show
in 1998 and officially released the same year in Japan[49] with an extensive
promotional campaign.[45] Television and magazine advertisements, in-store
samples, and demo give-aways contributed to a total of US$8 million in
promotional costs.[50] An estimated 12 million demos for the game were
distributed during 1998.[51]

## [edit] Release history

### [edit] Original version

The English version of Metal Gear Solid, translated by Jeremy Blaustein, who
localized the Sega CD version of Snatcher,[5] contains minor refinements made
during localization, such as adjustable difficulty settings, a bonus tuxedo
outfit for Snake, and a "demo theater" for viewing cut scenes and radio
conversations.[16][52] Versions of the game dubbed in Spanish, German, French
and Italian were released throughout Europe in addition to the English-dubbed
version released in America. A premium package was released in Japan and Asia
containing the game, a t-shirt, dog tags, a music CD featuring the soundtracks
to the MSX2 games, and a booklet with information about the game's production
and plot.[53] A European version of the package was also produced, featuring
different content from the Japanese version.[54]

The Japanese PlayStation version of Metal Gear Solid, as well as Integral, had
been reissued twice: once under The Best range and second time as a PSone
Books title. Likewise, the American and European versions of Metal Gear Solid
were reissued under the "Greatest Hits" and "Platinum" ranges respectively.
The game is included in the Japanese Metal Gear Solid: 20th Anniversary
Collection set[55] and in the American Essential Collection set.[56] The game
is available in Japan on the PlayStation Store for download on the PlayStation
3 and PlayStation Portable.[57]

### [edit] Integral and VR Missions

Released on June 25, 1999 for the PlayStation in Japan,[11] Metal Gear Solid:
Integral is an expanded version of the original game based on the North
American localization, substituting the original Japanese voices with the
English dub, while offering a choice between Japanese and English captions,
which adds further additional features and an extra disc of virtual reality
training missions dubbed the "VR Disc".[24] Added to the main game are an
alternate sneaking suit outfit for Meryl that complements Snake's tuxedo and
the red-colored Ninja, a "Very Easy" difficulty setting featuring a new
weapon, an MP5 submachine gun with infinite ammo, a Codec frequency with staff
commentary, a first-person view mode, an option for alternate patrol routes
for enemies and a downloadable PocketStation minigame.

The "VR Disc" features over 300 missions testing the player's sneaking and
fighting skills, as well as less conventional tests, such as murder mysteries,
battling giant genome soldiers, and three missions where the player controls
the Cyborg Ninja. Special features includes trailers for Metal Gear Solid, a
preview artwork of Metal Gear RAY from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and
a "photoshoot" mode to take pictures of Mei Ling and Naomi.[58] The VR Disc
from Integral was released as a separate product outside of Japan â in North
America as Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions[24] (September 23, 1999) and in
Europe as Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions (October 29, 1999).[59] When
loading Special Missions, the player is prompted to replace the game disk with
either of the disks from Metal Gear Solid. If the disk is correctly
identified, the player can insert the Special Missions disk and the game will
then load as normal. This requirement was absent from the American VR Missions
and Japanese VR Disc.[60] Special Missions cannot be played on pre-SCPH-70000
PlayStation 2 consoles, as it will not recognize either Metal Gear Solid disk,
but the game is compatible with other consoles.

A PC port of Integral was also released in Europe and North America in late
2000 with PocketStation support removed.[24][12][61] Scoring 83 in
Metacritic's aggregate, the game was criticized for "graphic glitches", the
aged nature of the port, and being essentially identical to the PlayStation
version.[62]

### [edit] The Twin Snakes

Main article: Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes

<IMG>

<IMG>

The ability to fire a weapon while in first-person view was one of the
gameplay features first used in Metal Gear Solid 2 that was added to The Twin
Snakes.

A remake of Metal Gear Solid, titled Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, was
developed by Silicon Knights under the supervision of Hideo Kojima and
released for the Nintendo GameCube in North America, Japan, and Europe in
March 2004.[13] While Twin Snakes was largely developed at Silicon Knights,
its cut scenes were developed in-house at Konami and directed by Japanese film
director Ryuhei Kitamura, reflecting his dynamic signature style, utilizing
bullet time photography and choreographed gunplay extensively.[63] While the
storyline and settings of the game were unchanged (although a select few lines
of dialog were re-written), a variety of gameplay features from Sons of
Liberty were added such as the first person aiming and hanging from bars on
walls. Another change in the English voice acting was the reduction of Mei
Ling's, Naomi's and Nastasha's accents, as well as the recasting of the Ninja
from Greg Eagles, who reprised the role of the DARPA chief, to Rob Paulsen.
The graphics were also updated.[64]

## [edit] Music

Main article: Metal Gear Solid Original Game Soundtrack

The musical score of Metal Gear Solid was composed by Konami in-house
musicians, including Kazuki Muraoka, who also worked on Metal Gear.[65]
Composer and lyricist Rika Muranaka provided a song called "The Best is Yet To
Come". The main theme from MGS was called "An Cuimheann leat an Gra" which
translated means "Do you remember the love?"[66] for the game's ending credits
sequence.[67] The song is performed in Irish by Aoife NÃ­ Fhearraigh.[68] The
main theme was composed by TAPPY and was also used in Ape Escape 3.[69] Music
played in-game has a synthetic feel with increased pace and introduction of
strings during tense moments, with a looping style endemic to video games.
Overtly cinematic music, with stronger orchestral and choral elements, appears
in cutscenes. The soundtrack was released on September 23, 1998, under the
King Records label.[70]

GameSpot 8.5/10.[74]  
IGN 9.8/10[75]  
NGamer 9/10[76]  
Metal Gear Solid was a commercial success, shipping over 6 million copies
worldwide.[9] Upon release, it was one of the most rented games,[77] and
topped sales charts in the United Kingdom.[78]

The game was very well received by the media and some of the most prominent
gaming critics. NGamer said "It's like playing a big budget action
blockbuster, only better".[76] Gaming website IGN awarded the game 9.8 out of
10 and said it came "closer to perfection than any other game in PlayStation's
action genre" and called it "Beautiful, engrossing, and innovative...in every
conceivable category".[79] Users and critics of GamePro gave it an average
score of 4.8 out of 5 calling it "this season's top offering [game] and one
game no self-respecting gamer should be without". But they criticized the
frame rate, saying it "occasionally stalls the eye-catching graphics" and
"Especially annoying are instances where you zoom in with binoculars or the
rifle scope", and also the interruptions of "advice from your team", in the
early parts of the game, calling it an "annoyance".[80] GameSpot also
criticized this, saying "It needlessly interrupts the game". They also
criticized how easy it is for the player to avoid being seen, the game's short
length, and called it "more of a work of art than ... an actual game".[74]
Further criticism came from the website Adrenaline Vault, which said it had
"some serious...flaws" which "made it a complete disappointment".[10] It
received an Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1998 Japan Media Arts
Festival.[81]

Metal Gear Solid is often recognized for popularizing the stealth game genre.
The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies
rather than fight them has been used in many games since. It is also sometimes
acclaimed as being a film as much as a game due to the lengthy cut scenes and
complicated storyline.[82] Entertainment Weekly said it "broke new ground
with...movie-style production...and stealth-driven gameplay, which
encouraged...hiding in boxes and crawling across floors".[83] GameTrailers
said it "invented the stealth game" and called it "captivating, inventive and
gritty".[84] The game is often considered one of the best games for the
PlayStation, and has featured in best video games lists by GameFAQs,[85] Game
Rankings,[86] Japanese magazine Famitsu,[87] Entertainment Weekly,[83] Game
Informer,[88] GamePro,[89] Electronic Gaming Monthly[90] and GameTrailers.[84]
However, its placing in these lists is inconsistent, ranging from 2nd to
50th.[91]

In 2002 IGN's editors ranked it as the best PlayStation game ever. Writer for
the site David Smith said that just the demo for the game had "more gameplay
[in it] than in most finished titles". They also gave it the "Best Ending" and
"Best Villain" awards.[92] In 2005, in placing it 19th on their list of "Top
100 Games", they said that it was "a game that truly felt like a movie", that
the fights were "unique and innovative", and that it was "the founder of the
stealth genre".[93][94]  

Guinness World Records awarded Metal Gear Solid with a record for the "Most
Innovative Use of a Video Game Controller" for the boss fight with Psycho
Mantis in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008 edition.

## [edit] Related media

A Japanese radio drama version of Metal Gear Solid was produced shortly after
the release of the original PlayStation game. Directed by Shuyo Murata and
written by Motosada Mori, 18 episodes were aired, from 1998 to 1999 on
Konami's CLUB db program. The series was later released on CD as a two volume
set.[95][96] Set after the events of the PlayStation game, Snake, Meryl,
Campbell and Mei Ling (all portrayed by their original Japanese voice actors)
pursue missions in hostile third world nations as FOXHOUND. The new characters
introduced include Sgt. Allen Iishiba (voiced by Toshio Furukawa), a Delta
Force operative who assists Snake and Meryl; Col. Mark Cortez (v.b. Osamu
Saka), an old friend of Campbell who commands the fictional Esteria Army
Special Forces; and Capt. Sergei Ivanovich (v.b. Kazuhiro Nakata), a former
war buddy of Revolver Ocelot from his SVR days.[97][98]

As of 2006, 12 issues have been published, fully covering the Metal Gear Solid
storyline.[101]

The comic was adapted into a PlayStation Portable game titled Metal Gear
Solid: Digital Graphic Novel (Metal Gear Solid: Bande DessinÃ©e in
Japan).[102] It features visual enhancements and two interactive modes
designed to give further insight into the publication.[103] Upon viewing the
pages, the player can open a "scanning" interface to search for characters and
items in a three dimensional view.[103] Discoveries are added to a database
which can be traded with other players via Wi-Fi. The "mission mode" allows
the player to add collected information into a library. This information must
be properly connected to complete a mission. Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic
Novel was released in North America on June 13, 2006, Japan on September 21
and the PAL region on September 22.[104] In 2006, the game received IGN's
award for Best Use of Sound on the PSP.[105] A DVD-Video version is included
with its sequel (Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande DessinÃ©e), which was released in
Japan on June 12, 2008. The DVD version features full voice acting.[106]

A novelization based on the original Metal Gear Solid was written by Raymond
Benson and published by Del Rey. The American paperback edition was published
on May 27, 2008,[107] and the British Edition on June 5, 2008.[108]

Creator Hideo Kojima confirmed in 2006 that a film adaptation of Metal Gear
Solid was in development.[109] He also hinted that the movie may be set in
Alaska, the original setting for the game.[110] Despite pitching his ideas
regarding the movie, voice of Solid Snake, David Hayter, will not be writing
the final script or directing the film.[111] The movie's producers hoped to
invite Kurt Wimmer to write the movie, but the final decision has not yet been
announced.[112]

Also, most of the people don't know that there is a Metal Gear 1 and 2 for the MSX, and I wanted it to be the sequel for those. And, of course, Solid from Solid Snake."
