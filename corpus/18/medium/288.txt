Main article: List of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip characters

### [edit] Major roles

Studio 60 employed a broad ensemble cast that portrayed the rotating personnel
involved in the production of a late-night comedy show.

  * Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) is a former segment producer for Studio 60 who is asked to return as Director/Executive Producer when Executive Producer Wes Mendell is fired. He works closely with Matt Albie, his longtime friend. He is a recovering drug addict.

  * Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) is an "effortlessly sexy," "multi-talented"[1] performer, a devout Christian, and one of the "Big Three" main stars of Studio 60. She is also Matt Albie's on-again-off-again girlfriend. She also dated Luke Scott, a former writer at Studio 60 and Matt's rival, now a big-time director. The character of Harriet is partially based on Kristin Chenoweth, whom Sorkin previously dated before she worked on The West Wing.
  * Tom Jeter (Nate Corddry) is another of the show's "Big Three." He is from the Midwest and his brother is serving as an Airman in the USAF deployed in Afghanistan. During the course of the show, he begins dating Lucy, one of the staff writers.
  * Simon Stiles (D. L. Hughley) is the final member of the "Big Three." An alumnus of the Yale School of Drama, his original intention was to become a dramatic actor, rather than a comedian.

  * Samantha Li (Camille Chen) is a member of the show's ensemble.
  * Ricky Tahoe (Evan Handler) is a former co-executive producer of the show and former head of the writers' room. In "The Option Period", he and Ron left Studio 60 to pursue a pilot show for Fox called "Peripheral Vision Man" â based on a character from an old Studio 60 sketch ; Ricky's departure was marked by a hostile shouting match with Matt.
  * Ron Oswald (Carlos Jacott) is a former co-executive producer of the show and former head of the writers' room. In "The Option Period", he left the show with Ricky to pursue a pilot show for Fox called "Peripheral Vision Man" â based on a character from an old Studio 60 sketch.

During the course of the show, Lucy begins dating Tom Jeter.
  * Darius Hawthorne (Columbus Short) is Matt's assistant writer. Matt and Simon hired Darius after seeing his poor stand-up act in "The Wrap Party." During "The Harriet Dinner" he has fights with Simon because Darius passed a sketch, pitched by Simon, to Lucy.

Andy was a writer on Studio 60 prior to Matt and Danny's initial departure from the show. Since that time, Andy's wife and daughter died in a car accident. Andy is very serious negative person, and has only been seen smiling once.
  * Martha O'Dell (Christine Lahti) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist working on a story for Vanity Fair about the new leadership of Studio 60.

## [edit] History of the show-within-the-show

Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip premiered in 1986, created by veteran comedy
writer Wes Mendell, who had written for such comedy greats as the Smothers
Brothers, Bill Cosby, and Richard Pryor.

By 1999, Wes had set up a system where he, as head writer, wrote most of his
material solo, while assistant head writer Joe was left in charge of the
writersâ room, where the rest of the writers would brainstorm and submit
ideas they had come up with individually. This was the year in which Wes hired
two unknowns who would eventually become members of the âBig Three,â the
three most popular and powerful cast members: Yale School of Drama graduate
Simon Stiles, and improv veteran Harriet Hayes. Harrietâs addition to the
cast was especially important, since it attracted the attention of two
freshman writers, Luke Scott and Matthew âMattâ Albie, neither of whom had
yet been able to get a sketch on the air. Luke and Matt quickly developed a
rivalry for Harrietâs affections, which they expressed partially by writing
material specifically for her. Although Luke was the one who succeeded in
writing Harrietâs debut sketch, it was Matt Albie whose writing made her a
star. Harriet alternately dated both writers, until Luke left, having fallen
into Mattâs shadow; Luke soon became a success as a director and writer for
motion pictures.

By 2001, Studio 60 had become the flagship show of NBS, impressionist Tom
Jeter rounded out the Big Three, and Matt had become enough of a success that
he had replaced Joe as asst. head writer. When Wes was temporarily taken out
of the picture by a cigarette-related heart attack, he left the show in the
hands of Matt and his favorite segment producer, Daniel âDannyâ Tripp.
Matt & Danny strenuously objected to having to produce a season premiere in
the immediate wake of September 11, but their objections were overruled by
network chairman Jack Rudolph. Jack gave them strict instructions to stay away
from "anti-American" political satire and to focus on Hollywood. Matt wrote an
opening sketch satirizing a meeting between Karl Rove and movie executives.
Jack objected to the sketch, while Matt defended it because it made fun of
Hollywood. Making a deal with Jack, Danny and Matt agreed to pull the sketch
if the representatives of their sponsors objected after seeing the dress
rehearsal. None of the sponsors objected, the sketch made it onto the show,
and there was an immediate conservative backlash. As a result, Jack threatened
to fire Matt and Danny unless they apologized for the sketch. They refused to
apologize and expected Wes to stand up for their decision. Instead, Wes
decided to issue an apology on the show's behalf. Realizing Wes had buckled
under perceived pressure from the network, Matt and Danny quit the show.

These decisions caused Wes to begin doubting himself, and by 2006, he had more
or less unofficially handed artistic control of the show over to assistant
head writers Ricky & Ron, best known for their unfunny recurring sketch
âPeripheral Vision Man.â Prolific but untalented, Ricky & Ron led the show
into an artistic slump. When Wes tried to shake things up by opening the new
season with âCrazy Christians,â a sketch that was written by Matt before
he quit, he was overruled by Standards & Practices. Wes responded by
interrupting the opening sketch with a live, on-air rant about network
sensibilities and how they had sapped the quality out of Studio 60 and
television in general. The network, under the leadership of newly appointed
president Jordan McDeere, responded by firing Wes and bringing back Danny
Tripp as executive producer and Matt Albie as executive producer and head
writer.

During their time away from Studio 60 Matt & Danny found success as a
writer/director filmmaking team, a success culminating with a WGA award for
Matt. Still stung by the betrayal of Wes and angry at Jack for refusing to
side with their artistic integrity five years earlier, Matt & Danny
nevertheless accepted the job as show runners when Danny failed a drug test
and thus could not get insured for their next movie.

Mattâs return to the show reunited him with Harriet, with whom he had
recently broken up. This reunion, coupled with Harrietâs casting in Lukeâs
latest movie, reignited Luke and Mattâs rivalry for Harrietâs affections.
Meanwhile, Danny began to develop a romance with Jordan McDeere, who continued
to rile Jack with her distaste for unscripted television and commitment to
cerebral programming.

In the writing room, Matt benched Ricky & Ron, partially in retaliation for a
post-9/11 snub, but mostly because Matt held the nearly-universally shared
view that Ricky & Ron were hack writers. Bitter, Ricky & Ron walked out to
write for the FOX network production of their optioned Peripheral Vision Man,
taking with them all but two of the writing staff. The only writers remaining
included Matt as the head writer; the inexperienced Lucy Kenwright, who had
never had a sketch on air; and the unsuccessful stand-up comedian Darius
Hawthorne, whom Matt had only recently hired in response to Simonâs request
for more black writers on the show. Realizing that they desperately needed
help, Matt hired veteran Studio 60 writer Andy Mackinaw as a writing advisor.
Andy, who had retired from comedy after his family was killed in a car
accident, then decided to remain on staff as asst. head writer.

## [edit] U.S. scheduling

On December 2, 2006, NBC announced that Studio 60 would be sharing the Monday
at 10 p.m. timeslot with The Black Donnellys. To accommodate this NBC
scheduled Studio 60 to take a 7 week hiatus between December 4, 2006 and
January 22, 2007.[3] It was then scheduled to run non-stop until February 26,
2007 when it would take another hiatus.[4]

### [edit] Hiatus

On February 13, 2007, NBC announced that Studio 60 would go on hiatus one week
early and that the last episode would air on February 19, 2007. This is at
least partially due to the show delivering its lowest ratings to date on the
Monday preceding the announcement.[5]

During the hiatus on NBC, The Black Donnellys (premiered February 26), Thank
God You're Here (premiered April 9), The Real Wedding Crashers (premiered
April 23, after Thank God You're Here moved to Wednesdays[6][7]), and Law and
Order: Criminal Intent (aired its last two episodes of the season starting May
14) occupied the Monday 10 p.m. time period.

On April 2, 2007, NBC announced that Studio 60 would not reclaim its Monday at
10 p.m. time slot at the conclusion of The Black Donnellys run and that The
Real Wedding Crashers, a reality show based on the popular movie, would occupy
the timeslot from April 23, 2007 through the end of the TV season. However, on
April 26, NBC announced that Studio 60 would return from its hiatus on
Thursday, May 24 at 10:00 p.m.

### [edit] Cancellation

Many rumors circulated for months regarding the cancellation of the show, and
as of October 30, 2008, the official show website ceased to exist.[8]

## [edit] Critical and public reaction

Studio 60, previously known as Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip during its
development stage (and likely renamed because of Studio 7, a game show which
aired on The WB in 2004), was already the subject of much discussion before
its first episode had aired. NBC and CBS had staged an intense bidding war for
the rights to the show in October 2005, with NBC agreeing to a "near-record
license fee" in order to obtain the rights.[9] It was the show most
anticipated by media buyers prior to the network upfront presentations,
according to MediaLife.[10] Among the online public the show was also highly
anticipated, receiving the most online "mentions" and the most positive
sentiment of any new 2006 show.[11] The positive reception extended to
television critics, who named it their "Best Overall New Program" in a poll
conducted by Broadcasting and Cable,[12] based on the pilot episode. In their
2006 year end issue, NY Daily News listed Studio 60 as number 6 on their best
"Series of the Year" list, and was also listed in best standout performances
as number 9 for Matthew Perry.[13] Glenn Garvin of the Miami Herald named
Studio 60 as number 2 on his list of best "Series of the Year."[14] Studio 60
earned a collective rating of 75 out of 100 based on 33 reviews by TV critics
and received 8.2 out of 10 from 276 votes by users on Metacritic.[15]

The pilot was seen by an average of 13.4 million total viewers in its initial
airing on NBC, although it experienced significant viewer falloff from the
first half-hour to the second half-hour,[16] and the second episode's Nielsen
ratings were down by 12% from the pilot.[17] The erosion continued through
episode 5, with a 43% viewer drop off from its premiere, but subsequently
leveled off. (See U.S. television ratings below.)

On October 27, 2006, NBC gave a conditional "vote of confidence" by ordering
three additional scripts on top of the initial order of 13.[18] Despite the
order, Studio 60 performed poorly in the ratings, which led to speculation
that the network was seriously considering canceling the show.

Roger Friedman of Fox News reported on October 30, 2006, that cancellation of
the show was imminent.[19] This was denied the next day by an NBC
representative who stated that the show "is profitable at this point" and that
rather than a cancellation, it is more likely that the show's time slot will
change.[20]

On November 9, 2006, NBC announced that the show had been picked up for a full
season, citing its favorable demographics as the reason.[21] According to
NBC's press release: "Studio 60 has consistently delivered some of the highest
audience concentrations among all primetime network series in such key upscale
categories as adults 18-49 living in homes with $75,000-plus and $100,000-plus
incomes and in homes where the head of household has four or more years of
college."

In its December 17, 2006, issue, Time listed Studio 60 as one of "5 Things
That Went From Buzz to Bust", sharing the distinction with other "phenomena
that captivated the media for a spell, then turned out to be less than
huge."[22] Entertainment Weekly named Studio 60 the worst TV show of 2006.[23]
Comedy writers have been largely disdainful of Studio 60, with comments like
"People in television, trust me, are not that smart", "(Sorkin) wants to get
big ideas across and change people's minds. No comedians work that way. They
go for the laughs first and the lesson second", and "(Saturday Night Live) is
so dark, they could never show what actually happens there."[24]

On July 19, 2007, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced their
nominations for the 2007 Primetime Emmy awards. Studio 60 was nominated in
five categories. The pilot episode earned three nominations: Outstanding
Directing (Thomas Schlamme), Outstanding Cinematography For A Single-camera
Series, and Outstanding Casting in Dramatic Series. Both John Goodman and Eli
Wallach were nominated Outstanding Guest actor in Dramatic Series. Even with
some criticism, Studio 60 nominations surpassed critics' darlings such as
Friday Night Lights and Dexter, which got two and three respectively. The show
also tied with hits like CSI and 24.

## [edit] Influences on the show

The pilot both alludes heavily and refers directly to the film Network. In
early development, Studio 60's fictional network NBS was called UBS, as was
the corporation in Network.

As is typical for Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme, the crew contains a number
of people linked to their previous shows (Sports Night and The West Wing).
Bradley Whitford, Timothy Busfield, John Goodman, Evan Handler and Matthew
Perry all have a history with The West Wing. Busfield directed two episodes of
Sports Night as well. The show's first guest host (appearing as herself) is
Felicity Huffman, who starred in Sports Night and did a guest spot on The West
Wing.

Sorkin draws from his own experience as a writer in creating the characters.
In "The Focus Group", Ron mentions, "Nobody can write 90 minutes of television
every week by themselves. They'd be dead by the sixth show." Sorkin is known
for having singlehandedly written a majority of the episodes during the first
four seasons of The West Wing.

The show also uses the now familiar "Walk and Talks" (also called
"pedeconferencing" in fan circles) used so frequently in both previous shows
as well.

The Harriet/Matt relationship is based on Sorkin's relationship with Kristin
Chenoweth, who played Annabeth Schott on The West Wing.[25] In Studio 60's
pilot, one of the reasons that Matt and Harriet broke up was Harriet's
decision to appear on The 700 Club to support her Christian music album. In
2005, Chenoweth made a similar appearance on The 700 Club, sparking a negative
reaction from some of her gay fans because of the views of 700 Club host Pat
Robertson.[26] Unlike Matt and Harriet, Sorkin and Chenoweth did not work
together on The West Wing. Sorkin left after The West Wing's fourth season and
Chenoweth joined the cast during season six.

The Jordan McDeere character is loosely based on former ABC Entertainment
President Jamie Tarses, who is a consultant on the show.[27]

The conflict between NBS and the Federal Communications Commission regarding
uncensored language of American soldiers in the Middle East parallels the
decision by a small number of PBS affiliates to air the documentary "Operation
Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience" in full, despite potentially hefty
FCC fines for unedited obscenities used by American soldiers describing their
experiences in Iraq.[28]

On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research reported the results of having,
for the first time, monitored viewers who use a Digital Video Recorder to pre-
record shows for later viewing. According to the Nielsen numbers, adding these
viewers increased Studio 60's ratings the most in percentage terms of all
network shows. These ratings, called "live plus seven", include all viewers
who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its
initial airing.

According to Nielsen, Studio 60 adds nearly 11%, or almost a million viewers,
to its total every week as a result of these "live plus seven" viewers.[35]

According to Medialife Magazine, "The live-plus-seven-day rating for NBCâs
âStudio 60 on the Sunset Stripâ is 136% higher than its live rating in DVR
homes."[36]

## [edit] Alternative availability

Studio 60 was one of a group of NBC shows during its season, some new and some
returning, which was available on one or both of NBC's online forums for
alternative distribution of television: free with commercials on NBC.com and
hulu.com, and for pay download without commercials at Amazon.com and the
iTunes Store. Studio 60 was also added as a download option via the Xbox 360
video download service. There is no published record of its popularity at the
NBC website or on the Xbox, but several Studio 60 episodes have been among the
ten most popular on iTunes. The Studio 60 season pass has also steadily
remained in the Top 20 since it was made available. The first nine episodes of
Studio 60 were also made available on the launch of Xbox Live Media Downloads
in fall of 2006, and the service continues to offer the new episodes weekly
(3â4 days after the airdate). All episodes of the program have also been
made available on CTV's online broadband network. Episodes are currently being
added to the Channel 4's 4oD, a broadband on-demand service, in the UK, as the
episodes are broadcast on More 4.

### [edit] Early release

NBC made the pilot episode of Studio 60 available on DVD to Netflix
subscribers on August 5, 2006. The DVD also includes the pilot episode for
Kidnapped, another show which aired on NBC in the fall and also got canceled.
AOL also premiered the first episode of Studio 60 in its entirety on its
online television channel.

The pilot episode was screened to the general public for the first time at the
31st MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival, a British
industry and media event held annually over the August bank holiday weekend
(25-27 August 2006). The pilot episode was screened outdoors on a "giant
billboard style screen" in Conference Square, next to the Edinburgh
International Conference Centre.[37]

## [edit] DVD release

On June 27, 2007, the day before the airing of the show's final episode,
Warner Home Video announced an October 16 release date for the Studio 60 on
the Sunset Strip: Complete Series DVD set.[38]
