eMusic is an online music store that operates by subscription. It is
headquartered in New York City and owned by Dimensional Associates, LLC. As of
September 2008 eMusic has over 400,000 subscribers.

eMusic differs from other well-known subscription music services (such as
Napster and Rhapsody) in that the files available for download are in the MP3
format, making them fully compatible with all digital music players, and free
from digital rights management software restrictions such as expiration dates,
or copying or CD burning limitations.

While lauded by the general public, the lack of digital rights management
(DRM) encoding and low price model have made the service unappealing to the
Big Four record labels, leading it to specialize in underground artists and
non-mainstream music genres, including indie rock, pop, jazz, electronica, new
age, underground rap, traditional music, classical music, hardcore punk, and
experimental music, all on independent labels.

## [edit] Files

Due to the contentious nature of DRM encoding utilized by competing download
services, eMusic has won praise for not including any in their own files,
despite the fact that it has cost them contracts with the major record labels.
They have openly stated that this is a business move that has greatly aided
the site's popularity.[1] As Apple does not currently license FairPlay â the
DRM format compatible with their popular iPod player, used in files downloaded
from their iTunes Music Store â doing away with such protections is the only
means for a competing company to offer iPod-compatible downloads.[2] EMusic
stores a record of user purchases on its internal servers, but does not place
any purchaser information inside the tracks that are sold.[citation needed]

The record labels working with eMusic don't worry about file sharing of their
music because eMusic users tend to be older, and less likely to engage in file
sharing.[3][4] The type of college students who tend to participate in file-
sharing either couldn't or wouldn't pay for music online, so eMusic is more
targeted at avid music fans.[4] Gene Rumsey, general manager of Concord Music
Group, says eMusic fans are not the typical college-age file sharers. They are
more rabid fans who he believes are less likely to engage in online song
swapping.[3] Serious music fans would also appreciate that musicians are
actually paid for every download.[4]

The eMusic service uses the LAME mp3 encoder to produce variable bit rate MP3
files. Analysis on the files show that the preset used is alt-preset-standard,
a high quality VBR preset aiming at an average bit rate around 192kbit/s. [5]

## [edit] Status

EMusic caters to an older audience with the average subscriber being 39 who
subscribes for at least a year.[1] EMusic had 4,500,000 tracks available for
download [6] and sold over 250,000,000 tracks as of November 2008.[7] New
subscribers receive 25 free downloads during their first month of
subscription.[8] The trial account turns into a billable subscription account
immediately after registering for a trial. Refunds are possible under certain
circumstances by contacting eMusic customer support. Subscriptions allow users
to download a number of tracks per 30-day period. As of September 2008 a basic
package allows for 30 downloads, with Plus, Premium and Connoisseur
subscriptions offering more downloads per month at higher prices and lower
price per download. Every 30 days the download limit is reset (regardless of
how many songs were downloaded). EMusic also offers "booster packs" to
subscribers, which expire after 90 days rather than after a month, and are
consumed when subscribers download tracks beyond their monthly allotments.
Earlier business models supported an "all-you-can-eat" downloading pattern.
For a monthly fee, customers were able to download as many tracks as they
wished from the service. As the old emusic messageboard once
documented[citation needed], eMusic regularly disciplined customers â
including canceling their contracts â who downloaded more tracks than eMusic
thought reasonable within the "all-you-can-eat" framework.

There have been a number of complaints at various places on the web about
EMusic's service. These complaints range from claims that they still charge
customers after they have deleted their accounts to claims that the terms of
EMusic's terms of service obligate customers to subscribe for a year.[9]

Another complaint that has become more common is that emusic, by virtue of
their privacy policy [10] may pass subscriber information on to other
companies or individuals, who in turn send spam e-mails to the particular
emusic customer.

## [edit] Selection

Most of eMusic's contracts are with independent labels, giving the service a
reputation for primarily offering indie rock, indie pop, punk rock, jazz and
classical music. EMusic highlights its offerings through a host of exclusive
editorial content, along the lines of monthly "editor's picks", columns and
guides. The company also cites statistics from the American Association of
Independent Music that independents' market share of CD sales is 28%.[3]

With the "big four" record labels (Sony BMG, Universal Music Group, EMI and
Warner Music Group) unwilling to do business with the site[3], many popular
artists are either unrepresented or have very few releases available. This is
more of a problem in the genres of Top 40 rock and rap music, and less so in
genres such as jazz, where major artists spread their output across multiple,
smaller labels. This allows the site to feature some acclaimed recordings by
artists such as Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, and John
Coltrane. The site also carries the complete classical catalog of Naxos
Records.[11]

The site's alternative (or "indie") rock selection has also been aided by the
rise in widely-distributed but privately owned "minor" labels, such as Kill
Rock Stars and Matador Records, who have a fair amount of big-name talent on
their rolls (e.g. Cat Power, The Decemberists, Interpol and Sleater-Kinney,
who have been among eMusic's top-sellers). Music from other popular indie
labels includes Merge Records (Spoon, Arcade Fire, Lambchop), K Records
(Modest Mouse, Built to Spill), Touch and Go Records (Mekons, Girls Against
Boys), and TVT Records (Lil Jon, Ying Yang Twins, Guided By Voices).

In 1999, eMusic made headlines by releasing one of the first internet-only
albums by a major artist: Long Tall Weekend by They Might Be Giants.[12] The
band would also go on to release a series of monthly, exclusive rarities
collections (known as "TMBG Unlimited") through the service in 2001 and
2002.[4] John Flansburgh said that "Getting a half dozen or dozen unreleased
songs out each month provides an âultimate fan clubâ experience."[4]

In 2004, with the change from an unlimited download subscription model to a
set-track subscription download, eMusic significantly increased their
catalogue content over the next few years, particularly in the Indian
Soundtrack and Indian Classical genres and in the Classical music genre adding
labels like Saregama, Naxos, BIS, Chandos, Harmonia Mundi, Telarc and many
others.

In June 2006, eMusic added new music from V2 Records in the U.S. The label is
one of eMusic's highest-profile additions thus far, with multiplatinum acts
Moby and The White Stripes, along with critical favorites such as
Grandaddy.[13] However, this music is not available to eMusic users in many
other countries. [While Moby is still available at present, the White Stripes
catalog has long since been removed from the emusic site in North America.]

On August 10, 2006, eMusic added two European versions of its online store:
'eMusic UK' and 'eMusic Europe'. Current subscribers to the global site that
were within the European Union had their membership transferred to the
appropriate European store. EMusic UK and eMusic Europe have markedly inflated
prices compared to their North American counterpart, partially due to the
extra sales taxes which these stores are now subject to, which was
particularly noted by customers forced to transfer. However, the changeover
also included access to labels not available to non-European customers,
notably London-based Domino Records. The changeover also includes many works
previously unavailable to European customers, such as music from The White
Stripes and Mogwai. However, some artists previously available, such as Vienna
Teng, became unavailable to UK subscribers, even if they had purchased them
previously. It is also notable that the European version of the store is for
customers within the European Union, not customers within Europe.

In June 2007, eMusic added perhaps its biggest star yet to its lineup: Paul
McCartney of The Beatles. His album, Memory Almost Full, is also the first
release on Starbucks' Hear Music label.

The eMusicLive Venue Network is 22 independent clubs in the US where live
shows are recorded and offered to eMusic subscribers. Numerous shows are
recorded every week. In addition to subscription sales, recorded CDs are
offered for sale at the venue immediately after the event. EMusic plans to
establish kiosks where the music can be delivered directly to MP3 players or
flash drives. [14]

Beginning September 18, 2007, eMusic began offering audiobooks in MP3 format.
[15]

On April 2, 2008, eMusic added The Rolling Stones when they were on their
ABKCO label. This includes their music from 1964-1970, plus any compilations
made thereafter by ABKCO. The availability of The Rolling Stones' catalog
ended on May 3, 2008.

## [edit] Incarnations and ownership

The original eMusic was started in March 1995 by Mark Chasan[16] as the fourth
online CD retailer. EMusic and Nordic Music (owned by Kent Kiefer) formed a
joint venture in February 1998 to become the first digital media retailer and
sold the first MP3 players on the internet. EMusic, then headed by Chasan and
Kiefer, purchased Guy Giuliano's internet radio service GBS Radio Networks.
The new consortium launched the first online radio network LoudRadio, to
broadcast over a terrestrial radio station via KLOD-FM in Flagstaff, Arizona.

The company now known as eMusic was founded by Gene Hoffman and Bob Kohn on
January 8, 1998 and originally named GoodNoise Corporation. In October 1998,
GoodNoise acquired eMusic.com[17] along with on-line music pioneer Internet
Underground Music Archive (IUMA). In November 1999, eMusic acquired main rival
Cductive[18] and in December 1999 acquired Tunes.com, which operated
Rollingstone.com and DownBeatJazz.com. Then in 2001, the major label Universal
Music (then a division of Vivendi Universal) bought eMusic.com for USD 24.6
million.[19]

In November 2003, the service was purchased from VU Net USA by a New York-
based private equity arm of JDS Capital Management, Inc.[20] Following a
contentious period during which information disseminated by the company was
limited[citation needed], it was relaunched in 2004. Relaunch was soon
followed by a new format for the eMusic site, significant increase in both
editorial and music content and an eventual price increase for most
subscription levels.
