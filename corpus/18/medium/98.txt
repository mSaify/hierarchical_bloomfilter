## [edit] History

### [edit] Nissan Skyline GT-R

See also: Nissan Skyline GT-R

Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high
performance version of its Skyline range called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This
car proved to be iconic for Nissan[6][7] and achieved much fame and success on
road and track. The Nissan GT-R, although no longer carrying the "Skyline"
badge, has heritage in the Nissan Skyline GT-R. Like the Skyline GT-Rs R32
through R34, the Nissan GT-R is all-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6 cylinder
engine; however, the evolutionary, incremental changes between Skyline models
R32 through R34 have been done away with. The four-wheel-steering HICAS system
has been removed, and the traditional straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been
replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT.[8] Because of the GT-R's heritage, the
chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35,[9] or 'R35' for
short, carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations.
The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname
Godzilla.[10][11]

### [edit] Concepts

<IMG>

<IMG>

GT-R Proto at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show

Two concept vehicles were displayed at motor shows prior to the unveiling of
the production model. The first concept was shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in
2001 to preview what a 21st century GT-R would look like.[12] At the 2005
Tokyo Motor Show, Nissan unveiled a redesigned concept, the GT-R Proto,
stating that the production GT-R would be 80-90% based on this concept.[13]

## [edit] Production

### [edit] Base model

The production version of the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show,
launching in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007. The U.S. official launch
was 7 months later on July 07, 2008. Universal Nissan in Los Angeles provided
a customer with the delivery of a new GT-R, fresh from the production line at
12:01 AM, on July 7, 2008. The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe
became the third consumer market, where it launched late in the year. The
large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to
Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.
Also the engine and rear-mounted dual-clutch gearbox are built by hand, thus
limiting production to around 1000 cars a month.[14]

#### [edit] Specifications

<IMG>

<IMG>

The VR38DETT engine

The Nissan GT-R is powered by the VR38DETT engine, a 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu
in) DOHC V6. Two parallel Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI)
turbochargers provide forced induction.[15] Production vehicles produce a
manufacturer-claimed engine output of 480 bhp (360 kW) at 6400 rpm and 434
lbÂ·ft (588 NÂ·m) at 3200-5200 rpm.[16] According to independent dynamometer
tests, the GT-R produces 416 hp (310 kW) to 475 hp (354 kW) and 414 lbÂ·ft
(561 NÂ·m) to 457 lbÂ·ft (620 NÂ·m) at the wheels.[17][18] The engine also
meets California Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) standards.[19] A curb
weight of 1,730 kg (3,800 lb) or 1,736 kg (3,830 lb) with side curtain airbags
is achieved using a jig welded steel chassis with aluminum used for the hood,
trunk, and doors.[20] A rear mounted 6 speed dual clutch semi-automatic
transmission is used in conjunction with the ATTESA E-TS system to provide
power to all four wheels and along with Nissan's Vehicle Dynamics Control
(VDC-R) aids in handling and stability. Three shift modes can also be selected
for various conditions. The drag coefficient is 0.27.[21]

Cutaway model showing rear mounted transmission

Nissan claims the GT-R can reach a top speed of 192 mph (309 km/h),[23] Motor
Trend recorded a top speed of 195.0 mph (313.8 km/h).[24] It has been tested
to achieve 0-60 mph (97 km/h) times as low as 3.2 seconds with launch
control[25] and 3.9 seconds without[26] (improved to 3.5 seconds in models
produced since March 2009[27]). Edmunds.com achieved a standing quarter-mile
time of 11.6 s at 190 km/h (120 mph) using the GT-R's launch control
system.[28] Car and Driver achieved a standing quarter-mile time of 11.5 s at
200 km/h (120 mph).[29] Evo magazine achieved a 0-100-0 mph time of 13.9
seconds.[30] Autocar achieved a 0-100 mph (160 km/h) time of 8.5 seconds.[31]

With a manufacturer claimed lap time of 7:29 min on standard Japanese market
tires, the GT-R is currently one of the fastest production cars to lap the
NÃ¼rburgring circuit,[32][33] although Porsche accused Nissan of falsifying
those claims in September 2008.[34][35] Porsche claims to have conducted their
own test of the GT-R using no modifications and stock tires and achieved a
best time of 7:54. Nissan officially disputed Porsche's claim in October
2008.[36][37] Independent testing has provided times of around 7:50 - 7:55 for
the Nissan GT-R and 7:49 for the Porsche GT2[38][39] on the NÃ¼rburgring,
though both tests were conducted with the track partially damp and with the
use of automotive journalists as opposed to professional drivers.[39]

The GT-R currently holds a lap time of 1:19.7 around the Top Gear Test Track,
equalling that of the Ferrari 430 Scuderia.[40] Road & Track were able to
achieve quick lap times with the car on Buttonwillow Raceway, clocking in
approximately 5 seconds faster than the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and Porsche 911
Turbo.[41] On Willow Springs International Motorsports Park, Edmunds were able
to achieve lap times that were approximately 1 second slower than a Chevrolet
Corvette ZR1 with the GT-R.[42] On the Las Vegas Motor Speedway infield road
course, Motor Trend were able to achieve lap times with the GT-R that were
approximately equivalent to the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano and Porsche 911 GT2
and 3 seconds slower than a Chevrolet Corvette ZR1.[43]

Several automotive journalists, including Chris Harris of Autocar,[44] Jethro
Bovingdon of Evo,[45] and Jason Barlow of Top Gear (magazine)[46] have
compared the GT-R to the Bugatti Veyron. Harris and Bovingdon both labeled the
GT-R a "baby Veyron" in their respective comparison tests of the car.[44][45]

#### [edit] Design

<IMG>

<IMG>

The customizable multifunction display integrated into the dash of the GT-R

Nissan chief creative officer, ShirÅ Nakamura, has likened the new GT-R to
the eponymous giant robots of the Gundam series. Nakamura states: "The GT-R is
unique because it is not simply a copy of a European-designed supercar, it had
to really reflect Japanese culture."

Nakamura noted that the GT-R's square lines and vents were influenced by
Gundam robots. Nissan's American designers sculpted the rear three quarters of
the vehicle, while their European designers sculpted the roofline.[47]

Polyphony Digital, creators of the Gran Turismo series of racing video games,
were themselves involved in the development of the GT-R, having been
contracted to design the GT-R's multifunction display.[48]

### [edit] SpecV

Nissan introduced the GT-R SpecV on January 7, 2009 at the 2009 Tokyo Auto
Salon.[49] Exterior changes from the base GT-R consist of a carbon fiber rear
spoiler, grille, and brake ducts, along with an exclusive Ultimate Black Opal
paint job. Interior changes include a set of carbon fiber Recaro front seats
with the rear seats being completely removed. Carbon fiber covers the center
storage box, instrument panel, and replaces the majority of the interior trim.

The GT-R SpecV is powered by the standard twin-turbo 3,799 cc (3.8 L; 231.8 cu
in) V6 with no increase in (peak) horsepower, but a new high gear boost
controller that temporarily increases boost pressure should deliver more
torque in mid to high-range revs. Other mechanical changes include a titanium
exhaust, reworked suspension, carbon ceramic brakes, and 20-inch (510 mm)
NISMO wheels. Overall weight is decreased by 132 lb (60 kg) over the standard
GT-R.[50]

Japan sales begin on February 2, 2009 at seven pre-selected dealers who are
staffed by mechanics with special GT-R SpecV training and are knowledgeable of
racing circuit driving. Pricing is set at Â¥15,750,000 (over US$160,000).
Nissan has not announced any plans to sell the SpecV outside of Japan.

### [edit] Super GT

Nismo GT-R for 2008 season of Super GT

Nismo, the motorsport arm of Nissan will be entering the Nissan GT-R in the
Super GT race series in the GT500 class for the 2008 season, replacing the
Nissan 350Z.[51]

Unlike the production car, the GT500 version has a completely different
drivetrain. The race car has a 4.5 litre naturally-aspirated V8 with 6 speed
sequential manual gearbox and a RWD layout from its predecessor, the 350Z race
car.[52]

A prototype was spotted testing around the Suzuka Circuit as well as Fuji
Speedway in Japan.[53][54] The car itself went on to win the opening race of
the 2008 Super GT season at Suzuka scoring a one-two finish for Nissan.[55]
The dominant performances in the opening race has led to all GT-Rs being
applied a 50 kg weight penalty in addition to the race weight penalty under
the Special Adjustment of Performance under the Super GT regulations.[56] In
race two, the GT-R repeated their 1-2 result in Suzuka despite the race
winning car of team Nismo carrying a 100 kg weight penalty making it only the
3rd team in JGTC/Super GT history to do so. The last time this feat was
achieved was 10 years ago by Nismo Skyline GT-R racing under the same number
23.[57] Despite the weight handicap, it did in fact become the champion in
this 2008 season through the Xanavi Nismo GT-R driven by Satoshi Motoyama and
Benoit Treluyer, as well as winning 7 out of 9 races driven by 4 different
teams using GT-Rs.

### [edit] FIA GT

On 27 February 2009, Nismo announced a partnership with British racing team
Gigawave Motorsports to enter a GT-R in four races in the 2009 FIA GT
Championship season. The entry will not be competing for championship points,
but will be used by Nismo to refine the performance of the GT-R for future
customer teams in the GT1 category. Nismo driver Michael Krumm and Gigawave
driver Darren Turner will co-drive the GT1 GT-R.[58]

### [edit] Other categories

A production-based Nissan GT-R made its world motorsport debut in Australia's
Targa Tasmania tarmac rally in April 2008,[59] however it sustained damage
early in the event and did not complete the rally.[60] The Nissan GT-R did win
the Competition Modern class in the 2008 Targa West.[61] The Nissan GT-R is
also the official safety car of Japan's SuperGT 2008 series. The Nissan GT-R
is the new official safety car of the V8 Supercars in Australia.[62]

## [edit] Aftermarket tuning

Despite early concerns about the difficulty of modification of the Nissan
GT-R, a number of modifications have been released. The previously reported
"untuneable" ECU has since been hacked by several tuning houses.

MINE'S has decoded its ECU, and others (MCR,[63] HKS, and Top Secret) have
bypassed the unit. They have been seen testing modified GT-Rs with the former
two having conducted tests at the Tsukuba Circuit.[64][65]

In a review by Motor Trend editor Scott Kanemura, it was revealed that the GPS
system fitted to the GT-R would remove the 180-kilometer per hour (112 mph)
speed limiter when the car arrives at a race track, but only on tracks
approved by Nissan. Aftermarket ECUs have been developed to bypass the speed
limiter, in addition to stand-alone speed-limiter defeaters. However, Nissan
confirmed that the GPS check will not be implemented in American models.[66]

In August 2008, Nissan's official motorsport and tuning arm Nismo announced
the "Club Sport" tuning package for the GT-R . The package, which will also be
fitted to the upcoming V-Spec GT-R,[67] includes Bilstein Damptronic
compatible dampers, 20" forged aluminum wheels from Rays Engineering,
Bridgestone run-flat tires, Recaro carbon fiber-shelled bucket seats, a
titanium exhaust, and a revised rear diffuser with an added cooling duct.[68]
The package is supported by a warranty and saves over 20 kg of mass.

Hennessey Performance Engineering has recently released two packages for the
GT-R, called the GODZILLA 600 & GODZILLA 700. The upgrades push the GT-R's
maximum output to 600 and 700 horsepower (520 kW), respectively.[69]
