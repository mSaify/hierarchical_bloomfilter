Tekkon Kinkreet (éã³ã³ç­ã¯ãªã¼ã ,Tekkon KinkurÄ«to?, a pun on
"Tekkin Concrete", the Japanese term for reinforced concrete) (also known as
Tekkonkinkreet in English release)[1] is a 2006 feature-length Japanese anime
film, directed by Michael Arias and animated by Studio 4Â°C, adapted from
Black and White, a three-volume seinen manga series by TaiyÅ Matsumoto, which
was originally serialized between 1993 and 1994 in Shogakukan's Big Comic
Spirits.[2][3] It was first released in Japan on December 23, 2006.[4] The
story takes place in the fictional Treasure Town and centers on a pair of
orphaned street kids: the tough, canny Black and the childish, innocent White,
together known as the Cats, as they deal with yakuza attempting to take over
Takara Machi.
