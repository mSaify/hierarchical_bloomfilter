## [edit] Operations and history

Alexa Internet was founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat[2] in
an effort to solve the internet search problem by tracking user decisions and
using that data to aid future searches. From the company's early website in
1999:[3]

> Alexa Internet was created from a novel vision. A vision of navigation that
learns and improves over time with the collective participation of its users.
We all experience the gaps in navigating and finding information on the
Internet as it is used today--frustrating keyword searches that turn up
hundreds or thousands of web pages and sites, very few of which are of any
interest. What if we, as a community of users, could effortlessly pool our
collective experience and add human intelligence to navigation? What if we
could fill in those gaps? It is a radical concept and it is our goal to make
it real, and we invite you to join us in this effort. What we are doing can
change the way we use the Internet forever. The Alexa service is the first
Internet software product that learns from people. This intelligent navigation
service provides a continuous source of relevant recommendations of where to
go next on the Web.

The company's name was chosen in homage to the Library of Alexandria,[4]
drawing a parallel between the largest repository of knowledge in the ancient
world to the potential for the internet if the search problem could be solved.
The company offered a toolbar that gave Internet users guidance on where to go
next, based on the traffic patterns of its user community. Alexa also offered
context for each site visited: to whom it was registered, how many pages it
had, how many other sites pointed to it, and how frequently it was updated.[5]
The company's premises are in Building 37 of the Presidio of San Francisco.

The race to solve the internet search problem was decisively won by Google
with their much simpler backrub approach[clarification needed]. But Alexa
still had a lot to offer. Their approach to intelligent navigation included
the archiving of webpages as they were crawled. This database served as the
basis for the creation of the Internet Archive (also located in the Presidio)
and its Wayback Machine.[6] Alexa continues to supply the Internet Archive
with web crawls.

In 1999, Alexa was acquired by Amazon.com for about $250 million in Amazon
stock[7] as the company transitioned away from its original vision of
providing an intelligent search solution. Alexa began a partnership with
Google in spring 2002, and with the Open Directory Project in January 2003.[1]
Live Search replaced Google as a provider of search results in May 2006.[8] In
September 2006, they began using their own Search Platform[clarification
needed] to serve results. In December 2006, they released Alexa Image Search.
Built in-house, it is the first major application to be built on their Web
Platform.

Alexa also provides "site info"[clarification needed] for the A9.com search
engine.

In December 2005, Alexa opened its extensive search index and web-crawling
facilities to third party programs through a comprehensive set of web services
and APIs. These could be used, for instance, to construct vertical search
engines that could run on Alexa's own servers or elsewhere. Uniquely, their
Web Search Platform gives developers access to their raw crawl data. In May
2007, Alexa changed their API to require comparisons be limited to 3 sites,
reduced size embedded graphs be shown using Flash, and mandatory embedded
BritePic ads.[9]

In April 2007, the lawsuit Alexa v. Hornbaker was filed to stop trademark
infringement by the statsaholic service.[10] In the lawsuit, Alexa alleges
that Hornbaker is stealing traffic graphs for profit, and that the primary
purpose of his site is to display graphs that are generated by Alexa's
servers.[11][12] Hornbaker removed the term Alexa from his service name on
March 19, 2007.[13] Nevertheless, Alexa expressly grants permission to refer
its data in third-party work subject to suitable credits.[14]

On November 27, 2008, Amazon announced that Alexa Web Search was no longer
accepting new customers, and the service would be deprecated or discontinued
for existing customers on January 26, 2009. [15]

## [edit] Accuracy of ranking by the Alexa Toolbar

Main article: Alexa toolbar

Alexa ranks sites based on tracking information of users of its Alexa Toolbar
for Internet Explorer and from integrated sidebars in Mozilla and Netscape.

There is some controversy over how representative Alexa's user base is of
typical Internet behavior. If Alexa's user base is a fair statistical sample
of the Internet user population (e.g., a random sample of sufficient size),
Alexa's ranking should be quite accurate. In reality, not much is known about
the sample and possible sampling biases. Alexa itself notes several
examples.[16][17] A known source of bias is the self-selecting, opt-in nature
of Alexa traffic tracking software installation, but the significance of this
bias on rankings is not reported.[clarification needed][18]

On April 16, 2008 many users reported dramatic shifts in their Alexa rankings.
Alexa confirmed this later in the day with an announcement that they had
released the "New Alexa Ranking System" claiming that they now take into
account more data sources "beyond Alexa Toolbar users".[19]

## [edit] Spyware

The Alexa toolbar is regarded by many vendors, such as Symantec and McAfee, as
spyware. Symantec classifies the toolbar as Trackware.[20] McAfee classifies
it as Adware, a "Potentially Unwanted Program."[21] McAfee Site Advisor rates
the Alexa website as yellow, with the warning, "In our tests, we found
downloads on this site that some people consider adware, spyware or other
potentially unwanted programs,".[22]
