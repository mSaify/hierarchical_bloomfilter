Ubuntu, (pronounced [Ã¹bÃºntÃº], or "Ooh-boon-too"[citation needed]), is a
computer operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux. Ubuntu's goals include
providing an up-to-date, stable operating system for the average user, with a
strong focus on usability and ease of installation. Ubuntu has been rated as
the most popular Linux distribution for the desktop, claiming approximately
30% of desktop Linux installations in 2007.[2]

Ubuntu is composed of free and open source software distributed under various
licenses, especially the GNU General Public License (GPL) so that users are
free to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Ubuntu
is sponsored by the British based company Canonical Ltd., owned by South
African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth. Instead of selling Ubuntu for profit,
Canonical creates revenue by selling technical support. By keeping Ubuntu free
software and open source, Canonical is able to take advantage of the talents
of outside developers in Ubuntu's constituent components without developing
the entire operating system itself (which is based primarily on current Linux
kernels).

Canonical endorses and provides support for four additional Ubuntu-like
operating systems: Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, (a subproject and add-on for
Ubuntu, designed for school environments and home users),[3] and Ubuntu JeOS
(pronounced "Juice", a stripped-down version of Ubuntu optimized for virtual
appliances).[4]

Canonical releases new versions of Ubuntu every six months and supports Ubuntu
for eighteen months by submitting security fixes, patches to critical bugs and
including minor updates to programs. LTS (Long Term Support) releases, which
occur every two years,[5] are supported for three years on the desktop and
five years for servers.[6] The current version of Ubuntu, Intrepid Ibex, was
released on October 30, 2008, and the upcoming version, Jaunty Jackalope, will
be released on April 23, 2009. The version after Jaunty will be Karmic Koala,
which will possess several advanced features like Eucalyptus.

## [edit] History and development process

Ubuntu was initially forked from the Debian project's code base.[7] The aim
was to release a new version of Ubuntu every six months, resulting in a more
frequently updated system. Ubuntu's first release was on October 20, 2004.[8]
The name Ubuntu, pronounced IPA: [uËËbuËntuË] in English[9], comes from
the Zulu word "ubuntu" ([Ã¹ÉÃºntÃº]), translated as "humanity to others",
describing the ubuntu philosophy: "I am what I am because of who we all are",
a positive aspect of community.

New releases of Ubuntu coincide a month after GNOME releases.[10] In contrast
to previous general-purpose forks of Debian â such as MEPIS, Xandros,
Linspire, Progeny and Libranet, many of which relied on proprietary and closed
source add-ons as part of their business model â Ubuntu has stayed closer to
Debian's philosophy and uses free (libre) software, making an exception only
for some proprietary hardware drivers.[11]

Ubuntu packages are based on packages from Debian's unstable branch: both
distributions use Debian's deb package format and package management tools,
APT and Synaptic, although Debian and Ubuntu packages are not necessarily
binary compatible with each other, and may need to be rebuilt from source.[12]
Ubuntu cooperates with Debian â to some extent pushing changes back to
Debian,[13] although there has been criticism that this doesn't happen often
enough.[14] Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within
Debian. However, Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, expressed concern about
Ubuntu packages diverging too far from Debian Sarge to remain compatible.[14]

Before release, packages are imported from Debian Unstable continuously and
merged with Ubuntu-specific modifications. A month before release, imports are
frozen, and soon after a feature freeze is instated, which allows for
packagers to work on ensuring that the current software works well, rather
than supporting the moving target that is Unstable.

Ubuntu is currently funded by Canonical Ltd. On July 8, 2005, Mark
Shuttleworth and Canonical Ltd announced the creation of the Ubuntu Foundation
and provided an initial funding of US$10 million. The purpose of the
foundation is to ensure the support and development for all future versions of
Ubuntu. Mark Shuttleworth describes the foundation as an emergency fund in
case Canonical's involvement ends.[15]

The Ubuntu logo and typography has remained the same since that first release.
The hand-drawn,[16] lowercase OpenType font used is called Ubuntu-Title and
was created by Andy Fitzsimon.[17] The font is distributed under the terms of
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and use with logos derived from
the Ubuntu logo is encouraged.[17] The font is available as a package for
Ubuntu.[17]

Ubuntu 8.04, released on April 24, 2008, is the current Long Term Support
(LTS) release. Canonical has released previous LTS versions every two years,
and has committed to releasing the next LTS version in 2010, two years after
8.04.[18][19][20] Meanwhile, the current standard-support period release,
Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex), was released on October 30, 2008.

On March 12, 2009, Ubuntu announced full developer support on 3rd party cloud
management platforms to deploy and manage cloud applications on cloud
infrastructures such as Amazon EC2.[21]

Installing and removing software in Ubuntu

Ubuntu focuses on usability,[22] including the widespread use of the sudo tool
for administrative tasks.[23][24] The Ubiquity installer allows installing
Ubuntu to the hard disk from within the Live CD environment without the need
for restarting the computer prior to installation. Ubuntu also emphasizes
accessibility and internationalization, to reach as many people as possible.
Beginning with 5.04, UTF-8 became the default character encoding,[25] which
allows for support of a variety of non-Roman scripts. The default appearance
of the user interface in the current version is called Human and is
characterized by shades of brown and orange.

The most recent version of Ubuntu comes installed with a wide range of
software including OpenOffice, Firefox, Pidgin, Transmission, and GIMP.
Several lightweight card, puzzle, and board games are pre-installed, such as
Sudoku and chess. Ubuntu has all networking ports closed by default for added
security; its firewall offers fine-grained control of incoming and outgoing
connections. GNOME 2.22âthe default desktop environment of Ubuntu
8.04âoffers support for 46 languages.[26] There are several ways to install
Ubuntu, outlined below.[27]

### [edit] Installation

Installation of Ubuntu is generally performed with the Live CD. By booting it,
a user can first choose to "test-drive" the Ubuntu OS (albeit with a
performance loss due to loading applications from a CD), providing the
opportunity to test hardware compatibility and driver support. The CD also
contains the Ubiquity installer,[28] which guides the user through the
permanent installation process. CD images of all current and past versions are
available for download at the Ubuntu web site. Installing from the CD requires
a minimum of 256 MB RAM. Users can download a disk image of the CD which can
then be written to a physical medium, or run from a hard drive via UNetbootin.

Canonical offers Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu installation CDs at no cost,
including paid postage for destinations in most countries around the world,
via a service called ShipIt. After a request for CDs is made and approved,
disks are sent via post. Delivery is estimated at six to ten weeks.

A Microsoft Windows migration tool, called Migration Assistant, was introduced
in April 2007 (with Ubuntu 7.04).[29] It imports Windows users' bookmarks,
desktop background (wallpaper), and various settings for immediate use in the
Ubuntu installation.[30]

Ubuntu and Kubuntu can be booted and run from a USB Flash drive (as long as
the BIOS supports booting from USB), with the option of saving settings to the
flashdrive. This allows a portable installation that can be run on any PC
which is capable of booting from a USB drive.[31] In newer versions of Ubuntu,
the USB creator program is available to install Ubuntu on a USB drive (with or
without a LiveCD disc).

Wubi, which is included on the Live CD, allows the distribution to be
installed on a virtual Windows loop device. This requires no partitioning of a
user's hard drive, allowing the installation of Ubuntu to a file on a Windows
drive. This also allows the user to manage Ubuntu as a Windows program,
configuring and uninstalling Wubi as another program via the Control Panel
(Windows). Wubi also makes use of the Migration Assistant to import users'
settings. Initially developed as an independent project for versions 7.04 and
7.10, Wubi was later merged with Ubuntu and is included on Ubuntu Live CD as
of the 8.04 release.[32]

### [edit] Remastering

See also: List of remastering software

Various programs exist to produce customised remasters of the Ubuntu Live CD,
which some refer to as a "Custom Spin"[33], such as remastersys and
Reconstructor.

## [edit] Package classification and support

Ubuntu divides all software into four domains to reflect differences in
licensing and the degree of support available.[34] All unsupported
applications receive updates from community members, but not from Canonical.
They are as follows:

free software non-free software  
supported Main Restricted  
unsupported Universe Multiverse  
Free software here includes only software that meets the Ubuntu licensing
requirements,[35] which roughly correspond to the Debian Free Software
Guidelines. There is one exception for the Main category, however â it
contains firmware and fonts which are not allowed to be modified, but are
included because their distribution is otherwise unencumbered.[36]

Non-free software is usually unsupported (Multiverse), but some exceptions
(Restricted) are made for very important non-free software. Supported non-free
software includes device drivers that can be used to run Ubuntu on some
current hardware, such as binary-only graphics card drivers. The level of
support in the Restricted category is more limited than that of Main, since
the developers may not have access to the source code. It is intended that
Main and Restricted should contain all software needed for a general-use Linux
system. Alternative programs for the same tasks and programs for specialized
applications are placed in the Universe and Multiverse categories.

In addition to the above, in which the software does not receive new features
after an initial release, Ubuntu Backports is an officially recognized project
to backport newer software from later versions of Ubuntu.[37] The repository
is not comprehensive; it consists primarily of user-requested packages, which
are approved if they meet quality guidelines. Backports receives no support at
all from Canonical, and is entirely community-maintained.

The -updates repository provides updates to stable releases of Ubuntu and are
generally installed through update-manager. Each release is given its own
-updates repository (ie. intrepid-updates). The repository is supported by
Canonical for packages in main and restricted, and the community for packages
in universe and multiverse. All updates to the repository must meet certain
requirements and go through the -proposed repository before being made
available to the public.[38] Updates will continue to be available until the
end of life for the release.

In addition to the -updates repository, the unstable -proposed repository
contains uploads which must be confirmed before being copied into -updates.
All updates must go through this process to ensure that the patch does truly
fix the bug and there is no risk of regression.[39] Updates in -proposed are
confirmed by either Canonical or members of the community.

### [edit] Availability of third-party software

See also: Linux distribution#Proprietary software, Medibuntu, Getdeb, and
Ubuntu extras remix

Ubuntu has a certification system for third party software.[40] Some third-
party software that does not limit distribution is included in Ubuntu's
multiverse component. The package ubuntu-restricted-extras additionally
contains software that may be legally restricted, including support for MP3
and DVD playback, Microsoft TrueType core fonts, Sun's Java runtime
environment, Adobe's Flash Player plugin, many common audio/video codecs, and
unrar, an unarchiver for files compressed in the RAR file format.

Additionally, several third party application suites are available for
purchase through the Canonical web-based store, including software for DVD
playback and media codecs.

## [edit] Releases

Main article: List of Ubuntu releases

The Ubuntu project makes two releases per year, using the year and month of
the release as the version number. The first Ubuntu release, for example, was
Ubuntu 4.10 and was released on October 20, 2004.[41] Consequently, version
numbers for future versions are provisional; if the release is delayed until a
different month to that planned, the version number changes accordingly.

Ubuntu releases are also given code names, using an adjective and an animal
with the same first letter e.g: "Dapper Drake" and "Intrepid Ibex". With the
exception of the first two releases, code names are in alphabetical order,
allowing a quick determination of which release is newer. Commonly, Ubuntu
releases are referred to using only the adjective portion of the code
name.[42]

Releases are timed to be approximately one month after GNOME releases, which
are in turn about one month after releases of X.org. Consequently, every
Ubuntu release comes with a newer version of both GNOME and X. Release 6.06
(Dapper Drake)âand recently 8.04 (Hardy Heron)âhave been labeled as a Long
Term Support (LTS), to indicate support with updates for three years on the
desktop and five years on the server, with paid technical support available
from Canonical Ltd.[43] Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop was released in 2008. It includes
the latest enhancements and is maintained until 2010.

See also: List of Ubuntu-based distributions

Several official and unofficial Ubuntu variants exist. These Ubuntu variants
install a set of packages different from the original Ubuntu. Since they draw
additional packages and updates from the same repositories as Ubuntu, however,
the same software is available for each of them. Unofficial variants and
derivatives are not controlled or guided by Canonical and are generally forks
with customizations for specific goals. The "fully supported" Ubuntu
derivatives include:[66]

  * Kubuntu, a desktop distribution using KDE rather than GNOME
  * Edubuntu, a distribution designed for classrooms using GNOME
  * Ubuntu Server Edition
  * Xubuntu, a "lightweight" distribution based on the Xfce desktop environment instead of GNOME, designed to run better on low-specification computers

Other Ubuntu distributions developed or otherwise recognized by Canonical
include:[66]

  * Gobuntu, a distribution that includes only free software
  * Mythbuntu, a multimedia platform based on MythTV
  * Ubuntu JeOS (pronounced as "juice"), is described as "an efficient variant ... configured specifically for virtual appliances".[67]
  * Ubuntu MID Edition, an Ubuntu edition that targets Mobile Internet Devices.[68]
  * Ubuntu Netbook Remix,[69][70] designed for ultra-portables including the the ASUS Eee PC,[71] Dell Inspiron Mini Series[72], and the Acer Aspire One[73].
  * Ubuntu Studio, a multimedia-creation form of Ubuntu

Other related derivative distributions (not formally recognized by Canonical)
include:

  * OpenGEU (formerly Geubuntu) - a distro mixing the power of Enlightenment and usability of Gnome.
  * Easy Peasy (formerly Ubuntu Eee) - an operating system for netbooks based on Ubuntu
  * CrunchBang Linux \- a lightweight Ubuntu derivative suitable for low-end hardware with limited resources such as the ASUS Eee PC.
  * Super Ubuntu \- a remaster of Ubuntu with usability as the main focus
  * Linux Mint \- a distribution that includes desktop improvements and proprietary software/drivers, with a focus on making things work out of the box.
  * Portable Ubuntu for Windows \- makes it possible to run Ubuntu within Windows (as an application), uses CoLinux
  * Ubuntu CE \- Ubuntu Christian Edition is a free, open source operating system geared towards Christians.

## [edit] System requirements

The desktop version of Ubuntu currently supports the Intel x86 and the AMD64
architectures. Some server releases also support the SPARC
architecture[74][75] Unofficial support is available for the PowerPC,[76]
IA-64 (Itanium) and PlayStation 3 architectures.

The minimum system requirements for a desktop installation are a 300 MHz x86
processor, 256 MB of RAM, 4 GB of hard drive space,[77] and a video card which
supports VGA at 640x480 resolution. The recommended system requirements for
the desktop installation are a 700 MHz x86 processor, 384 MB of RAM, 8 GB of
hard drive space,[77] and a video card which supports VGA at 1024Ã768
resolution. The server installation requires a 300 MHz x86 processor, 64 MB of
RAM,[78] and a video card which supports VGA at 640Ã480. Computers that do
not meet the minimum recommended system requirements are suggested to try
Xubuntu, based on Xfce.[79]

## [edit] Reception

In an August 2007 survey of 38,500 visitors on DesktopLinux.com, Ubuntu was
the most popular distribution with 30.3% of respondents claiming to use it.[2]

In January 2009 the New York Times reported that Ubuntu now has over ten
million users.[81]

Ubuntu was awarded the Reader Award for best Linux distribution at the 2005
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in London,[82] has been favorably reviewed in
online and print publications,[83][84][85] and has won InfoWorld's 2007 Bossie
Award for Best Open Source Client OS.[86]

Jamie Hyneman, co-host of the television series Mythbusters has advocated
Linux (specifically giving the example of Ubuntu) as an alternative to
proprietary software, citing software bloat as a major hurdle in proprietary
operating systems.[87][88]

Ubuntu has also received negative assessments. Ars Technica reviewed the
initial release of Ubuntu 8.04 and concluded that while it was a clear
improvement over Ubuntu 7.10, some flaws significantly detracted from the
quality of the user experience.[89] Specifically, Ars Technica felt that
Transmission (a BitTorrent client) was too simple for BitTorrent power users,
that the default search system Tracker was inferior to Beagle and that the
PulseAudio configuration that shipped was buggy[89] (a view shared by
PulseAudio creator Lennart Poettering, who states, "Ubuntu didn't exactly do a
stellar job [adopting PulseAudio]. They didn't do their homework"[90]). PC
World criticized the lack of an integrated desktop effects manager, although
this did not prevent them from naming Ubuntu the "best all-around Linux
distribution available today".[91] ChannelWeb criticized the Wubi installer in
8.04, noting that it hung after the installation was complete.[92] ChannelWeb
also noted that while they were able to connect to Microsoft Active
Directories, the process was not seamless.[92] In their preview of Ubuntu 8.04
InfoWorld stated that they felt Brasero's CD/DVD burning was lacklustre as
compared to similar pay-to-use programs available for Windows or Mac OS X.[93]

The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Macedonia deployed
more than 180,000 Ubuntu Linux based classroom desktops,[when?] and has
obliged to stimulate every student in the Republic of Macedonia to use Ubuntu-
powered computer workstations.[94]

## [edit] Vendor support

A number of vendors offer computers with Ubuntu pre-installed. Dell,
Tesco,[95] and Gliese IT have provided this option since 2007, while System76
has done so since November 2005.[96] Dell and System76 customers are able to
choose between 30-day, three-month, and yearly Ubuntu support plans through
Canonical.[97] Dell offers Ubuntu-driven computers for sale in the United
States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Spain, and Latin America.[98]
In addition to the standard Ubuntu installation, select Dell machines running
Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 come with proprietary, legal DVD playback capabilities
using LinDVD.[99] Dell computers running Ubuntu 8.04 include extra support for
ATI Video Graphics, Dell Wireless, Fingerprint Readers, HDMI, Bluetooth and
MP3/WMA/WMV.[100]
