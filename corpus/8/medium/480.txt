Zhang Yimou (born November 14, 1951) is an internationally acclaimed Chinese
filmmaker and former cinematographer,[1] and one of the best known of the
Fifth Generation of Chinese film directors.[2] He made his directorial debut
in 1987 with the film Red Sorghum. One of Zhang's recurrent themes is a
celebration of the resilience, even the stubbornness, of Chinese people in the
face of hardships and adversities, a theme which has occurred from To Live
(1994) through to Not One Less (1999). His works are particularly noted for
their usage of colour, as can be seen in his early trilogy (like Raise the Red
Lantern) or in his wuxia films such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers.

## [edit] Early life

Zhang Yimou was born in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. As a child he suffered
prejudice and derision because of his family's association with the Kuomintang
(Nationalist party). His father had been a major under Chiang Kai-shek and an
elder brother had followed the Nationalist forces to Taiwan after their 1949
defeat in the civil war.

When the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966 he was forced to suspend studying
and worked, first as a farm hand, and then, for seven years, as a labourer in
a cotton textile mill, much like the one he portrayed in Ju Dou. During this
time he took up painting and amateur still photography. He had to sell his
blood for five months to get enough money to purchase his first camera when he
was 18.

## [edit] Early career

When the Beijing Film Academy opened in 1978, Zhang was already 27, over-aged
and without the prerequisite academic qualifications. He wrote a personal
appeal to the Ministry of Culture, citing "ten years lost during the Cultural
Revolution"[citation needed] and offered a portfolio of his personal
photographic works.[3] The authorities finally relented and admitted him into
the Department of Cinematography.[3]

As a result, Zhang graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1982 along with
compatriots Chen Kaige and Tian Zhuangzhuang (the latter two from the
Directing class). They are often referred to collectively as the Class of
1982.[citation needed] The students saw films by European, Japanese and
American art directors, as well as Chineseâfar more than any of their
predecessorsâincluding the works of Tarkovsky, Antonioni, Scorsese,
Truffaut, Fei Mu, Wu Yonggang, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Malick and Alain
Resnais.[citation needed]

As was the norm, Zhang and his co-graduates were assigned to small inland
studios, and as a cinematographer, he began working for the Guangxi Film
Studio.[3] Though penciled in to work as director's assistants, they soon
learned there was a dearth of directors (owing to the Cultural Revolution),
and appealed successfully to make their own films.[citation needed] Zhang's
first work, One and Eight (as director of photography), was made in 1984
together with director Zhang Junzhao. Zhang Yimou's input was telling: he shot
from obscure angles, and positioned actors and actresses at the side, rather
than center, to heighten dramatic effect, using a âunique and emphatic
visual style, based on the asymmetrical and unbalanced composition of the
shots and the shooting of color stock as though it were black and
white".[citation needed]

Zhang's next collaboration, under director and fellow graduate Chen Kaige was
to be one of the defining Chinese films of the 1980s: Yellow Earth (1984). The
film today is widely considered the inaugural film for the Chinese Fifth
Generation directors that were a part of an artistic reemergence in China
after the end of the Cultural Revolution.[4]

Along with his work in One and Eight, Zhang's contribution to Yellow Earth
signaled a cinematic departure from the propagandist films of the Cultural
Revolution.[5] Local critics immediately sat up and took notice of this new
cohort of daring artists who were defying conventions of Chinese
cinema.[citation needed]

Zhang continued to work with Chen for the latter's next film, The Big Parade
(1985). Their collaboration was one of the most fruitful of the Fifth
Generation period.[citation needed]

## [edit] Directorial period

### [edit] 1980s

In 1985, in appreciation of his talent, Fourth Generation director Wu Tianming
invited Zhang to Xi'an Film Studio for his upcoming project Old Well. Filming
of Old Well was completed in 1986, with Zhang as both cinematographer and
actor â a role that won him Best Actor at the Tokyo International Film
Festival.[citation needed] In return for his participation in Wu's project,
Zhang made Wu promise logistics support for his own first directorial effort,
a project that he had envisioned for some time.[citation needed]

In 1987 Zhang embarked on his directorial debut, Red Sorghum, starring Chinese
actress Gong Li, handpicked by Zhang, in her first leading role. Released to
widespread critical acclaim, Red Sorghum catapulted Zhang into the forefront
of the world's art directors, winning him the Golden Bear for Best Picture at
the 1988 Berlin Film Festival.[6] Its rich, earthy visual style of narrative
storytelling came to be the hallmark of Zhang's early films.[citation needed]

Codename Cougar (or The Puma Action), a minor experiment in the political
thriller genre, was released in 1989, featuring Gong Li and eminent Chinese
actor Ge You in major roles. However, it garnered less-than-positive reviews
at home and Zhang himself later dismissed the film as his worst.[7]

In the same year, Zhang began work on his next project, the period drama Ju
Dou. Starring Gong Li as the titular main character, along with Li Baotian in
the male leading role, Ju Dou was an early example of Zhang's unique use of
colors and lush cinematography and female-centered films.[citation needed] The
picture garnered as much critical acclaim in film circles as his Red Sorghum
and became China's first entry to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best
Foreign Language Film.[8]

### [edit] 1990s

Fresh after the success of Ju Dou, Zhang began work on what has been
considered by many as his magnum opus, Raise the Red Lantern.[citation needed]
Based on novelist Su Tong's book Wives and Concubines, the film depicted the
realities of life in a rich family compound during the 1920s. Gong Li was
again featured in the leading role, her fourth collaboration with director
Zhang. With a unique filmmaking style characterized by highly intense scenes
through controlled, formalized color photography, Raise the Red Lantern was
Zhang's most personal effort to this point.[citation needed]

The film was released in its home country in 1991 to immediate political
controversy, due to officials fearing that the story would be taken as an
allegory against Chinese communist authoritarianism.[citation needed] Although
the screenplay had been approved by censors prior to shooting, the film itself
was initially banned from theatrical release in China.[citation needed]

On the other hand, international reaction to Raise the Red Lantern was almost
unanimous acclaim. Film critics such as Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times
noted its "voluptuous physical beauty"[9] and sumptuous use of colors. Gong
Li's acting was also praised as starkly contrasting with the roles she played
in Zhang's earlier films. Raise the Red Lantern was nominated for the Best
Foreign Language Film category at the 1991 Academy Awards, being the second
Chinese film to earn this distinction (after Zhang's Ju Dou).[citation needed]
It eventually lost out to Gabriele Salvatores's Mediterraneo.

The Story of Qiu Ju (1992) marked a significant change in direction for Zhang.
Employing a far lighter tone and generous touches of everyday humor, Zhang
used non-professional actors together with his long-time collaborator Gong Li
to achieve a neorealist effect in telling a tale of Chinese peasantry waddling
through ineffective bureaucracy.[citation needed] It was also released to
critical praise, winning the Golden Lion for Best Picture at the 1992 Venice
International Film Festival.[10]

Subsequently, Zhang directed To Live, an epic film based on an acclaimed novel
by Yu Hua. To Live highlighted the resilience of the ordinary Chinese people,
personified by its two leads, amidst three generations of historical upheavals
throughout Chinese politics of the 20th century. The longest of his films to
date, it was released at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Jury
Prize (the second-highest accolade behind the prestigious Palme d'Or), as well
as a Best Actor prize for Ge You.[11]

Having received international recognition for his earlier works, Zhang
completed a major phase of his directorial work with the period gangster drama
Shanghai Triad.[citation needed] The film, which was released in 1995,
featured leading actress Gong Li in her seventh film under Zhang's direction.
The two had a romantic as well as professional relationship, but this would
end during production of Shanghai Triad.[12] Zhang and Gong would not work
together again until 2006's Curse of the Golden Flower.

1997 saw the release of Keep Cool, a small-scale film about life in modern
China. After its release, Zhang found a new leading lady in the form of the
young actress Zhang Ziyi. His 1999 film The Road Home, featuring Zhang Ziyi in
her film debut, is a simple throw-back narrative centering around a love story
between the narrator's parents. As in The Story of Qiu Ju, Zhang returned to
the neorealist habit of employing non-professional actors and location
shooting for the companion piece in Not One Less (1999),[citation needed]
which won him his second Golden Lion prize at Venice.[13]

### [edit] 2000-present

Happy Times, a relatively minor film by Zhang, represented his second foray
into modern Chinese city life. A seriocomic drama starring popular Chinese
actor Zhao Benshan and actress Dong Jie, it was an official selection for the
Berlin International Film Festival in 2002.

Zhang's next major project was the ambitious wuxia drama Hero (2002). The film
was a major change in direction for Zhang, as it represented his first foray
into epic filmmaking.[citation needed] Boasting an impressive lineup of Asian
stars, including Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Zhang Ziyi, and
Donnie Yen, Hero introduced a fictional tale revolving around Ying Zheng, the
king of the State of Qin (later the first Emperor of China) and his would-be
assassins. The film became a huge international hit and, with the intervention
of American director Quentin Tarantino, was released in North America two
years after its Chinese release after being shelved by American distributor
Miramax Films.[citation needed] Hero became one of the few foreign-language
films to debut at #1 at the U.S. box office,[14] and was one of the nominees
for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2003 Academy Awards.

Zhang followed up the huge success of Hero with another martial arts epic,
House of Flying Daggers, in 2004.[15] Set in the Tang Dynasty, it starred
Zhang Ziyi, Andy Lau, and Takeshi Kaneshiro as characters caught in a
dangerous love triangle. House of Flying Daggers was generally well-received
among critics, who noted the flamboyant use of color that harked back to some
of Zhang's earlier works.[16]

Released in China in 2005, Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles was a return to
the more low-key drama that characterized much of Zhang's middle period
pieces. The film stars legendary Japanese actor Ken Takakura, who wishes to
repair relations with his alienated son, eventually led by circumstance to set
out on a journey to China. Zhang had been an admirer of Takakura for over
thirty years.[17]

Zhang's most recent film, 2006's Curse of the Golden Flower, saw him reunite
with leading actress Gong Li. Taiwanese singer Jay Chou and Hong Kong star
Chow Yun-Fat also starred in the period epic based on a play by Cao Yu.[18]

Zhang's recent films and his involvement with the 2008 Olympics ceremony has
not been without controversy; critics of Zhang claim that his recent works
contrary to his earlier films has received approval from the government.[19]
However, Zhang in interviews has stated that he is not interested in
politics,[19] and it was an honor for him to direct the Olympics opening
ceremony because it was "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."[19]

## [edit] Stage direction

Beginning in the 1990s, Zhang Yimou began directing stage productions, as well
as continuing his film career. In 1998, Zhang directed an acclaimed version of
the music opera, Puccini's Turandot, at the Forbidden City, Beijing, with
Zubin Mehta as conductor.[20]

Zhang Yimou also directed a folk musical, Third Sister Liu ("Liu Sanjie"). It
began on 16 August 2003 and was performed in an outdoor scenic setting on the
Li River with a background of mountains in Yangshuo County of Guilin City in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.[21]

Zhang also led the production of Tan Dun's opera, The First Emperor, which had
its world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera on 21 December 2006.[22]

## [edit] 2008 Beijing Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies

Zhang was chosen to direct the Beijing portion of the closing Ceremonies of
the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, as well as the Opening Ceremony of
the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China alongside co-director and
choreographer Zhang Jigang.[23] He directed the Closing Ceremony with Zhang
Jigang as well.[23]

Zhang was a runner-up for Time Magazine Person of the Year 2008.[24] Steven
Spielberg, who withdrew as an adviser to the Olympic ceremonies to pressure
China to help with the conflict in Darfur, described Zhang's works in the
Olympic ceremony in the Time magazine, states: "At the heart of Zhang's
Olympic ceremonies was the idea that the conflict of man foretells the desire
for inner peace. This theme is one he's explored and perfected in his films,
whether they are about the lives of humble peasants or exalted royalty. This
year he captured this prevalent theme of harmony and peace, which is the
spirit of the Olympic Games. In one evening of visual and emotional splendor,
he educated, enlightened and entertained us all."[24]
