## [edit] Synopsis

The film begins with exposition on Tomas, a Czech brain surgeon (played by
Daniel Day-Lewis), who lives a carefree life as a lothario. His lover, Sabina
(Lena Olin), is an artist and is equally carefree. One day, Tomas leaves
Prague to conduct a brain operation in a spa town. There, he meets Tereza
(Juliette Binoche), a waitress who dreams of escaping her dreary life in the
spa town. She follows him back to Prague and moves in with him, which
complicates Tomas' sexual escapades with other women.

Tomas asks Sabina to help Tereza get work as a photographer. Tereza
experiences a mixture of fascination and jealousy as she realizes that Sabina
and Tomas have a sexual connection. Tereza's distress is interrupted by Soviet
tanks rolling into Czechoslovakia. In the midst of the confusion that follows,
Tereza takes pictures of the Soviet invasion and gives the film to foreigners
to smuggle to the West. All three characters flee to Geneva, Switzerland.
First Sabina, and after a while Tereza and Tomas.

In Switzerland, Sabina meets Franz, a married university professor, and they
begin a love affair. After some time, Franz announces to Sabina that he has
left his wife and family. After he makes this declaration, Sabina leaves Franz
(Derek de Lint) because she feels he would only weigh her down. Tereza and
Tomas attempt to adapt to Switzerland but Tereza discovers that Tomas has
continued his sexual liaisons with other women. She leaves him and returns to
Czechoslovakia. Tomas is upset by her leaving and decides to follow Tereza
back to Czechoslovakia even though his passport is confiscated. Upon his
return, Tereza is elated.

Tomas tries to get his old post as a brain surgeon but is stifled by the new
Soviet-backed regime regarding an article that he wrote prior to the Soviet
invasion in which he compared the Soviets to Oedipus Rex. Tomas wrote in his
article that Oedipus plucked out his eyes when he realized his crime but the
Soviets have not similarly acknowledged their crimes. The new regime asks him
to sign a letter repudiating the article but Tomas refuses. Because of this,
he is unable to practice medicine and gets work as a window washer and
continues his womanizing.

Tereza gets a job as a waitress and meets an engineer. Because she is once
again confronted with evidence of Tomas' infidelity, she decides to have an
affair with the engineer. Soon afterwards, she fears that the engineer may be
working for the new regime and that she and Tomas may be blackmailed
concerning the affair. In desperation she contemplates suicide but is
prevented by Tomas.

Tereza convinces Tomas to leave Prague and they go to a rural village where
they are welcomed by an old patient of Tomas'. There, they live an idyllic
life together as farmers, far away from the political intrigues of Prague. In
contrast to them, Sabina has gone to America where she continues to live her
single, bohemian lifestyle. In America, Sabina is shocked to receive a letter
that tells her that Tereza and Tomas have died in a truck accident while
driving back to their village after celebrating with their friends in another
town.

The film ends with Tomas and Tereza both in a state of deep happiness as they
drive back to their village shortly before their deaths.

## [edit] Production

The film is a United States production and was directed by an American, Philip
Kaufman, but it has a largely European cast, including Daniel Day-Lewis
(British), Juliette Binoche (French), Lena Olin (Swedish) and Derek de Lint
(Dutch). It was filmed in France rather than Czechoslovakia; in the scenes
depicting the Soviet invasion, real archive footage is combined with material
shot in Lyon for the film.

## [edit] Adaptation

Kundera considers[citation needed] his novels unsuited to being turned into
movies; in his opinion, they lose their essential qualities in the process,
leaving only the accessory stories to produce any intrigue. However, Kundera
served as an active (but uncredited) consultant during the making of the film.
In fact, the poem Tomas whispers into Tereza's ear as she is falling asleep
was written specifically for the film by Kundera.[2]

## [edit] Reception

The film garnered high praise from critics. The film criticism aggregation
website Rotten Tomatoes has The Unbearable Lightness of Being rated as 100%
"fresh" (positive).[1]. It is also listed as one of the top 100 love stories
in American Cinema by the American Film Institute [3]
