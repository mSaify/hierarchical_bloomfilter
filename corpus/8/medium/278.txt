Guy Maddin (born February 28, 1956) is a Canadian screenwriter and director of
both features and short films from Winnipeg, Manitoba. His most distinctive
quality is his penchant for recreating the look and style of silent or early
sound era films which has solidified his popularity and acclaim in alternative
film circles.

## [edit] Career

While Maddin strives to recreate the styles and moods of early film
melodramas, Weimar Republic German silent films, and 1920s Soviet agit-prop,
his own personal style lies in his use of clichÃ©s, psychosexual situations,
bizarre stories and humor. Reminiscent of the early work of American director
David Lynch, it is this self-conscious and surreal merging of early film-
making techniques with a post-modern sensibility that give Maddin's films a
style referred to as "Ultra-Conformist" or "Anti-Progressive". Assistance from
provincial and national Arts Councils as well as the Winnipeg Film Group aid
in Maddin's pursuit in the making of his films.

His film education came not with any formal training at a trade school, or his
experiences at the University of Winnipeg, but with endless weekends of
watching films with close friends John Paizs and Steve Snyder. Soon realizing
that Paizs was making and performing in his own post-modern films and Snyder
was teaching production at the University of Manitoba, Maddin eventually gave
up an unsatisfying day-job as a bank-teller and decided that he needed to put
his own knowledge to work and step behind the camera, in his case the popular
Bolex hand-wound camera.

Maddin's first film was the Winnipeg Film Group assisted 1986 16mm short film
The Dead Father. His first 16mm feature film was Tales from the Gimli
Hospital.

In 2007, Maddin became the first artist-curator of the UCLA Film and
Television Archive. In this position, he performs the programming for their
new "Curated by..." series.[1]

As of fall 2007, Maddin will be teaching film at the University of Manitoba.
Also in 2007, Maddin's film My Winnipeg won the Best Canadian Feature award at
the Toronto International Film Festival. The haunting track used in the film
is "Wonderful Winnipeg" by "The Swinging Strings" (vocal by Jim Wheeler)
issued in 1967 on the Eagle Records label of Winnipeg. Super Oldies
(www.superoldies.com) is issuing the track on an Eagle Records compilation CD
in 2008.

Maddin's films are often set in his home town of Winnipeg and are usually set
in abstract 20th century historical periods. Themes in Maddin's films
frequently include unrequited love, murder, Soviet Russia, homoeroticism,
incest, dismemberment and the workings of human impulse and subconscious.
