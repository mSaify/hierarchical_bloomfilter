Shortbus is a 2006 American comedy-drama film written and directed by John
Cameron Mitchell, writer/director/star of the play and film Hedwig and the
Angry Inch.

The plot revolves around a sexually diverse ensemble of emotionally challenged
people trying desperately to connect in bohemian New York City. The characters
converge on a weekly Brooklyn artistic/sexual salon loosely inspired by
various underground NYC gatherings that took place in the early 2000s.
According to Mitchell, the film attempts to "employ sex in new cinematic
ways", and it includes a variety of explicit scenes of sexuality.

It was released in North America on October 13, 2006, distributed by
THINKFilm, after premiering in May at the Cannes Film Festival, and it played
in over 25 countries, winning multiple awards at the Athens, Zurich, and Gijon
film festivals. Howard Gertler and Tim Perell received an Independent Spirit
Award as Producers of the Year. The film was released to DVD in North America
on March 13, 2007. The DVD features a comprehensive documentary, "Gifted and
Challenged: the Making of Shortbus" (Director/producer M. Sean Kaminsky), the
vÃ©ritÃ©-style "How to Shoot Sex: A Docu-Primer", deleted scenes (including a
dropped subplot about a character who is the Bush twins' personal assistant),
as well as a filmmaker/cast audio commentary.

## [edit] Plot

Jay Brannan and Sook-Yin Lee

The movie is set in contemporary New York City and revolves around Sofia
(Sook-Yin Lee), who is married to the attractive but dimwitted Rob (Raphael
Barker). She works as a couples counselor/sex therapist who has, herself,
never achieved an orgasm. She comes into contact with a couple: former child
star Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson). The soft-spoken James, a former
prostitute, is the film's other main character. At the outset, James suggests
to his boyfriend that they open up their relationship to sex with others.

During their first consultation, Sofia snaps, slaps Jamie, and apologetically
reveals her "pre-orgasmic" status. The couple suggests she attend a weekly
social/artistic/sexual salon in Brooklyn called "Shortbus", which is hosted by
drag performance artist Justin Bond (playing himself). Bond is well-known in
the alternative cabaret world as Kiki of Kiki & Herb. Sofia slowly opens up to
new experiences; this includes a friendship with a dominatrix who goes by the
name Severin (Lindsay Beamish), which was the name of the masochist
protagonist of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's classic novel Venus in Furs.
Sofia's inability to achieve orgasm begins to cause conflict with her husband
Rob. Rob begins attending Shortbus with Sofia.

James and Jamie meet a young ex-model and aspiring singer named Ceth
(pronounced "Seth", and portrayed by Jay Brannan) and the three begin a sexual
relationship. Meanwhile James and Jamie's life is being closely watched by
their across-the-street stalker neighbor Caleb (Peter Stickles). Caleb fears
the inclusion of Ceth in James and Jamie's relationship might break them up
and thus destroy his ability to live vicariously through them, so he attends
Shortbus, where he confronts Ceth.

PJ DeBoy and Paul Dawson

Sofia begins to go daily to a spa with a sensory deprivation tank to meet with
Severin, and the two begin to have intense conversations. Severin begins to
help Sofia loosen up sexually; Sofia helps Severin achieve a deeper human
connection than she had experienced before. One evening at Shortbus, Severin
discusses with Sofia the idea of giving up sex work to pursue her dream of
being an artist. The two then have an unplanned sexual experience, and once
again Sofia is left unsatisfied.

Throughout the film we see James making a film about himself and his
relationship. It turns out to be a suicide note. He attempts to take his own
life and is rescued by his stalker Caleb, who calls for help but is too
embarrassed to wait with James for the help to arrive. He writes his phone
number and email address on James' face while he is unconscious. When James
wakes in the hospital, he calls Caleb. James goes to Caleb's home to be
consoled, but does not contact Jamie or Ceth, neither of whom can understand
why he wouldn't call them or come home.

There follows an interlocking trio of scenes showing connections between the
characters' emotional problems and their sexual lives.

  * At Caleb's house, he and James have sex, and James allows Caleb to penetrate him, something he has never allowed anyone to do before. Afterward, in a dramatic revelation, James is seen in the window of Caleb's apartment by Jamie, who realizes in that moment that James is alive and okay.
  * Rob and Severin have a paid encounter where Rob asks to be beaten, something he couldn't ask Sofia to do. As this progresses, Severin loses control and Rob tries to comfort her.
  * Sofia seems to have a dream of struggling through an overgrown, wild forested area to a gentle seashore where she tries to achieve orgasm again. On failing, she screams, and in the real world the lights go off across the city, seemingly caused by the simultaneous and collective frustration of the characters.

The film ends with a song by Justin Bond at Shortbus during the blackout.
Sofia arrives and finds Rob with Severin and after acknowledging him sits down
by herself. James and Jamie also arrive followed by Ceth and Caleb.

Justin's song starts on a wistful note, but as it progresses it becomes more
energetic and positive thanks to the arrival of the Hungry March Band. This is
mirrored in the actions and emotions of the actors. Jamie and James make out
on the floor, and Ceth and Caleb start to hit it off. Rob seems to find a
friend, and Severin progresses from nervous anxiety to happy elation upon the
arrival of the band.

While having a threesome with a couple whom she has seen several times before
and appear to meet her prerequisites of "just beginning to experiment
sexually" (Nick and Leah, played by Jan Hilmer and Shanti Carson), Sofia
finally achieves an orgasm, and the blackout affecting New York ends, as does
the film.

Mandell was a great friend and collaborator of playwright Samuel Beckett and was directed by him in Waiting For Godot and Endgame. They met after Mandell co-founded the San Quentin Prison Drama Workshop in the mid-60s which produced works of Beckett, among other playwrights. Mandell introduced Mitchell to Beckett in Paris in 1988, the year before Beckett died.
  * PJ DeBoy appeared as the Hedhead with dreads in the scene where Hedwig recounts her Tommy Gnosis stories atop a big pile of tires.

## [edit] Public reaction

Sofia observing the Sex-Not-Bombs Room

Some have branded the film "pornographic". In response, Mitchell says that the
dictionary defines porn as "material created and viewed for the primary
purpose of sexual arousal," and argues that the sex in Shortbus is often
purposefully "de-eroticized" to "remove the cloud of arousal to reveal
emotions and ideas that might have been obscured by it".

â Sex, like music, is a universal language. We want to use it to introduce
character, evoke emotion, propel the plot. Sex is also the funniest thing I
know. How the hell do we find ourselves in those positions? - Mitchell â  
Lee was nearly fired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, for which she
hosts a radio program Definitely Not the Opera because of her participation in
several unsimulated sexual scenes in the film. Ultimately, she retained her
job as the CBC relented in the face of support for Lee from the public,[2] as
well as from celebrities such as Francis Ford Coppola, Michael Stipe, Moby and
Yoko Ono.[3]

## [edit] Production

<IMG>

<IMG>

Barker, Lee and Mitchell

The film's characters and story were created collaboratively over 2 1/2 years
through improvisation workshops with the cast. The audition website elicited
half a million hits and 500 audition tape submissions. 40 people were called
in for improv auditions and nine actors were cast, all before there was any
story in mind. Mitchell wrote the screenplay from the raw material generated
by the workshops and rehearsals.

Much of the sex in this movie is unsimulated. Mitchell says:

â In the old days, when you couldn't show sex on film, directors like
Hitchcock had metaphors for sex (trains going into tunnels, etc). When you can
show more realistic sex, the sex itself can be a metaphor for other parts of
the character's lives. The way people express themselves sexually can tell you
a lot about who they are. Some people ask me, 'Couldn't you have told the same
story without the explicitness?'. They don't ask whether I could've done
Hedwig without the songs. Why not be allowed to use every paint in the
paintbox? â  
As indicated in the DVD special features, Lee and Shanti Carson each suggested
they be filmed having real orgasms rather than fake them, specifically for the
final scene involving Lee and the orgy sequence involving Carson. Mitchell
also participated in the latter scene, performing oral sex on a woman for the
first time "as a gesture of solidarity".[4]

The panoramic cityscape interspersed through the film was completely computer-
generated and designed by John Bair.

### [edit] Inspiration

The characters all converge on a weekly underground gathering or salon called
Shortbus, inspired by the short yellow school buses for "challenged" students.
The Shortbus salon was loosely based on a series of New York
social/artistic/sexual gatherings. One was the monthly "Shortbus Sweaty
Teenage Dance Party" organized by Mitchell (circa 2002) as "DJ Dear Tic", his
Radical Faerie nickname (Mitchell was influenced by annual Radical Faerie
counter-cultural gatherings in Tennessee and New Orleans). Others influences
include the Lusty Loft Parties that took place at a Brooklyn art collective
called DUMBA (where the film's salon was actually shot), and the weekly
CineSalon film gathering, both of which were organized, in part, by Stephen
Kent Jusick who plays Creamy in the film. The still-running underground
Rubulad party was also an inspiration.

The character of Tobias â the elderly man who claims to be an ex-Mayor of
New York City â played by Alan Mandell, alludes to Mayor Ed Koch, who has
long been the subject of rumors about his sexual orientation.

### [edit] Jokes

There is a plot device involving a vibrating egg with the brand name In the
Realm of the Senses. This is a wink to the explicit 1976 Nagisa Oshima film of
the same name in which a man urges his lover to insert a hard-boiled egg in
her vagina and "lay it".

Justin Bond's line: "As my dear, departed friend Lotus Weinstock used to say,
'I used to want to change the world. Now I just want to leave the room with a
little dignity'" refers to a stand-up line from real-life comedian Lotus
Weinstock, a Los Angeles-based performer who was Lenny Bruce's last
girlfriend. Mitchell was friendly with Weinstock and her daughter, singer-
songwriter Lili Haydn, before Weinstock died in 1997.

The film playing in the first Shortbus salon scene is, in effect, an elaborate
"erotic" joke. It's entitled "Saverio" and was directed by Mitchell as a
tribute to a 70's-era short film called "Calma". The score song is "Kids" by
John LaMonica which appears on the film soundtrack. (Link to full version of
"Saverio": [1])

## [edit] Soundtrack

The soundtrack was released on Conor Oberst's record label, Team Love.
Mitchell directed the music video for Bright Eyes' "First Day of My Life"
(which featured Shortbus cast members Bitch, Daniela Sea, and Ray Rivas). The
soundtrack was released in Europe on V2 with the Anita O'Day song replaced by
"What Matters To Me" by Tiebreaker (John LaMonica). In Europe, the film found
its largest audiences in France and Italy. (The Italian poster featured a
hidden bomb in an artist's rendition of the Sex-Not-Bombs Room.)
