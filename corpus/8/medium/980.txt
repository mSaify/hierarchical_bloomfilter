The Gods Must Be Crazy is a film released in 1980, written and directed by
Jamie Uys. Set in Botswana and South Africa, it tells the story of Xi, a Sho
of the Kalahari Desert (played by Namibian San farmer NÇxau) whose tribe has
no knowledge of the world beyond. The film is followed by four sequels, the
final three of which were made in Hong Kong.

## [edit] Plot

The film is a collision of three separate storiesâthe journey of a bushman
to the end of the earth to destroy a Coca-Cola bottle, the romance between a
bumbling scientist and a schoolteacher, and a band of guerrillas on the run.

The members of Xi's tribe are living well off the land in the Kalahari Desert.
They are happy because the gods have provided plenty of everything, no one in
the tribe has unfilled wants. One day, a glass Coke bottle is thrown out of an
aeroplane and falls to earth unbroken. Initially, this strange artifact seems
to be another boon from the godsâXi's people find many uses for it. But
unlike anything that they have had before, there is only one bottle to go
around. This exposes the tribe to a hitherto unknown phenomenon, property, and
they soon find themselves experiencing things they never had before: jealousy,
envy, anger, hatred, even violence.

Xi decides that the bottle is an evil thing and must be thrown off of the edge
of the world. He sets out alone on his quest and encounters Western
civilization for the first time. The film presents an interesting
interpretation of civilization as viewed through Xi's perceptions.

There are also plot lines about shy biologist Andrew Steyn (Marius Weyers) who
is studying the local animals; the newly-hired village school teacher, a
former newspaper reporter named Kate Thompson (Sandra Prinsloo); and some
guerrillas led by Sam Boga (Louw Verwey), who are being pursued by government
troops after an unsuccessful attempt to massacre a fictional African country's
Cabinet. Also taking a share of the limelight is Steyn's Land Rover, dubbed
the Antichrist (also Son of Maraka) by his assistant and mechanic, M'pudi
(Michael Thys), for its unreliability and constant need of repair. Also part
of the chaos is a fresh safari tour guide named Jack Hind (Nic de Jager), who
has designs on Thompson and would often steal Steyn's thunder.

Xi happens upon a farm and, being hungry as well as oblivious to the concept
of ownership, shoots a goat with a tranquilizer arrow. For this he is arrested
and jailed for stealing livestock. M'pudi, who lived with the bushmen for a
long time, realizes that Xi will die in the alien environment of a prison
cell. He and Steyn manage to hire Xi as a tracker for the 11 weeks of his
prison sentence, with the help of M'pudi, who speaks Xi's language. Meanwhile,
the guerrillas invade the school where Kate teaches and use her and her pupils
as human shields for their escape by foot to the neighboring country. Steyn
and Xi manage to immobilize the guerrillas as they are passing by and save
Kate and the children. Steyn allows Xi to leave to continue his quest to the
edge of the world.

Xi prepares to throw the Coke bottle off the end of the earth.

Xi eventually finds himself at the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-
lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. This convinces Xi that he has
reached the edge of the world, and he throws the bottle off the cliff. This
scene was filmed at a place called God's Window in the then-Eastern Transvaal,
South Africa (now Mpumalanga). This is at the edge of the escarpment between
the Highveld and Lowveld of South Africa. Xi then returns to his tribe and
receives a warm welcome.

## [edit] Themes and reception

The first two films present the JuÇÊ¼hoansi as noble savages leading a
simple, fairly utopian life in contrast with Western culture. Initially, the
arrival of a Coca-Cola bottle, thrown from a passing light aircraft,
represents the only exposure that the JuÇÊ¼hoansi have with Western culture.
Richard Lee, an anthropologist who studied the JuÇÊ¼hoansi, argues that the
film's representation of the group was a "cruel caricature of reality" given
the decades of highly problematic social changes.[1] In Namibia, the
JuÇÊ¼hoansi were relocated and forced to abandon their foraging lifestyle in
favor of government food handouts so that, by the time of filming, the Bushmen
actors had long ceased to be hunter-gatherers and were even confused by the
instructions given to them by the directors, as briefly demonstrated in the
film N!ai, the Story of a !Kung Woman. Even before this rapid change, the
JuÇÊ¼hoansi had not been completely untouched by surrounding cultures and a
single foreign artifact would not have upset the society's equilibrium.

While Western audiences found the films funny, there was considerable debate
about its racial politics.[citation needed] The portrayal of Xi (particularly
in the first film) as incapable of understanding the gods was viewed as
insulting by some, including the government of Trinidad and Tobago, which
consequently banned the film. However, its many fans believe that it is
exactly the opposite, a send-up of so-called civilization and condemnation of
racism with Xi as the hero. The film's progression from documentary style to
comedy to the fantastical ending reveal its allegorical point.

Some of the debate centered on Xi's reaction to the first white people he met,
assuming they were gods since they were strange (he had only known other Sho
before), had road vehicles (which he also had never seen before), and were
comparatively huge. However, within minutes he began doubting they were gods.
The second film clearly shows Xi's greater understanding as he tells the
children about the people he had met: "Heavy people... who seem to know some
magic that can make things move," but are "not very bright, because they can't
survive without their magic contrivances."

The films' depictions of the Bushmen, even if they were superficially accurate
in the decades before the rapid social changes of the 1970s and 1980s, are
clearly no longer accurate. The DVD's special feature "Journey to Nyae Nyae"
(N!xau's homeland in northeastern Namibia), filmed in 2003, demonstrates this.

Despite the film having grossed over $100 million worldwide, NÇxau reportedly
earned less than $2000 for his starring role. Before his death, Uys
supplemented this with an additional $20,000 as well as a monthly stipend.[2]

## [edit] Sequels

### [edit] The Gods Must Be Crazy II

Main article: The Gods Must Be Crazy II

A sequel, The Gods Must Be Crazy II, was filmed in 1985 but not released until
1989. Xi's name was changed to Xixo in this film. In it, Xixo's two young
children encounter poachers in the Kalahari and explore the back of their
truck, and become unable to jump off once it starts moving. Xixo must once
again travel great distances to retrieve them, and once again encounters
various other western characters who are on quests of their own. The film is
notable for the increased role of animals throughout the story, and for its
light-hearted treatment of the civil war still raging in nearby Angola at the
time.

### [edit] The Gods Must Be Crazy III-V

N!xau was featured in three low-budget Hong Kong film comedies that continued
the fish-out-of-water aspects of the original films. They were filmed in
Cantonese and dubbed in other languages. There was also a fourth film that,
while unrelated to the series, was marketed on video in some markets as The
Gods Must Be Crazy IV.

Be Funny was recently released on DVD in South Africa.[3]

### [edit] Jewel of the Gods

The South African film Jewel of the Gods, which also starred Marius Weyers and
Sandra Prinsloo, was marketed as a sequel to The Gods Must Be Crazy. [4]

## [edit] In popular culture

  * A brief flashback echoing the final scene of the film is mentioned in an episode of bro'Town. Minor character Joost van der Van Van recalls during his childhood in South Africa that he once followed a close friend on a journey to throw a coke bottle off a high cliff, even though he thought it was quite silly.
  * The band !!! took its name from the subtitles of the film which represent the clicking sounds of the Bushmen as exclamation marks.
  * The music video for Take Me To Your Leader by the American alternative rock band Incubus is based on the film. Lead singer Brandon Boyd plays the role of a savage who has a Coca-Cola bottle land on his head from out of the sky. He spends the rest of the video trying to give the bottle back to whoever it belongs to.
