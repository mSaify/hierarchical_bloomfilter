In Search of Lost Time or Remembrance of Things Past (French: Ã la recherche
du temps perdu) is a semi-autobiographical novel in seven volumes by Marcel
Proust. His most prominent work, it is popularly known for its extended length
and the notion of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the
"episode of the madeleine". The novel is still widely referred to in English
as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a more
accurate rendering of the French, has gained in usage since D.J. Enright's
1992 revision of the earlier translation by C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence
Kilmartin.

Begun in 1909, finished just before his death in 1922, and published in France
between 1913 and 1927, many of the novel's ideas, motifs, and scenes appear in
adumbrated form in Proust's unfinished novel, Jean Santeuil (1896â99), and
in his unfinished hybrid of philosophical essay and story, Contre Sainte-Beuve
(1908â09). The novel has had a pervasive influence on twentieth-century
literature, whether because writers have sought to emulate it, or attempted to
parody and discredit some of its traits. In it, Proust explores the themes of
time, space, and memory, but the novel is above all a condensation of
innumerable literary, structural, stylistic, and thematic possibilities.

Proust died before completing his revisions of the drafts and proofs of the
final volumes. His brother Robert edited the last three volumes, which were
published posthumously.

Volume 1: Du cÃ´tÃ© de chez Swann (1913) was rejected by a number of
publishers, including Fasquelle, Ollendorf, and the Nouvelle Revue FranÃ§aise
(NRF). Proust eventually arranged with the publisher Grasset to pay for the
costs of publication himself. When published it was advertised as the first of
a three-volume novel (Bouillaguet and Rogers, 316-7).

Du cÃ´tÃ© de chez Swann is divided into four parts: "Combray I" (sometimes
referred to in English as the "Overture"), "Combray II," "Un Amour de Swann,"
and "Noms de pays: le nom." A third-person novella within Du cÃ´tÃ© de chez
Swann, "Un Amour de Swann" is sometimes published as a volume by itself. As it
forms the self-contained story of Charles Swann's love affair with Odette de
CrÃ©cy and is relatively short, it is generally considered a good introduction
to the work and is often a set text in French schools. "Combray I" is also
similarly excerpted.

In early 1914, AndrÃ© Gide, who had been involved in NRF's rejection of the
book, wrote to Proust to apologize and to offer congratulations on the novel.
"For several days I have been unable to put your book down.... The rejection
of this book will remain the most serious mistake ever made by the NRF and,
since I bear the shame of being very much responsible for it, one of the most
stinging and remorseful regrets of my life" (TadiÃ©, 611). Gallimard (the
publishing arm of NRF) offered to publish the remaining volumes, but Proust
chose to stay with Grasset.

Volume 2: Ã l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (1919), scheduled to be
published in 1914, was delayed by the onset of World War I. At the same time,
Grasset's firm was closed down when the publisher went into military service.
This freed Proust to move to Gallimard, where all the subsequent volumes were
published. Meanwhile, the novel kept growing in length and in conception.

Ã l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1919.

Volume 3: Le CÃ´tÃ© de Guermantes originally appeared as Le CÃ´tÃ© de
Guermantes I (1920) and Le CÃ´tÃ© de Guermantes II (1921).

Volume 4: The first forty pages of Sodome et Gomorrhe initially appeared at
the end of Le CÃ´tÃ© de Guermantes II (Bouillaguet and Rogers, 942), the
remainder appearing as Sodome et Gomorrhe I (1921) and Sodome et Gomorrhe II
(1922). It was the last volume over which Proust supervised publication before
his death in November 1922. The publication of the remaining volumes was
carried out by his brother, Robert Proust, and Jacques RiviÃ¨re.

Volume 5: La PrisonniÃ¨re (1923), first volume of the section of the novel
known as "le Roman d'Albertine" ("the Albertine novel"). The name "Albertine"
first appears in Proust's notebooks in 1913. The material in these volumes was
developed during the hiatus between the publication of Volumes 1 and 2, and
they are a departure from the three-volume series announced by Proust in Du
cÃ´tÃ© de chez Swann.

Volume 6: La Fugitive or Albertine disparue (1925) is the most editorially
vexed volume. As noted, the final three volumes of the novel were published
posthumously, and without Proust's final corrections and revisions. The first
edition, based on Proust's manuscript, was published as Albertine disparue to
prevent it from being confused with Rabindranath Tagore's La Fugitive
(1921).[1] The first definitive edition of the novel in French (1954), also
based on Proust's manuscript, used the title La Fugitive. The second, even-
more-definitive French edition (1987-89) uses the title Albertine disparue and
is based on an unmarked typescript acquired in 1962 by the BibliothÃ¨que
Nationale. To complicate matters, after the death in 1986 of Proust's niece,
Suzy Mante-Proust, her son-in-law discovered among her papers a typescript
that had been corrected and annotated by Proust. The late changes Proust made
include a small, crucial detail and the deletion of approximately 150 pages.
This version was published as Albertine disparue in France in 1987.

Volume 7: Much of Le Temps retrouvÃ© (1927) was written at the same time as Du
cÃ´tÃ© de chez Swann, but was revised and expanded during the course of the
novel's publication to account for, to a greater or lesser success, the then
unforeseen material now contained in the middle volumes (Terdiman, 153n3).
This volume includes a noteworthy episode describing Paris during the First
World War.

## [edit] Publication in English

The first six volumes were first translated into English by the Scotsman C. K.
Scott Moncrieff between 1922 and his death in 1930 under the title Remembrance
of Things Past, a phrase taken from Shakespeare's Sonnet 30; this was the
first translation of the Recherche into another language. The final volume, Le
Temps retrouvÃ©, was initially published in English in the UK as Time Regained
(1931), translated by Stephen Hudson (a pseudonym of Sydney Schiff), and in
the US as The Past Recaptured (1932) in a translation by Frederick Blossom.
Although cordial with Scott Moncrieff, Proust grudgingly remarked in a letter
that Remembrance eliminated the correspondence between Temps perdu and Temps
retrouvÃ© (Painter, 352). Terence Kilmartin revised the Scott Moncrieff
translation in 1981, using the new French edition of 1954. An additional
revision by D.J. Enright \- that is, a revision of a revision - was published
by the Modern Library in 1992. It is based on the latest and most
authoritative French text (1987â89), and rendered the title of the novel
more literally as In Search of Lost Time.

In 1995, Penguin undertook a fresh translation of In Search of Lost Time by
editor Christopher Prendergast and seven different translators, one
Australian, one American, and the others English. Based on the authoritative
French text (of 1987-98), it was published in six volumes in Britain under the
Allen Lane imprint in 2002. The first four (those which under American
copyright law are in the public domain) have since been published in the US
under the Viking imprint and in paperback under the Penguin Classics imprint.
The remaining volumes are scheduled to come out in 2018.

Both the Modern Library and Penguin translations provide a detailed plot
synopsis at the end of each volume. The last volume of the Modern Library
edition, Time Regained, also includes Kilmartin's "A Guide to Proust," an
index of the novel's characters, persons, places, and themes. The Modern
Library volumes include a handful of endnotes, and alternative versions of
some of the novel's famous episodes. The Penguin volumes each provide an
extensive set of brief, non-scholarly endnotes that help identify cultural
references perhaps unfamiliar to contemporary English readers.

Reviews which discuss the merits of both translations can be found online at
the Observer, the Telegraph, The New York Review of Books (subscription only),
The New York Times, and TempsPerdu.com

## [edit] Themes

The role of memory is central to the novel, hence the famous episode with the
madeleine in the first volume. When the narrator's grandmother dies, her agony
is depicted as her seeming to fall apart; particularly, as her memories seem
to flow out of her, she loses contact with it. In the last volume, Time
Regained, a flashback similar to the madeleines episode is the beginning of
the resolution of the story. The narrator is transported back to an earlier
time by sensory experiences of memory, triggered by smells, sights, sounds, or
touch.

A large part of the novel has to do with the nature of art. Proust sets forth
a theory of art in which we all are capable of producing art, if by art we
mean taking the experiences of life and transforming them in a way that shows
understanding and maturity. Music is also discussed at great length. Morel,
the violinist, is examined to give an example of a certain type of "artistic"
character. The artistic value of Richard Wagner's music is also discussed.

Homosexuality is a major theme in the novel, especially in Sodom and Gomorrah
and subsequent volumes. Though the narrator himself is heterosexual, he
invariably suspects his lovers of liaisons with other women. Similarly,
Charles Swann, the central figure in much of the first volume, suspects his
mistress Odette (whom he later marries) has had such encounters, something she
subsequently admits to him is true. Several lesser characters are forthrightly
homosexual, like the Baron de Charlus; while others, like the narrator's good
friend Robert de Saint-Loup, are only later revealed to be closeted. Despite
the novel's semi-autobiographical nature, it should be noted that Proust
himself was openly gay.

In 1949, the critic Justin O'Brien published an article in the PMLA called
"Albertine the Ambiguous: Notes on Proust's Transposition of Sexes" which
proposed that some female characters are best understood as actually referring
to young men. Strip off the feminine ending of the names of the Narrator's
lovers â Albertine, Gilberte, AndrÃ©e â and one has their masculine
counterpart. This theory has become known as the "transposition of sexes
theory" in Proust criticism, which in turn has been challenged in Epistemology
of the Closet (1992) by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick.

Proust wove World War I into his story, including an aerial bombardment of
Paris; the narrator's boyhood haunts have become a battlefield, with 600,000
Germans lost in the struggle for MÃ©sÃ©glise, and Combray itself divided
between the opposing armies.

Although Proust wrote contemporaneously with Sigmund Freud, neither author
read a word of the other's work (Bragg). Dr. Howard Hertz of Pasadena City
College has compared Proust with the work of the Freudian theorist Melanie
Klein.[citation needed]

## [edit] Main characters

The Narrator's household

  * The narrator: A sensitive young man who wishes to become a writer, whose identity is kept explicitly vague. In volume 5, The Prisoner, he addresses the reader thus: "Now she began to speak; her first words were 'darling' or 'my darling,' followed by my Christian name, which, if we give the narrator the same name as the author of this book, would produce 'darling Marcel' or 'my darling Marcel.'" (Proust, 64)
  * Bathilde AmÃ©dÃ©e: The narrator's grandmother. Her life and death greatly influence her daughter and grandson.
  * FranÃ§oise: The narrator's faithful, stubborn maid.

The Guermantes

  * PalamÃ¨de de Guermantes (Baron de Charlus): An aristocratic, decadent aesthete with many antisocial habits.
  * Oriane de Guermantes (Duchesse de Guermantes): The toast of Paris' high society. She lives in the fashionable Faubourg St. Germain.
  * Robert de Saint-Loup: An army officer and the narrator's best friend. Despite his patrician birth (he is the nephew of M. de Guermantes) and affluent lifestyle, Saint-Loup has no great fortune of his own until he marries Gilberte.

The Swanns

  * Charles Swann: A friend of the narrator's family. His political views on the Dreyfus Affair and marriage to Odette ostracize him from much of high society.
  * Odette de CrÃ©cy: A beautiful Parisian courtesan. Odette is also referred to as Mme Swann, the woman in pink/white, and in the final volume, Mme de Forcheville.
  * Gilberte Swann: The daughter of Swann and Odette. She takes the name of her adopted father, M. de Forcheville, after Swann's death, and then becomes Mme de Saint-Loup following her marriage to Robert de Saint-Loup, which joins Swann's Way and the Guermantes Way.

Artists

  * Elstir: A famous painter whose renditions of sea and sky echo the novel's theme of the mutability of human life.
  * Bergotte: A well-known writer whose works the narrator has admired since childhood.
  * Vinteuil: An obscure musician who gains posthumous recognition for composing a beautiful, evocative sonata.

Others

  * Charles Morel: The son of a former servant of the narrator's uncle and a gifted violinist. He profits greatly from the patronage of the Baron de Charlus and later Robert de Saint-Loup.
  * Albertine Simonet: A privileged orphan of average beauty and intelligence. The narrator's romance with her is the subject of much of the novel.
  * Sidonie Verdurin: A poseur who rises to the top of society through inheritance, marriage, and sheer single-mindedness. Often referred to simply as Mme. Verdurin.

## [edit] Legacy

In Search of Lost Time is considered the definitive Modern novel by many
scholars, and it had a profound effect on subsequent writers such as the
Bloomsbury Group.[2] "Oh if I could write like that!" marveled Virginia Woolf
in 1922 (2:525). More recently, literary critic Harold Bloom wrote that In
Search of Lost Time is now "widely recognized as the major novel of the
twentieth century."[3]

Vladimir Nabokov, in a 1965 interview[4] with Robert Hughes, named the
greatest prose works of the 20th century in his opinion. They were, in order,
"Joyce's Ulysses, Kafka's The Metamorphosis, Biely's Petersburg, and the first
half of Proust's fairy tale In Search of Lost Time."

Since the publication in 1992 of a revised English translation by The Modern
Library, based on a new definitive French edition (1987â89), interest in
Proust's novel in the English-speaking world has notably increased. Two
substantial new biographies have appeared in English, by Edmund White and
William C. Carter, and at least two books about the experience of reading
Proust have appeared, by Alain de Botton and Phyllis Rose.

Founded in 1997, the Proust Society of America now has three chapters: at The
Mercantile Library of New York City,[5] the Mechanic's Institute Library in
San Francisco,[6] and the Boston AthenÃ¦um Library.

In J. Peder Zane's book The Top Ten: Writers Pick Their Favorite Books, which
collates 125 "top 10 greatest books of all time" lists made by prominent
living writers, In Search of Lost Time places eighth.[7]

The French phenomenologist, Merleau-Ponty, frequently references Swann's Way
to help elucidate his own ideas.

### [edit] Influence on Other Authors

  * Proust's influence on Evelyn Waugh is manifest in A Handful of Dust (1934) in which Waugh entitles Chapter 1 "Du Cote de Chez Beaver" and Chapter 6 "Du Cote de Chez Tod." (Troubled Legacies, ed. Allan Hepburn, p. 256)

  * In Curtis Jean-Louis' 1957 novel Ã la recherche du temps posthume, Proust returns to earth and is instructed, by the cast of In Search of Lost Time, in how and why the "psychological novel" has been abandoned for the nouveau roman.
  * Monty Python's Flying Circus parodied the novel in a 1972 sketch called "The All-England Summarise Proust Competition" in which competitors had to summarize the book in 15 seconds. The novel had previously been mentioned by its French title in the 1970 sketch "Fish Licence" when Eric Praline (John Cleese), after proclaiming that "the late, great, Marcel Proust had an 'addock!" insists: "If you are calling the author of A la Recherche du Temps Perdu a looney...I SHALL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO STEP OUTSIDE!"
  * Chapter 10 of Umberto Eco's 1988 novel Foucault's Pendulum contains several explicit references to In Search of Lost Time.
  * Georges Perec wrote an article entitled 35 variations sur un thÃ¨me de Marcel Proust in 1974, in which he turned the novel's famous opening line into, among others, a version for athletes ('longtemps je me suis douchÃ© de bonne heure') and one for auto-erotomaniacs ('longtemps je me suis touchÃ© de bonne heure').
  * Russell Baker wrote a satiric editorial piece entitled "Crawling Up Everest" for his newspaper column, in which he and a trained reader attempt to read the novel.
  * Beat author and poet Jack Kerouac holds Proust as one of his crowning influences and refers to In Search of Lost Time in his works.
  * Italian director Fabio Capri has made two films loosely based on Proust's works: Quartetto Basileus (1982), which uses segments from Sodom and Gomorrah and Time Regained, and Le Intermittenze del cuore (2003), a film about a director working on a movie concerning Proust's life. (Beugnet and Marion Schmid, 206).
  * In the 2006 film Little Miss Sunshine, Steve Carrell's character is one of the world's leading Proust scholars, and the movie contains several allusions to In Search of Lost Time.
  * In the film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Cate Blanchett's character reads In Search of Lost Time aloud to her unborn child.
  * In Dan Simmons' duology Ilium, one of the main characters, a Moravec cyborg named Orphu of Io, quotes Proust on many occasions, primarily In Search of Lost time.
  * In episode seven of the Korean drama My Lovely Sam Soon, the main character eats a madeleine and makes a reference to In Search of Lost Time.
  * In the 2002 Korean movie entitled Madeleine, the character of Jo Insung makes a reference to the madeleine story of In Search of Lost Time.
  * In the pilot episode of the FX television series Dirt, main character Lucy Spiller encounters a young man reading a book. When he mentions the entire course of the novel is predicated upon a character dipping a cookie in some tea, she impresses him by replying that it is not just any cookie, but a madeleine.
  * In Gilmore Girls, Max lets Lorelai borrow his copy of Swann's Way; she is unable to read further than the first few pages, and her attempts to return the volume and break off the relationship form much of the plot of the episode "Paris is Burning." Rory also references the book in her valedictory speech at her graduation from Chilton.
  * In Duane's Depressed, part of Larry McMurtry's series that includes The Last Picture Show, characters in a book club read and discuss In Search of Lost Time.
  * In Dare the 2007 debut novel by BET host Abiola Abrams, a student on the train reads In Search of Lost Time while listening to Believe by Lenny Kravitz.
  * Two copies of Remembrance of Things Past appear in episode 7 of the CBS vampire/crime drama Moonlight, entitled "The Ringer."
  * Referenced by Dr. Melfi in The Sopranos season 3 episode where Tony is reminded of his childhood after biting into a capicola sandwich.
  * The title of Andy Warhol's 1955 book, A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu, glibly references Proust's novel. The publication marked Warhol's "transition from commercial to gallery artist".[10]
  * In A Zed and Two Noughts by Peter Greenaway two women are killed and one loses a leg in an auto accident resulting from a large female mute swan entering their Ford Mercury through the front windshield; this takes place on Swann's Way.
  * The Columbia, SC-based rock band The Madeleine Haze chose that name after the episode of the madeleine. Their debut album, "In Search Of Lost Time" is, according to the liner notes, an attempt to "use music as the madeleine".
