### [edit] Early life

Theo van Doesburg was born as Christian Emil Marie KÃ¼pper on 30 August 1883
in Utrecht as the son of the photographer Wilhelm KÃ¼pper and Henrietta
Catherina Margadant. After a short training in acting and singing he decided
to become a painter. He always regarded his stepfather, Theodorus Doesburg, to
be his natural father, so that his first works are signed with Theo Doesburg,
to which he later added the insertion "van". His first exhibition was in 1908.
He supported his works by copying paintings from the Rijksmuseum[citation
needed] and, from 1912 onwards, writing for magazines. Although he considered
himself to be a modern painter at that time, his early work is in line with
the Amsterdam Impressionists and is influenced by Vincent van Gogh, both in
style and subject matter. This suddenly changed in 1913 after reading Wassily
Kandinsky's RÃ¼ckblicke, in which he looks back at his life as a painter from
1903-1913. It made him realize there was a higher, more spiritual level in
painting that originates from the mind rather than from everyday life, and
that abstraction is the only logical outcome of this.

### [edit] The De Stijl movement

It was while reviewing an exposition for one of these magazines he wrote for,
in 1915 (halfway through his two-year service in the army), that he came in
contact with the works of Piet Mondrian, who was eight years older than him,
and had by then already gained some attention with his paintings. Van Doesburg
saw in these paintings his ideal in painting: a complete abstraction of
reality. Soon after the exposition Van Doesburg got in contact with Mondrian,
and together with related artists Bart van der Leck, Anthony Kok, Vilmos
Huszar and J.J.P. Oud they founded the magazine De Stijl in 1917.

### [edit] Promoting De Stijl

Although 'De Stijl' was made up of many members, Van Doesburg was the
'ambassador' of the movement, promoting it across Europe. He moved to Weimar
in 1922, deciding to make an impression on the Bauhaus principal, Walter
Gropius, in order to spread the influence of the movement.

While Gropius accepted many of the precepts of contemporary art movements he
did not feel that Doesburg should become a Bauhaus master. Doesburg then
installed himself near to the Bauhaus buildings and started to attract school
students interested in the new ideas of Constructivism. Dadaism, and De Stijl.

### [edit] The split with Mondrian

The friendship between Van Doesburg and Mondrian remained strong in these
years, although their primary way of communication was by letter. In 1923 Van
Doesburg moved to Paris together with his later wife Nelly van Moorsel.
Because the two men got to see each other on a much more regular basis the
differences in character became apparent: Mondrian was an introvert, while van
Doesburg was more flamboyant and extravagant. During 1924 the two men had
disagreements, which eventually led to a (temporary) split in the same year.
The exact reason for this split has been a point of contention among art
historians; usually the divergent ideas about the directions of the lines in
the paintings have been named as the primary reason: Mondrian never accepted
diagonals, whereas Doesburg insisted on the diagonal's dynamic aspects, and
indeed featured it in his art. Mondrian accepted some concepts of diagonals,
such as in his "Lozenge" paintings, where the canvas was rotated 45 degrees,
while still maintaining horizontal lines. In recent years, however, this
theory gained critique from art historians such as Carel Blotkamp, who cites
their different concepts about space and time as the main reason for the
split. After the split, Van Doesburg launched a new concept for his art,
Elementarism, which was characterized by the diagonal lines and rivaled with
Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism.

In 1929 the two men reconciled when they accidentally met in a cafÃ© in Paris.

XXII (1922)

Van Doesburg had other activities apart from painting and promoting De Stijl:
he made efforts in architecture, designing houses for artists, together with
Georges Vantongerloo and he designed the decoration for the CafÃ© Aubette in
Strasbourg. Together with El Lissitzky and Kurt Schwitters, Van Doesburg
pioneered the efforts to an International of Arts in two congresses held in
DÃ¼sseldorf and Weimar, in 1922. A geometrically constructed alphabet Van
Doesburg designed in 1919 has been revived in digital form as Architype Van
Doesburg. This typeface anticipates similar later experimentation by Kurt
Schwitters in his typeface Architype Schwitters.

Van Doesburg also kept a link with DADA, publishing the magazine MÃ©cano under
the heteronym of I. K. Bonset (possibly an anagram of "Ik ben zot", Dutch for
"I am foolish"). He also published Dada poetry under the same name in De
Stijl. Under a second pseudonym, Aldo Camini, he published anti-philosophical
prose, inspired by the Italian representative of Metaphysical art, Carlo CarrÃ
. In these works of literature, he heavily opposed individualism (and thus
against the movement of the Tachtigers, realism, and psychological thinking.
He sought for a collective experience of reality. His conception of intensity
had much in common with Paul van Ostaijen's conception of "dynamiek". He
wanted to strip words of their former meaning, and give them a new meaning and
power of expression. By doing this, he tried to evoke a new reality, instead
of describing it.

### [edit] Last years

Van Doesburg stayed active in art groups such as Cercle et CarrÃ©, Art Concret
and Abstraction-CrÃ©ation, which he founded in 1931. At the end of February
1931 he was forced to move to Davos in Switzerland because of his declining
health. Van Doesburg did not recuperate: on 7 March 1931 he died of a heart
attack. After his death Nelly van Doesburg released the last issue of De Stijl
as a memorial issue with contributions by old and new members from De Stijl.
