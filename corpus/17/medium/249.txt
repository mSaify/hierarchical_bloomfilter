An example of Calibri Regular, Bold and Italic

Calibri is a humanist sans-serif typeface family under the Microsoft ClearType
Font Collection.

In Microsoft Office 2007, it replaced Times New Roman as the default typeface
in Word[1] and replaced Arial as the default in PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook.

Calibri was designed by Lucas de Groot for Microsoft to take advantage of
Microsoft's ClearType rendering technology.

## [edit] Characteristics

The subtle rounded stems and corners, which are visible at larger sizes,
create a warm and soft character. The typeface includes characters from Latin,
Latin extended, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts. OpenType features include small
caps, subscripts and superscripts, and extra ligatures.

As with other sans-serif ClearType Collection fonts, it includes unique italic
type features, which are common in modern typefaces.

## [edit] Availability

The typeface is distributed with Windows Vista, Microsoft Office 2007, and
Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac. It can also be separately downloaded from
Microsoft.

The typeface â along with Candara, Consolas, Cambria, Constantia, and Corbel
â is also distributed with the free Powerpoint 2007 Viewer[2] and the
Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.[3]

The retail version of the typeface is sold by Ascender Corporation, as well as
by Monotype Imaging in MicroType format as part of the Vista 8 Font Set
package.

## [edit] Awards

Calibri won the TDC2 2005 award under the Type System category.[4]
