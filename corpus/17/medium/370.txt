## [edit] Family and education

Nouvel was born August 12, 1945 in Fumel, Lot-et-Garonne, France, the son of
RenÃ©e and Roger Nouvel who were teachers. His family moved often when his
father became the county's chief school superintendent. His parents encouraged
Nouvel to study mathematics and language, but when he was 16 years old he was
captivated by art when a teacher taught him drawing. Although his later said
he thought that his parents were guiding him to pursue a career in education
or engineering, the family reached a compromise that he could study
architecture which they thought was less risky than art.[4]

When Nouvel failed an entrance examination at the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts of
Bordeaux, he moved to Paris where he won first prize in a national competition
to attend the Ãcole nationale supÃ©rieure des Beaux-Arts. From 1967 to 1970,
Nouvel earned his income as an assistant to architects Claude Parent and Paul
Virilio, who after only one year, made him a project manager in charge of
building an large apartment complex.[4]

Nouvel and filmmaker Odile Fillion married and have two sons, Bertrand, who is
a post-doctorate computer scientist working at the University of Chiba in
Japan, and Pierre, who is a theater producer and designer at his company,
Factoid. With his second wife Catherine Richard, Nouvel has a daughter, Sarah.
He lives now with Mia HÃ¤gg, who is a Swedish architect working at her
practice Habiter Autrement (HA) in Paris.[4]

## [edit] Practice

By age 25, Nouvel completed school and entered into his own partnership with
FranÃ§ois Seigneur. Parent sent them work, and gave Nouvel a valuable
recommendation to the directorship of the seventh edition of the Biennale de
Paris[5] where for fifteen years, Nouvel designed exhibits and made contacts
in the arts and theater.[4] Soon into his career, Nouvel became a key
participant in intellectual debates about architecture in France: he co-
founded the Mars 1976 movement in 1976 and, a year later, the Syndicat de
l'Architecture. Nouvel was one of the organizers of the competition for the
rejuvenation of the Les Halles district (1977) and he founded the first Paris
architecture biennale in 1980.

In 1981, Nouvel won the competition for the Institut du monde arabe (Arab
World Institute) building in Paris, whose construction was completed in 1987
and brought Nouvel international fame. Mechanical lenses reminiscent of Arabic
latticework in its south wall open and shut automatically, controlling
interior lighting as the lenses' photoelectric cells respond to exterior light
levels.[4]

Nouvel had three different partners between 1972 and 1984: Gilbert Lezenes,
Jean-FranÃ§ois Guyot, and Pierre Soria. In 1985 with his junior architects
Emmanuel Blamont, Jean-Marc Ibos and Mirto Vitart, he founded Jean Nouvel et
AssociÃ©s. Then, with Emmanuel Gattani, he formed JNEC in 1988. Ateliers Jean
Nouvel, his present practice, was formed in 1994 with Michel PÃ©lissiÃ© and is
one of the largest in France, with 140 people in the main office in Paris.
Ateliers Jean Nouvel site offices are in London, Copenhagen, New York, Rome,
Madrid and Barcelona. As of 2008, they are working on 40 active projects in 13
countries.[4] Nouvel designed a flacon for L'Homme, an Yves Saint Laurent
fragrance, in a limited edition launched in 2008.[7]

## [edit] Pritzker Prize

<IMG>

<IMG>

Torre Agbar (2005, upper right) in Barcelona is one of Nouvel's most famous
recent buildings.

Nouvel was awarded the Pritzker Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2008,
for his work on more than 200 projects,[8] among them, in the words of The New
York Times, the "exotically louvered" Arab World Institute, the bullet-shaped
and "candy-colored" Torre Agbar in Barcelona, the "muscular" Guthrie Theater
with its cantilevered bridge in Minneapolis, and in Paris, the "defiant,
mysterious and wildly eccentric" MusÃ©e du quai Branly (2006) and the
Philharmonie de Paris (a "trip into the unknown" c. 2012).[3][8]

Pritzker points to several more major works: in Europe, the Cartier Foundation
for Contemporary Art (1994), the Culture and Convention Center (KKL, 2000) in
Lucerne, the OpÃ©ra Nouvel (2003) in Lyon, Expo 2002 in Switzerland and, under
construction, the Copenhagen Concert Hall and the courthouse in Nantes (2000);
and two tall towers in planning in North America, Tour Verre in New York City
and SunCal in Los Angeles,[4]

In its citation, the jury of the Pritzker prize noted:

> Of the many phrases that might be used to describe the career of architect
Jean Nouvel, foremost are those that emphasize his courageous pursuit of new
ideas and his challenge of accepted norms in order to stretch the boundaries
of the field. [...] The jury acknowledged the âpersistence, imagination,
exuberance, and, above all, an insatiable urge for creative experimentationâ
as qualities abundant in Nouvelâs work.[4]

Nouvel is the second French citizen to win the Pritzker Prize,[9] after
Christian de Portzamparc in 1994.

## [edit] Projects

Nouvel has designed a number of notable buildings across the world, the most
significant of which are listed below. As part of the announcement of Nouvel's
Pritzker Prize, the Hyatt Foundation, which awards the prize, published a full
illustrated list of Nouvel's architectural work, including projects which were
never built, projects in construction and designs for which construction has
yet to start. [10][11] In 2001 director Beat Kuert filmed a documentary about
five of Nouvel's projects titled Jean Nouvel.

### [edit] Proposed

  * Jean Nouvel is one of the architects involved in the designing of the new Slussen in Stockholm.[12]
  * On Tuesday 05/27/2008 Nouvel's design won the contest for the upcoming Tour Signal in La DÃ©fense.
  * In February 2008, Nouvel agreed to design a rakish 45-story luxury condo tower in upscale Century City section of Los Angeles, California. The tower will be of modern design -- it is designed to maximize views of the Los Angeles Country Club from the units and is opposed by both homeowners associations in Beverly Hills for the shadows it will cast on many small homes and its next door neighbor, Beverly Hills High School. [13]
  * In November 2006, Hines commissioned Nouvel to build a new 75-story tower, named the Tour de Verre, next to the Museum of Modern Art in Midtown Manhattan. The tower will house a hotel, luxury apartments and three floors (2nd, 4th, and 5th) will be used by MoMA to expand its exhibition space.[14] The tower has ignited a controversy in New York City, with many objecting to the tower, and Community Board 5 has rejected the project.[15]
  * In April 2007, Jean Nouvel associated with Marshall Day Acoustics Ltd won the competition to build a new Orchestra Hall (Philharmonie de Paris) in Paris, close to CitÃ© de la Musique (opening in 2012)[16]
  * The Centre for Sustainable Development in Le Havre, France. The project includes the construction of a 120 m high tower on a former seaport area. The project is currently on hold because of an important increase in projected costs. [17]

### [edit] Under construction

Model of the future Louvre Abu Dhabi

  * In March 2007, the Louvre announced it would build a Louvre branch in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, on Saadiyat Island. Jean Nouvel was chosen as architect. The museum is expected to be completed by 2012. [18]
  * A 20-story condo tower built on a parking lot at 11th Avenue and 19th Street in New York City. The tower is next to the Venus (mural) (1970) by New York painter Knox Martin[1] on the south side of Bayview Correctional Facility and will block the 10 story mural from view.[19] (Expected completion in 2009)[20]
  * In Montpellier the new HÃ´tel de Ville designed in partnership with FranÃ§ois FontÃ¨s is under construction and scheduled for completion in 2011. [21]

### [edit] Abandoned projects

  * 1989 - The Tour Sans Fins (Office/High-Rise) at La DÃ©fense, France, was never realized. Nouvel's winning design, proposed as Europe's tallest building in 1989, was to change ground up from granite, followed by aluminum, stainless steel and finally glassâ"increasingly diaphanous before disappearing into the sky".[4]

## [edit] Awards and distinctions

Nouvel and the buildings which he designed have received a number of
distinctions during his career, the most prestigious of which are listed
