Tapas (IPA: [ËtapËas]) is the name of a wide variety of appetizers in
Spanish cuisine. They may be cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or warm
(such as puntillitas, which are battered, fried baby squid).

In North America and the United Kingdom, tapas have evolved into an entire
cuisine. In these countries, patrons of tapas restaurants can order many
different tapas and combine them to make a full meal.

The serving of tapas is designed to encourage conversation because people are
not so focused upon eating an entire meal that is set before them. Also, in
some countries it is customary for diners to stand and move about while eating
tapas.

## [edit] History

According to legend[citation needed], the tapa tradition began when Castile's
King, Alfonso X of Castile or Alfonso the Wise, recovered from an illness by
drinking wine mixed with small dishes between meals. After regaining his
health, the king ordered that taverns were not allowed to serve wine to
customers unless the beverage was accompanied by a small snack or tapas. The
word became a kind of loophole in the law to allow drinkers to imbibe alcohol.

According to The Joy of Cooking, the original tapas were the slices of bread
or meat which sherry drinkers in Andalusian taverns used to cover their
glasses between sips. This was a practical measure meant to prevent fruit
flies from hovering over the sweet sherry. The meat used to cover the sherry
was normally ham or chorizo, which are both very salty and activate thirst.
Because of this, bartenders and restaurant owners began creating a variety of
snacks to serve with sherry, thus increasing their alcohol sales.[1] Soon the
lowly tapa (from tapa derived the verb tapar, "to cover") became as important
as the sherry.

Tapas evolved over Spain's history through the incorporation of ingredients
and influences from many different cultures and countries. The east coast was
invaded by the Romans, who introduced the olive and irrigation methods. The
invasion of the North African Moors in the 8th century also brought olives to
the south, as well as almonds, citrus fruits and fragrant spices. The
influence of their 700-year presence remains today, especially in Andalusia.
The discovery of the New World brought the introduction of tomatoes, sweet and
chili peppers, maize (corn), beans and potatoes. These were readily accepted
and easily grown in Spain's micro-climates.

## [edit] Etymology

Tapa means "lid" or "cover" in Spanish. There are several explanations for the
etymology of "tapa":

  * A commonly cited explanation is that an item, be it bread or a flat card, etc., would often be placed on top of a drink to protect it from fruit flies; at some point it became a habit to top this "cover" with a snack.
  * It is also commonly said that since one would be standing while eating a tapa in traditional Spanish bars, they would need to place their plates on top of their drinks in order to eat, making it a top.
  * Some believe that the name originated sometime around the 16th century when tavern owners from Castilla-La Mancha found out that the strong taste and smell of mature cheese could help disguise that of bad wine, thus "covering" it, and started offering free cheese when serving cheap wine.
  * Another popular explanation says that the king Alfonso XII stopped by a famous venta (inn) in CÃ¡diz (Andalusian city) where he ordered a cup of sherry. The waiter covered the glass with a slice of cured ham before offering it to the king, to protect the wine from the beach sand, as CÃ¡diz is a windy place. The king, after drinking his wine and eating the tapa, ordered another sherry "with the cover"

## [edit] Tapas in Spain

In Spain,[2] dinner is usually served between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. (sometimes as
late as 12 midnight), leaving significant time between work and dinner.
Therefore, Spaniards often go "bar hopping" (Spanish: Ir de tapas) and eat
tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner. Since lunch is
usually served between 1 and 3 p.m., another common time for tapas is weekend
days around noon as a means of socializing before lunch proper at home.

It is very common for a bar or a small local restaurant to have 8 to 12
different kinds of tapas in warming trays with glass partitions covering the
food. They are often very strongly flavored with garlic, chilies or paprika,
cumin, salt, pepper, saffron and sometimes in plentiful amounts of olive oil.
Often one or more of the choices is seafood (mariscos), often including
anchovies, sardines or mackerel in olive oil, squid or others in a tomato
based sauce, sometimes with the addition of red or green peppers or other
seasoning. It is rare to see a tapas selection not include one or more types
of olives, such as manzanilla or arbequina olives. One or more types of bread
are usually available to eat with any of the sauce-based tapas.

In Madrid, LeÃ³n, Asturias, Extremadura, and in parts of Andalucia, when you
go to a bar and order a drink, you will often get a tapa for free. In LeÃ³n, a
city in northwest Spain, an entire zone known as the Barrio Humedo is
dedicated to tapas bars each serving their own unique dish served free with a
corto (small beer) or glass of wine. Sometimes, especially in Northern Spain,
they're also called pinchos (spelled pintxos in Basque) in Navarre, the Basque
Country, Cantabria and in some provinces like Salamanca. They're called that
because many of them have a pincho or toothpick through them. The toothpick is
used to keep whatever the snack is made of from falling off the slice of bread
it is attached to and to keep track of the number of tapas the customer has
eaten. Differently priced tapas have different shape or size toothpicks. Tapa
price ranges from 1.00 to 1.50 euros. Another name for them is banderillas
(diminutive of bandera "flag"), in part because some of them resemble the
colorful spears used in bullfighting.

In Andalusia, tapas can be "upgraded" to bigger portions, equivalent to half a
dish (media raciÃ³n) or a whole one (raciÃ³n). This is generally more
economical when a tapa is being ordered by more than one person. The portions
are usually shared by diners, and a meal made up of raciones resembles a
Middle Eastern mezze or Chinese dim sum.

## [edit] Tapas in North America and the United Kingdom

Upscale tapas restaurants and tapas bars are common in many cities of the
United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. In these establishments, a
selection of tapas is typically served as a main course. As with any cuisine
exported from its original country, there can be significant differences
between the original Spanish dishes and the dishes as they are served abroad.

## [edit] Tapas in the Philippines

The concept of Spanish tapas â eating little plates of food with alcoholic
beverages â has a long tradition in the Philippines. But tapa in the
Philippines has little resemblance to the original Spanish meaning of the
word. Rather, it is a traditional dish of salt-cured beef that is similar to
American-style beef jerky.

Filipino tapa (mostly made with beef, occasionally with venison or wild boar)
is fried and eaten as a full meal, usually for breakfast with garlic-fried
rice and fried eggs, along with a chili-vinegar dip.

Beef tapa may also be crisp-fried and served as a proper Spanish-style tapas
with alcoholic drinks in Filipino bars and restaurants. There is also a sweet
variant of tapa, with the sugar added last so as to avoid a burnt taste.
Another variant is the sarciado-type (wet), which has strips of beef cooked in
water, vinegar, and soy sauce and flavored with calamansi, garlic, and sugar

## [edit] Venetian Cicchetti

Cicchetti refers to small tapas-like dishes that are served in ciccetti bars
in Venice. Typically, Venetians eat cicchetti during the day, for lunch or
late afternoon snacks.
