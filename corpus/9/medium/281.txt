A market economy is an economic system based on the division of labor in which
the prices of goods and services are determined in a free price system set by
supply and demand.[1] This is often contrasted with a planned economy, in
which a central government determines the price of goods and services using a
fixed price system. Market economies are contrasted with mixed economy where
the price system is not entirely free but under some government control that
is not extensive enough to constitute a planned economy. In the real world,
market economies do not exist in pure form, as societies and governments
regulate them to varying degrees rather than allow self-regulation by market
forces.[2][3] The term free-market economy is sometimes used synonymously with
market economy,[4] but, as Ludwig Erhard once pointed out, this does not
preclude an economy from having socialist attributes opposed to a laissez-
faire system.[5] Economist Ludwig von Mises also pointed out that a market
economy is still a market economy even if the government intervenes in
pricing.[6]

Different perspectives exist as to how strong a role the government should
have in both guiding the economy and addressing the inequalities the market
produces. For example, there is no universal agreement on issues such as
central banking, and welfare. However, most economists oppose protectionist
tariffs.[7]

The term market economy is not identical to capitalism where a corporation
hires workers as a labour commodity to produce material wealth and boost
shareholder profits.[8] Market mechanisms have been utilized in a handful of
socialist states, such as Yugoslavia and even Cuba to a very limited extent.
The People's Republic of China is run by the Communist Party, but its economy
involves considerable private enterprise and market forces in both private and
public sectors. It is also possible to envision an economic system based on
independent producers, cooperative, democratic worker ownership and market
allocation of final goods and services; the labour-managed market economy is
one of several proposed forms of market socialism.[9]

## [edit] Systems based on a market economy

Although no country has ever had within its border an economy in which all
markets were absolutely free, the term typically is not used in an absolute
sense. Many states which are said to have a market economy have a high level
of market freedom, even if it is less than some parts of the population would
prefer. Thus, almost all economies in the world today are mixed economies with
varying degrees of free market and planned economy traits. For example, in the
United States there are more market economy traits than in the Western
European countries.[10]

### [edit] Capitalism (Liberal Market)

Main article: Capitalism

Capitalism generally refers to an economic system in which the means of
production are all or mostly privately owned and operated for profit, and in
which investments, distribution, income, production and pricing of goods and
services are determined through the operation of a market economy. It is
usually considered to involve the right of individuals and groups of
individuals acting as "legal persons" or corporations to trade capital goods,
labor, land and money. Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since
the end of feudalism, but most feel that the term "mixed economies" more
precisely describes most contemporary economies, due to their containing both
private-owned and state-owned enterprises, combining elements of capitalism
and socialism, or mixing the characteristics of market economies and planned
economies. In capitalism,there is no central planning authority but the prices
are decided by the demand-supply scale. For example, higher demand for certain
goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods
lead to lower prices.

### [edit] Laissez-Faire

Main article: Laissez-faire

Laissez-faire is synonymous with what was referred to as strict capitalist
free market economy during the early and mid-19th century as an ideal to
achieve. It is generally understood that the necessary components for the
functioning of an idealized free market include the complete absence of
government regulation, subsidies, artificial price pressures and government-
granted monopolies (usually classified as coercive monopoly by free market
advocates) and no taxes or tariffs other than what is necessary for the
government to provide protection from coercion and theft and maintaining
peace, and property rights.

### [edit] Anarcho-Capitalism

Main article: Anarcho-capitalism

Anarcho-capitalism, market anarchism or individualist anarchism advocates a
true free market like laissez-faire and in addition the complete elimination
of the state apparatus; the provision of law enforcement, courts, national
defense, and all other security services by voluntarily-funded competitors in
a free market rather than through compulsory taxation; the complete
deregulation of nonintrusive personal and economic activities; and a self-
regulated market. Anarcho-capitalists argue for a society based in voluntary
trade of private property (including money, consumer goods, land, and capital
goods) and services in order to maximize individual liberty and prosperity.

### [edit] Market Socialism

Main article: Market socialism

Market socialism refers to various economic systems in which the government
owns the economic institutions or major industries but operates them according
to the rules of supply and demand. In a traditional market socialist economy,
prices would be determined by a government planning ministry, and enterprises
would either be state-owned or cooperatively-owned and managed by their
employees. Libertarian socialists and left-anarchists often promote a form of
market socialism in which enterprises are owned and managed collectively by
the workers, but compete with each other in the same way private companies
compete in a capitalist market. The People's Republic of China currently has a
form of market socialism referred to as the socialist market economy, in which
most of the industry is state-owned, but prices are not set by the government.
Within this model, the state-owned enterprises are free from excessive
regulation and function more autonomously in a more decentralized fashion than
in other socialist economic systems.

### [edit] Social Market

Main article: Social Market Economy

The social market economic model is based upon the free market economy,
combined with regulative measures from the state.[11] The theoretical
fundament is build on the neoliberalism (in Germany also called
ordoliberalism).[12] This model was implemented by Ludwig Erhard after World
War II in West Germany. Characteristics of social market economies are a
strong competition policy and a contractionary monetary policy.

## [edit] Theory

Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek stated that economic freedom is a
necessary condition for the creation and sustainability of civil and political
freedoms. They believed that this economic freedom can only be achieved in a
market-oriented economy, specifically a free market economy. They do believe,
however, that sufficient economic freedom can be achieved in economies with
functioning markets through price mechanisms and private property rights. They
believe that the more economic freedom that is available the more civil and
political freedoms a society will enjoy.

Friedman states:

  * "Economic freedom is simply a requisite for political freedom. By enabling people to cooperate with one another without coercion or central direction it reduces the area over which political power is exercised"Friedman, Milton and Rose Friedman, Free to Choose: A Personal Statement, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980, p. 2-3
  * "Capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom" Capitalism and freedom

Studies by the Canadian free market-oriented Fraser Institute, the American
free market-oriented Heritage Foundation, and the Wall Street Journal state
that there is a relationship between economic freedom and political and civil
freedoms to the extent claimed by Friedrich von Hayek. They agree with Hayek
that those countries which restrict economic freedom ultimately restrict civil
and political freedoms.[13][14]

Generally market economies are bottom-up in decision-making as consumers
convey information to producers through prices paid in market transactions.
All states today have some form of control over the market that removes the
free and unrestricted direction of resources from consumers and prices such as
tariffs and corporate subsidies. Milton Friedman and many other
microeconomists believe that these forms of intervention provide incentives
for resources to be misused and wasted, producing products society may not
value as much as a product that is valued as a result of these restrictions.

## [edit] Criticism

Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert claim that markets inherently produce class
division; divisions between conceptual and manual laborers, and ultimately
managers and workers, and a de facto labor market for conceptual workers.
Albert says that in a market economy, even if everyone started out with a
balanced job complex (doing a mix of roles of varying creativity,
responsibility and empowerment), class divisions would arise, as some workers
will be more able than others to capture the benefits of economic gain: if one
worker designs cars and another builds them, the designer will use his
cognitive skills more frequently than the builder. In the long term, the
designer will become more adept at conceptual work than the builder, giving
the designer greater bargaining power in a firm over the distribution of
income. A conceptual worker who is not satisfied with his income can threaten
to work for a company that will pay him more, thus class divisions arise.[15]
