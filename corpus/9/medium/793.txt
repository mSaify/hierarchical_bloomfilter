DVD-Audio (commonly abbreviated as DVD-A) is a digital format for delivering
very high-fidelity audio content on a DVD. DVD-Audio is not intended to be a
video delivery format and should not be confused with video DVDs containing
concerts and music videos. The first discs entered the marketplace in 2000.
Future occasional DVD-Audio releases are expected and/or have been announced.
DVD-Audio is in a format war with Super Audio CD (SACD), another format for
delivering high-fidelity audio content. Neither has gained a strong position
in the marketplace. As media players that can play both DVD-Audio and SACD
(and many other formats) are available, both are likely to co-exist.

## [edit] Audio specifications

DVD-Audio offers many possible configurations of audio channels, ranging from
single-channel mono to 5.1-channel surround sound, at various sampling
frequencies and sample rates.[1] (The ".1" denotes a Low-frequency effects
channel (LFE) for bass and/or special audio effects.)

Compared to the compact disc, the much higher capacity DVD format enables the
inclusion of either:

  * Considerably more music (with respect to total running time and quantity of songs) or
  * Far higher audio quality, reflected by higher linear sampling rates and higher bit-per-sample resolution, and/or
  * Additional channels for spatial sound reproduction.

Audio on a DVD-Audio disc can be stored in many different bit-rate/sampling
rate/channel combinations:

16-, 20- or 24-bit  
44.1 kHz 48 kHz 88.2 kHz 96 kHz 176.4 kHz 192 kHz  
Mono (1.0) Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  
Stereo (2.0) Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes  
Stereo (2.1) Yes Yes Yes Yes No No  
Stereo + mono surround (3.0 or 3.1) Yes Yes Yes Yes No No  
Quad (4.0 or 4.1) Yes Yes Yes Yes No No  
3-stereo (3.0 or 3.1) Yes Yes Yes Yes No No  
3-stereo + mono surround (4.0 or 4.1) Yes Yes Yes Yes No No

Different bit-rate/sampling rate/channel combinations can be used on a single
disc. For instance, a DVD-Audio disc may contain a 96 kHz/24-bit 5.1-channel
audio track as well as a 192 kHz/24-bit stereo audio track. Also, the channels
of a track can be split into two groups stored at different resolutions. For
example, the front speakers could be 96/24, while the surrounds are 48/20.

Audio is stored on the disc in Linear PCM format, which is either uncompressed
or losslessly compressed with Meridian Lossless Packing. The maximum
permissible total bitrate is 9.6 Megabits per second. Channel/resolution
combinations that would exceed this need to be compressed. In uncompressed
modes, it is possible to get up to 96/16 or 48/24 in 5.1, and 192/24 in
stereo. To store 5.1 tracks in 88.2/20, 88.2/24, 96/20 or 96/24 MLP encoding
is mandatory.

The LFE channel is actually full range, and can be recorded at the same
resolution as the other channels. This permits it to be used instead as an
extra main channel, for example as a "height" speaker above the listening
position; this has been done on some releases. Such usage is non-standard, and
will often require special set-up by the end user.

If no native stereo audio exists on the disc, the DVD-Audio player may be able
to downmix the 5.1-channel audio to two-channel stereo audio if the listener
does not have a surround sound setup (provided that the coefficients were set
in the stream at authoring). Downmixing can only be done to two-channel
stereo, not to other configurations, such as 4.0 quad. DVD-Audio may also
feature menus, text subtitles, still images and video, plus in high end
authoring systems it is also possible to link directly into a Video_TS folder
that might contain video tracks, as well as PCM stereo and other "bonus"
features..

## [edit] Player compatibility

With the introduction of the DVD-Audio format, some kind of backward
compatibility with existing DVD-Video players was desired, although not
required. To address this, most DVD-Audio discs also contain DVD-Video
compatible data that allows the standard DVD-Video Dolby Digital 5.1-channel
audio track on the disc[2] (which can be downmixed to two channels for
listeners with no surround sound setup). Some discs also include a native
Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo, and even a DTS 96/24 5.1-channel, audio track.[3]

Because the DVD-Audio format is a member of the DVD family, a single disc can
have multiple layers and even two sides that contain media. A common
configuration includes a "DVD-Video" zone on a DVD-Audio formatted single
sided disc. The high-resolution, multichannel audio losslessly encoded using
MLP is only playable on DVD-Audio hardware but the DVD-Video zone, which can
contain Dolby or DTS 5.1 mixes and even video makes the disc compatible with
all DVD players. Other configurations include double layer DVDs (DVD-9) and
two-sided discs (DVD-10, DVD-14 or DVD-18). Some labels are releasing DVD
titles that are formatted as DVD-Audio on one side and DVD-Video on the other,
the DualDisc being one such example.

[4]ELS Surround is one of the few vehicle audio systems which can play DVD-A.

## [edit] Preamplifier/Surround Processor interface

In order to play DVD-Audio, a preamplifier or surround controller with six
analog inputs was originally required.[5] Whereas DVD-Video audio formats such
as Dolby Digital and DTS can be sent via the player's digital output to a
receiver for conversion to analog form and distribution to speakers, DVD-Audio
is not allowed to be delivered via unencrypted digital audio link at sample
rates higher than 48 kHz (i.e., ordinary DVD-Video quality) due to concerns
about digital copying.[5]

However encrypted digital formats have now been approved by the DVD Forum, the
first of which was Meridian Audio's MHR (Meridian High Resolution). The High
Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI 1.1) also allows encrypted digital audio
to be carried up to DVD-Audio specification (6 Ã 24-bit/96 kHz channels or 2
Ã 24-bit/192 kHz channels). The six channels of audio information can thus be
sent to the amplifier by several different methods:

  1. The 6 audio channels can be decrypted and extracted in the player and sent to the amplifier along 6 standard analog cables.
  2. The 6 audio channels can be decrypted and then re-encrypted into an HDMI or IEEE-1394 (Firewire) signal and sent to the amplifier, which will then decrypt the digital signal and then extract the 6 channels of audio. HDMI and IEEE-1394 encryption are different from the DVD-A encryption and were designed as a general standard for a high quality digital interface. The amplifier has to be equipped with a valid decryption key or it won't play the disk.
  3. The third option is via the S/PDIF (or TOSLINK) digital interface. However, because of concerns over unauthorized copying, DVD-A players are required to handle this digital interface in one of the following ways: 
    * Turn such an interface off completely. This option is preferred by the music publishers.
    * Downconvert the audio to a 2-channel 16-bit/48 kHz PCM signal. The music publishers are not enthusiastic about this because it permits the production of a CD-quality copy, something they still expect to sell, besides DVD-A.
    * Downconvert the audio to 2 channels, but keeping the original sample size and bit rate if the producer sets a flag on the DVD-A disc telling the player to do so.
  4. A final option is to modify the player, capturing the high resolution digital signals before they are fed to internal D/A converters and convert it to S/PDIF, giving full range digital (but only stereo) sound. There exist already do-it-yourself solutions for some players. There also exists an option to equip a DVD-A player with multiple S/PDIF outputs, for full resolution multichannel digital output. See: Six channel S/P-DIF output board.

## [edit] Sound quality

From a purely technical standpoint, the audio resolution of a DVD-Audio disc
can be substantially higher than standard red book CD audio. DVD-Audio
supports bit depths up to 24-bit and sample rates up to 192 kHz, while CD
audio is 16-bit, 44.1 kHz. In both cases, the source recording may have been
made at a much higher bit and sample rate, and down-converted for commercial
release.

It is uncertain whether average listeners can hear the difference between DVD-
Audio and CD-Audio, and many consumers do not regard any supposed quality
improvements offered as sufficient reason to justify purchasing new playback
equipment and repurchasing albums in higher-resolution formats. Many DVD-Audio
releases are older, standard definition audio recordings that have been
remixed in 5.1 and upsampled to DVD-Audio's higher resolution. However, the
fidelity of the upsampled audio will be limited by the source material quality
and may not exceed the quality of existing CD releases of the same albums.
When new recordings are made using high-resolution PCM encoding, a substantial
difference in fidelity can be achieved.[citation needed]

Three of the major music labels, Universal Music, EMI and Warner Bros. Records
and several smaller audiophile labels (such as AIX Records and DTS
Entertainment) have released or are continuing to release albums on DVD-Audio,
but the number is minimal compared to standard CDs. New high-definition titles
have been released in standard DVD-Video format (which can contain 2-channel
Linear PCM audio data ranging from 48 kHz/16-bit to 96 kHz/24-bit), "HDAD",
which includes a DVD-Video format recording on one side and DVD-Audio on the
other, CD/DVD packages, which can include the album on both CD and DVD-Audio,
or DualDisc, which can contain DVD-Audio content on the DVD side. In addition,
some titles that were initially released as a standalone DVD-Audio disc, such
as The Grateful Dead's American Beauty and R.E.M.'s Automatic for the People,
were re-released as a CD/DVD package or as a DualDisc.

## [edit] Copy protection

DVD-Audio discs may optionally employ a copy protection mechanism called
Content Protection for Prerecorded Media (CPPM).[6] CPPM, managed by the 4C
Entity, prevents users from extracting audio to computers and portable media
players.

Because DVD-Video's content-scrambling system (CSS) was quickly broken, DVD-
Audio's developers sought a better method of blocking unauthorized
duplications. They developed CPPM, which uses a media key block (MKB) to
authenticate DVD-Audio players. In order to decrypt the audio, players must
obtain a media key from the MKB, which also is encrypted. The player must use
its own unique key to decrypt the MKB. If a DVD-Audio player's decryption key
is compromised, that key can be rendered useless for decrypting future DVD-
Audio discs. DVD-Audio discs can also utilize digital watermarking technology
developed by the Verance Corporation, typically embedded into the audio once
every thirty seconds. If a DVD-Audio player encounters a watermark on a disc
without a valid MKB, it will halt playback.[7] The 4C Entity also developed a
similar specification, Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), which
is used on Secure Digital cards.

DVD-Audio's copy protection was overcome in 2005[7] by tools which allow data
to be decrypted or converted to 6 channel .WAV files without going through
lossy digital-to-analog conversion. Previously that conversion had required
expensive equipment to retain all 6 channels of audio rather than having it
downmixed to stereo. In the digital method, the decryption is done by a
commercial software player which has been patched to allow access to the
unprotected audio.

In 2007 the encryption scheme was overcome with a tool called dvdcpxm. In 12
February 2008 a program called DVD-Audio Explorer 2008 was released,
containing aforementioned libdvdcpxm coupled with an open source MLP
decoder.[8]

Like DVD-Video decryption, such tools may be illegal to use in the United
States under the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act. While the
Recording Industry Association of America has been successful in keeping these
tools off websites, they are still distributed on P2P file sharing networks
and newsgroups,[9] Additionally, in 2007 the widely-used commercial software
DVDFab Platinum added DVD-Audio decryption, allowing users to backup a full
DVD-A image to ISO.[10]

## [edit] DVD-Audio authoring software

Normal DVD(Video) authoring software usually does not support DVD-Audio
creation, so there is some special software:

### [edit] Macintosh

  * Sonic Solutions DVD Creator AV â The first DVD-Audio authoring solution available. A spin off of the popular high end DVD Video authoring package. It allows DVD-Audio authoring at the command line level only. Still widely used but no longer sold or supported by Sonic Solutions.
