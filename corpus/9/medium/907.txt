Money is anything that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services
and repayment of debts.[1] The main uses of money are as a medium of exchange,
a unit of account, and a store of value.[2] Some authors explicitly require
money to be a standard of deferred payment.[3] The dominant form of money is
currency[counterfactual].[4][5]

The term "price system" is sometimes used to refer to methods using commodity
valuation or money accounting systems.

The word "money" is believed to originate from a temple of Hera, located on
Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the ancient world Hera was often
associated with money. The temple of Juno Moneta at Rome was the place where
the mint of Ancient Rome was located.[6]. The name "Juno" may derive from the
Etruscan goddess Uni (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union",
"united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or
instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).

## Economic characteristics

Money is generally considered to have the following characteristics, which are
summed up in a rhyme found in older economics textbooks: "Money is a matter of
functions four, a medium, a measure, a standard, a store." That is, money
functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a standard of deferred
payment, and a store of value.[2][7][8]

There have been many historical arguments regarding the combination of money's
functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit
is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is that the role
of money as a medium of exchange is in conflict with its role as a store of
value: its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending,
whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate.[8] Others
argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not
diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported
both across space and time.[9] 'Financial capital' is a more general and
inclusive term for all liquid instruments, whether or not they are a uniformly
recognized tender.

### Medium of exchange

Main article: Medium of exchange

Money is used as an intermediary for trade, in order to avoid the
inefficiencies of a barter system, which are sometimes referred to as the
'double coincidence of wants problem'. Such usage is termed a medium of
exchange.

### Unit of account

Main article: Unit of account

A unit of account is a standard numerical unit of measurement of the market
value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a "measure" or
"standard" of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a
necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that
involve debt.

  * Divisible into small units without destroying their value; precious metals can be coined from bars, or melted down into bars again.
  * Fungible: that is, one unit or piece must be perceived as equivalent to any other, which is why diamonds, works of art or real estate are not suitable as money.
  * A specific weight, or measure, or size to be verifiably countable. For instance, coins are often made with ridges around the edges, so that any removal of material from the coin (lowering its commodity value) will be easy to detect.

### Store of value

Main article: Store of value

To act as a store of value, a commodity, a form of money, or financial capital
must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved â and be
predictably useful when it is so retrieved. Fiat currency like paper or
electronic currency no longer backed by gold in most countries is not
considered by some economists to be a store of value.

## Market liquidity

Main article: Market liquidity

Liquidity describes how easily an item can be traded for another item, or into
the common currency within an economy. Money is the most liquid asset because
it is universally recognised and accepted as the common currency. In this way,
money gives consumers the freedom to trade goods and services easily without
having to barter.

Liquid financial instruments are easily tradable and have low transaction
costs. There should be no â or minimal â spread between the prices to buy
and sell the instrument being used as money.

## Types of money

In economics, money is a broad term that refers to any financial instrument
that can fulfill the functions of money (detailed above). Modern monetary
theory distinguishes among different types of monetary aggregates, using a
categorization system that focuses on the liquidity of the financial
instrument used as money.

### Commodity money

Main article: Commodity money

Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The
commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity.[10]
Examples of commodities that have been used as mediums of exchange include
gold, silver, copper, rice, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts,
shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, barley, etc. These items were
sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another,
in various commodity valuation or Price System economies. Use of commodity
money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and
automatic unit of account for the commodity which is being used as money.

### Representative money

Main article: Representative money

Representative money is money that consists of token coins, other physical
tokens such as certificates, and even non-physical "digital certificates"
(authenticated digital transactions) that can be reliably exchanged for a
fixed quantity of a commodity such as gold, silver or potentially water, oil
or food. Representative money thus stands in direct and fixed relation to the
commodity which backs it, while not itself being composed of that commodity.

### Credit money

Main article: Credit money

Credit money is any claim against a physical or legal person that can be used
for the purchase of goods and services.[10] Credit money differs from
commodity and fiat money in two ways: It is not payable on demand (although in
the case of fiat money, "demand payment" is a purely symbolic act since all
that can be demanded is other types of fiat currency) and there is some
element of risk that the real value upon fulfillment of the claim will not be
equal to real value expected at the time of purchase.[10]

This risk comes about in two ways and affects both buyer and seller.

First it is a claim and the claimant may default (not pay). High levels of
default have destructive supply side effects. If manufacturers and service
providers do not receive payment for the goods they produce, they will not
have the resources to buy the labor and materials needed to produce new goods
and services. This reduces supply, increases prices and raises unemployment,
possibly triggering a period of stagflation. In extreme cases, widespread
defaults can cause a lack of confidence in lending institutions and lead to
economic depression. For example, abuse of credit arrangements is considered
one of the significant causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s.[11]

The second source of risk is time. Credit money is a promise of future
payment. If the interest rate on the claim fails to compensate for the
combined impact of the inflation (or deflation) rate and the time value of
money, the seller will receive less real value than anticipated. If the
interest rate on the claim overcompensates, the buyer will pay more than
expected.

The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of money
creation by banks.

### Fiat money

Main article: Fiat money

Fiat money is any money whose value is determined by legal means. The terms
fiat currency and fiat money relate to types of currency or money whose
usefulness results not from any intrinsic value or guarantee that it can be
converted into gold or another currency, but instead from a government's order
(fiat) that it must be accepted as a means of payment.[12][13]

Fiat money is created when a type of credit money (typically notes from a
central bank, such as the Federal Reserve System in the U.S.) is declared by a
government act (fiat) to be acceptable and officially-recognized payment for
all debts, both public and private. Fiat money may thus be symbolic of a
commodity or a government promise, though not a completely specified amount of
either of these. Fiat money is thus not technically fungible or tradable
directly for fixed quantities of anything, except more of the same
government's fiat money. Fiat moneys usually trade against each other in value
in an international market, as with other goods. An exception to this is when
currencies are locked to each other, as explained below. Many but not all fiat
moneys are accepted on the international market as having value. Those that
are trade indirectly against any internationally available goods and
services.[10] Thus the number of U.S. dollars or Japanese yen which are
equivalent to each other, or to a gram of gold metal, are all market decisions
which change from moment to moment on a daily basis. Occasionally, a country
will peg the value of its fiat money to that of the fiat money of a larger
economy: for example the Belize dollar trades in fixed proportion (at 2:1) to
the U.S. dollar, so there is no floating value ratio of the two currencies.

Fiat money, if physically represented in the form of currency (paper or coins)
can be easily damaged or destroyed. However, here fiat money has an advantage
over representative or commodity money, in that the same laws that created the
money can also define rules for its replacement in case of damage or
destruction. For example, the U.S. government will replace mutilated federal
reserve notes (U.S. fiat money) if at least half of the physical note can be
reconstructed, or if it can be otherwise proven to have been destroyed.[14] By
contrast, commodity money which has been destroyed or lost is gone.

### Money supply

Main article: Money supply

The money supply is the amount of money within a specific economy available
for purchasing goods or services. The supply in the US is usually considered
as four escalating categories M0, M1, M2 and M3. The categories grow in size
with M3 representing all forms of money (including credit) and M0 being just
base money (coins, bills, and central bank deposits). M0 is also money that
can satisfy private banks' reserve requirements. In the US, the Federal
Reserve is responsible for controlling the money supply, while in the Euro
area the respective institution is the European Central Bank. Other central
banks with significant impact on global finances are the Bank of Japan,
People's Bank of China and the Bank of England.

When gold is used as money, the money supply can grow in either of two ways.
First, the money supply can increase as the amount of gold increases by new
gold mining at about 2% per year, but it can also increase more during periods
of gold rushes and discoveries, such as when Columbus discovered the new world
and brought gold back to Spain, or when gold was discovered in California in
1848. This kind of increase helps debtors, and causes inflation, as the value
of gold goes down. Second, the money supply can increase when the value of
gold goes up. This kind of increase in the value of gold helps savers and
creditors and is called deflation, where items for sale are less expensive in
terms of gold. Deflation was the more typical situation for over a century
when gold and credit money backed by gold were used as money in the US from
1792 to 1913.

### Monetary policy

Main article: Monetary policy

Monetary policy is the process by which a government, central bank, or
monetary authority manages the money supply to achieve specific goals. Usually
the goal of monetary policy is to accommodate economic growth in an
environment of stable prices. For example, it is clearly stated in the Federal
Reserve Act that the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee
should seek âto promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable
prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.â[15]

A failed monetary policy can have significant detrimental effects on an
economy and the society that depends on it. These include hyperinflation,
stagflation, recession, high unemployment, shortages of imported goods,
inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and the adoption
of a much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for
instance, after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Governments and central banks have taken both regulatory and free market
approaches to monetary policy. Some of the tools used to control the money
supply include:

  * changing the interest rate at which the government loans or borrows money
  * currency purchases or sales
  * increasing or lowering government borrowing
  * increasing or lowering government spending
  * manipulation of exchange rates
  * raising or lowering bank reserve requirements
  * regulation or prohibition of private currencies
  * taxation or tax breaks on imports or exports of capital into a country

For many years much of monetary policy was influenced by an economic theory
known as monetarism. Monetarism is an economic theory which argues that
management of the money supply should be the primary means of regulating
economic activity. The stability of the demand for money prior to the 1980s
was a key finding of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz[16] supported by the
work of David Laidler[17], and many others.

The nature of the demand for money changed during the 1980s owing to
technical, institutional, and legal factors and the influence of monetarism
has since decreased.

## History of money

Main article: History of money

The use of barter like methods may date back to at least 100,000 years ago.
Trading in red ochre is attested in Swaziland, shell jewellery in the form of
strung beads also dates back to this period, and had the basic attributes
needed of commodity money. To organize production and to distribute goods and
services among their populations, before market economies existed, people
relied on tradition, top-down command, or community cooperation.

The Shekel referred to an ancient unit of weight and currency. The first usage
of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. and referred to a specific
mass of barley which related other values in a metric such as silver, bronze,
copper etc. A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit
of weight.[18]

According to Herodotus, and most modern scholars, the Lydians were the first
people to introduce the use of gold and silver coin.[19] It is thought that
these first stamped coins were minted around 650-600 BC.[20] A stater coin was
made in the stater (trite) denomination. To complement the stater, fractions
were made: the trite (third), the hekte (sixth), and so forth in lower
denominations.

The name of Croesus of Lydia became synonymous with wealth in antiquity.
Sardis was renowned as a beautiful city. Around 550 BC, Croesus contributed
money for the construction of the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the
Seven Wonders of the ancient world.

The first banknotes were used in China in the 7th century, and the first in
Europe issued by Stockholms Banco in 1661.

In the Western world, a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie,
stemming from Latin in specie "in kind".[21]
