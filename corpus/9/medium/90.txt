### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

ETAOIN SHRDLU is the approximate order of frequency of the twelve most
commonly used letters in the English language, best known as a nonsense phrase
that sometimes appeared in print in the days of "hot type" publishing due to a
custom of Linotype machine operators.

## [edit] Linotype history

The letters on Linotype keyboards were arranged by letter frequency, so ETAOIN
SHRDLU were the first two vertical columns on the left side of the keyboard.
Linotype operators who had made a typing error could not easily go back to
delete it, and had to finish the line before they could eject the slug and re-
key a new one. Since the line with the error would be discarded and hence its
contents didn't matter, the quickest way to finish the line was to run a
finger down the keys, creating this nonsense phrase.

An occurrence of the sequence in The New York Times (15 February 1967).

A linotype keyboard. It has the following alphabet arrangement twice, once for
lower-case and once for upper-case letters, with extra keys for numbers and
symbols located between the two cases: :etaoin / shrdlu / cmfwyp / vbgkqj / xz

If the slug with the error made it as far as the compositors, the distinctive
set of letters served to quickly identify it for removal. Occasionally,
however, the phrase would be overlooked and get printed erroneously. This
happened often enough that the ETAOIN SHRDLU is listed in the Oxford English
Dictionary and in the Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.

It also became part of the lore of newspapers. A documentary about the last
issue of The New York Times to be composed in the hot-metal printing process
(2 July 1978) was entitled Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu.[1]

Operators could correct an assembled line of matrices in the assembler by
rearranging them by hand, or by picking out individual matrices ("mats") to
"delete" a character, temporarily placing the rejected mats in a tray attached
to the machine for this purpose. In the example on this page, the operator
wanted to return an "m," a spaceband and an "e" to the machine, so after
casting the final line of the story he placed the rejects in the empty
assembler, filled the line by running a finger down the keys (with a spaceband
between each line), added a few em spaces, and sent the line of mats through.
