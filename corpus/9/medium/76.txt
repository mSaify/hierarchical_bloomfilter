In sociolinguistics, a T-V distinction describes the situation wherein a
language has second-person pronouns that distinguish varying levels of
politeness, social distance, courtesy, familiarity, or insult toward the
addressee.

## [edit] History and usage

The expressions T-form and V-form were introduced by Brown and Gilman (1960),
with reference to the initial letters of these pronouns in Latin, tu and vos.
In Latin, tu was originally the singular, and vos the plural, with no
distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, usage of
the plural to the Roman emperor began in the fourth century AD. They mention
the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in
Constantinople and Rome), but also mention that "plurality is a very old and
ubiquitous metaphor for power". This usage was extended to other powerful
figures, such as Pope Gregory I (590-604). However, Brown and Gilman note that
it was only between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries that the norms for
the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural
may be extended to other persons, such as the "royal we" (majestic plural) in
English.

Brown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either
relationships of 'power' and/or 'solidarity', depending on the culture of the
speakers, showing that 'power' had been the dominant predictor of form in
Europe until the twentieth century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful
person to use a T-form but expect a V-form in return. However in the twentieth
century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use
T-forms with those they knew, and V-forms in service encounters, with
reciprocal usage being the norm in both cases.

Modern English has no T-V distinction. It can often be confusing for an
English speaker learning a language with a T-V distinction to assimilate the
rules surrounding when to call someone with the formal or the informal
pronoun. Students are often advised to err on the side of caution by using the
formal pronouns. However, this risks sounding snobbish or ridiculous.

Though English has no syntactic T-V distinction, there are semantic analogies,
such as whether to address someone by first name or last name (or using sir
and ma'am). However the boundaries between formal and informal language differ
from language to language, and most languages use formal speech more
frequently[citation needed], and/or in different circumstances than English.
In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name
and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German
teachers use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian
teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university
students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of
formality in T-V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers.
For example, the catchphrase of "Be careful, Michael" from Knight Rider was
usually dubbed "Seien Sie vorsichtig, Michael" in German, implying both
formality (use of Sie) and familiarity (use of first name).

The use of these forms calls for compensating translation of dialogue into
English. For example, a character in a French film or novel saying "Tutoie-
moi!" ("Use [the informal pronoun] tu when addressing me!") might be
translated "Do not be so formal!"

## [edit] Examples of T-V distinctions

In many languages, the formal singular pronoun derives from a plural form.
Many Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the Latin singular tu
and formal forms derived from Latin plural vos, sometimes via a circuitous
route. Sometimes, singular V-form derives from a third person pronoun. Some
languages have separate T and V forms for both singular and plural; others
have the same form; others have a T-V distinction only in the singular.

Different languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within
languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of
higher status tending both to use and to expect more formal language) and
between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, u is slowly
falling into disuse in the plural, and thus one could sometimes address a
group as jullie (which clearly expresses the plural) when one would address
each member individually as u (which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous).
In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred â having lost
vosotros, Latin Americans address all groups as ustedes, even if the group is
composed of friends whom they would call tÃº or vos (mostly in Argentina and
Uruguay). In Standard Peninsular Spanish, however, vosotros is still regularly
employed in familiar conversation. In some cases, V-forms are likely to be
capitalized when written.

Following is a table of singular and plural versions of the second person
plural and singular in many languages. Many of these do not demonstrate T-V
distinction in the above sense of the "you" plural being used for "you"
singular informal.

## [edit] Language-specific remarks

### [edit] Afrikaans

Modern Afrikaans rarely makes the distinction between the informal "jy" and
"jou" ("you" subject and "your" / "you" object) and the more formal "u" (or
"U" when addressing God), although sometimes it is upheld in a formal setting,
such as in politics, business or in a polite conversation. The trend is moving
towards using the informal pronoun most often.

### [edit] Arabic

Modern Standard Arabic does not have a T-V distinction, using Ø£ÙØª (anta,
male) and Ø£ÙØªÙ (anti, female) in the singular, Ø£ÙØªÙ Ø§ antumÄ (for
male and female) in the dual, and Ø£ÙØªÙ antum or Ø£ÙØªÙ antunna in the
plural. However, many spoken varieties of Arabic do make the distinction.
Notably, Egyptian Arabic uses Ø­Ø¶Ø±ØªÙ (á¸¥aá¸retak/á¸¥aá¸retik, meaning
"your grace") and variants as the formal pronoun, with anta as the informal
pronoun. In general, á¸¥aá¸retak is reserved for elder relatives,
authorities, bosses, and senior business partners.

### [edit] Basque

Basque has three levels of formality: hi, zu and berori.

The most neutral is zu, that is considered the formal one. The informal one is
hi and its use is limited to some specific situations: among friends, parents
to address their children (never otherwise, neither the spouses among them),
to children and to pets.

Unlike "zu", "hi" makes a distinction weather the addressed one is a male or a
female (for example: duk (you, male, have) and dun (you, female, have)); also
makes the speaker to change any other verb forms to mark this distinction
about the addressed one, even in 3rd and 1st person verbs. This is called
hitano (for example: du (s/he has, neutral form); dik (s/he has, male you) and
din (s/he has, female you)).

The third form, berori, is a very and strong formal pronoun hardly use
nowadays, used to address priests, judges and nobility. It uses the 3rd form
verbs.

The plural form used to be "zu", but since it was adopted as a neutral form
for the singular, a pluralized version was made up: zuek, for both formal and
informal situations.

See: Basque personal pronouns.

### [edit] Bengali

Bengali has three levels of formality in its pronouns; the most neutral forms
of address among closer members of a family are à¦¤à§à¦®à¦¿ tumi and
à¦¤à§à¦®à¦°à¦¾ tomra (plural). These two pronouns are also typically used
when speaking to children, or to younger members of the extended family.
à¦¤à§à¦®à¦¿ tumi is also used when addressing God. When speaking with adults
outside the family, or with senior members of the extended family, the
pronouns à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¿ apni and à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¾à¦°à¦¾ apnara (plural) are used.
This is also true in advertisements and public announcements. A third set of
pronouns, à¦¤à§à¦ tui and à¦¤à§à¦°à¦¾ tora (plural), is reserved for use
between very close friends, and by extension, between relatives who share a
bond not unlike a close friendship. It is also used when addressing people
presumed to be of "inferior" social status; this latter use is occasionally
used when speaking to housemaids, rickshaw-pullers, and other service workers,
although this use is considered offensive.

The situations in which these different pronouns can be used vary considerably
depending on many social factors. In some families, children may address their
parents with à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¿ apni and à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¾à¦°à¦¾ apnara, although this is
becoming increasingly rare. Some adults alternate between all three pronoun
levels when speaking to children, normally choosing à¦¤à§à¦®à¦¿ tumi and
à¦¤à§à¦®à¦°à¦¾ tomra, but also often choosing à¦¤à§à¦ tui and à¦¤à§à¦°à¦¾
tora to indicate closeness, or à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¿ apni or à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¾à¦°à¦¾ apnara
in a joking manner. Additionally, Bengalis vary in which pronoun they use when
addressing servants in the home; some may use à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¿ apni and
à¦à¦ªà¦¨à¦¾à¦°à¦¾ apnara to indicate respect for an adult outside the family,
while others may use à¦¤à§à¦®à¦¿ tumi and à¦¤à§à¦®à¦°à¦¾ tomra to indicate
either inclusion into the family or to indicate somewhat less honorable
status. Others may even use à¦¤à§à¦ tui and à¦¤à§à¦°à¦¾ tora to indicate
inferior status.

### [edit] Bosnian

Use of ti is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any
formal use, vi is used only; ti can be used among peers in a workplace, but
rarely in official documents. It is a common misconception even among native
speakers to always capitalize Vi when used in formal tone but Vi is
capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.

### [edit] Bulgarian

Bulgarian distinguishes between familiar ti (ÑÐ¸) and respectful vie
(Ð²Ð¸Ðµ), which is also used familiar address for several people. (Respectful
Vie may be capitalized, while plural vie is not.) Generally, ti is used among
friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the
relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work
meeting vs. a party). Children always use ti to address each other and are
addressed in this way by adults but are taught to address adults with vie.
When talking to each other young people often start with the formal vie when
talking to each other but may transition to ti very quickly in an informal
situation. Unless there is a substantial difference in social situation (e.g.
teacher and student), the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses ti to
address B, then B also uses ti to address A. While people may transition
quickly from vie to ti, such transition presumes mutual agreement. In the last
years the formal "Vie" form is slowly diminished in some situations, but is
(and will be) still used in formal speech and when addressing someone unknown.

### [edit] Catalan

Catalan vÃ³s follows the same concordance rules as the French vous (verbs in
second person plural, adjectives in singular), and vostÃ¨ follows the same
concordance rules as the Spanish usted (verbs in 3rd person). VostÃ¨
originated from vostra mercÃ¨ as a calque from Spanish, and replaced the
original Catalan form vÃ³s.

In some dialects of Catalan, vÃ³s is no longer used. Other dialects have a
three-way distinction tu/vÃ³s/vostÃ©, where vÃ³s is used as a respectful form
for elders and respected friends, and vostÃ¨ for foreigners and people whom
one does not know well. VostÃ¨ is more distant than vÃ³s.

### [edit] Chinese (Mandarin)

Historically, Mandarin has upheld its T-V distinction rigorously in speech as
well as in writing. This is particularly evident in Beijing, whose dialect
formed the basis for Standard Mandarin. Written Chinese, which generally
strives for a more formal, or even semi-archaic tone, consistently makes the
T-V distinction, sometimes even going so far as to employ archaic forms no
longer used in speech (such as é£ä¸ (éä¸), gÃ©xiÃ , literally, from below
the pagoda, used in extremely formal situations in Imperial China). Although
rarely, åè¾ (qianbei) is still sometimes used in very formal settings, and
when there is a very large chronological age gap between the speaker and the
listener.

In contrast to many European languages, the T-V distinction in Mandarin is
predicated much more on the chronological age of the speakers than on their
social positions. A possible exception is if there is a very large gap in the
social status or social standing within an exchange. For example, formality
may be used when one is addressing one's superior in the workplace, or when a
servant is addressing an employer, or when a waiter at a restaurant is
addressing a customer. People of a similar age who are not acquainted with
each other will generally address each other using the informal ä½ (nÇ). The
formal variant of ä½ (nÇ) is æ¨ (nÃ­n), and the character æ¨ is composed of
ä½ with the element of the heart, å¿ (xÄ«n), added below it. Among its uses,
one addresses older people using æ¨ (nÃ­n). As shown by presence of the
element of the heart in the character, the word is also used to indicate
affection expressed in a formal way. This includes addressing one's parents
using æ¨ (nÃ­n). Situations where two people address each other using æ¨ are
relatively rare, unless expressing such formal affection is the intent of both
parties. æ¨ may thus, for example, be used among close family members. It is
worth noticing that unlike a TV-distinction like the one followed in modern
French with the word "vous", using æ¨ in this way in Mandarin Chinese does
not carry any implication of distance or a lack of intimacy.

In many of the southern Chinese languages (for example Wu), there is no T-V
distinction made at all. Formality in these languages is indicated by use of
different kinship terms only, much like other Asian languages (such as
Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese). Because of this, some southern Chinese, whose
mother tongue is not Mandarin, when speaking Mandarin find it irrelevant,
unnecessary, and sometimes difficult to make the distinction. However, as
almost all native Chinese speakers (including overseas Chinese) understand the
rudimentary rules with regard to the agglutination-cum-contextual rules in
Chinese languages, this is merely a minor set-back at the beginning of the
Mandarin-learning stage â the addition of a å¿ (xÄ«n) to ä½ in æ¨ speaks
for itself. Nevertheless, many southern Chinese often see æ¨ as a form of
expressing (formal) affections only, and do not make the subtle distinction
that æ¨ may be used in various formal communications. This simple linguistic
faux pas has earned many southern migrants in Beijing and other northern
cities a reputation for being rude and uncouth.

Although the plural forms of personal pronouns in Mandarin are typically
formed by adding the suffix -å (-men) (ä»¬ = simplified character) to their
singular counterparts, the construction of æ¨å is quite rare in Standard
Mandarin, indirect constructions such as å¤§å®¶ (dÃ jiÄ, everyone) or è«¸ä½
(zhÅ« wÃ¨i, written language) resp. åä½ (gÃ¨wÃ¨i, polite/formal) being
preferred when addressing a crowd. The use of æ¨å remains extant in the
Beijing dialect[citation needed], however, which retains a number of
distinctions lost in Standard Mandarin. Examples of its use include situations
where a small number of older people with whom one is relatively familiar is
directly addressed, making å¤§å®¶ (dÃ jiÄ) awkward.

### [edit] Croatian

Use of ti is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any
formal use, vi is used only; ti can be used among peers in a workplace, but
rarely in official documents. It is a common misconception even among native
speakers to always capitalize Vi when used in formal tone but Vi is
capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.

### [edit] Czech

See also: Czech verb

Traditionally, use of the informal form was limited for relatives, very close
friends, and for children. During the second half of the 20th century, use of
the informal form grew significantly among coworkers, youth and members of
organisations and groups. The formal form is always used in official documents
and when dealing with a stranger (especially an older one) as a sign of
respect. 2nd-person pronouns (Ty, TvÅ¯j, Vy, VÃ¡Å¡) are often capitalized in
letters, advertisement, etc. The capitalization is optional and is slowly
becoming obsolete. A variant of the formal form modeled after German "Sie"
(Oni/oni, Jejich/jejich, verb onikat) was frequently used during 19th century
but disappeared.

In grammar, plural forms are used in personal and possessive pronouns (vy â
you, vÃ¡Å¡ â your) and in verbs, but not in participles and adjectives, they
are used in singular forms (when addressing a single person). This is a
difference from some other Slavic languages (Slovak, Russian, etc.)

One person  
informal  
(tykÃ¡nÃ­) One person  
formal  
(vykÃ¡nÃ­) More people  
(both formal  
and informal) English  
ty dÄlÃ¡Å¡ vy dÄlÃ¡te vy dÄlÃ¡te you do  
dÄlal jsi dÄlal jste dÄlali jste you did  
jsi hodnÃ½ jste hodnÃ½ jste hodnÃ­ you are kind  
byl jsi pÅijat byl jste pÅijat byli jste pÅijati you were accepted  
Greetings are also connected with T-V distinction. Formal dobrÃ½ den (good
day) and na shledanou (good-bye) are used with formal vy, while ahoj, nazdar,
Äau (meaning both hello, hi, and bye) are informal and used with ty.

### [edit] Danish

In Denmark, the use of the formal forms of address has diminished
significantly over the last twenty years. De is still used in the written
language, in official letters and the like, but the spoken form will be du. De
must be written with a capital "D". For example, a letter from the Inspector
of Taxes inviting you a meeting to go through last year's tax return will use
De, but during the meeting itself, everyone will say du. Waiters might very
occasionally use De, but this is unexpectedly formal.

In general, say du to one person, and I to more than one. Write du if you know
the name of the person to whom you are writing and De if you do not.

The word de with the small "d" is the third-person plural pronoun - equivalent
to "they."

### [edit] Dutch

Dutch has three principal forms of second-person pronouns, namely u, gij and
jij. In the case of gij/jij, ge/je are its unstressed variants. In Dutch, the
T-V distinction is difficult as it relies mainly on (personal) status.

U is the formal pronoun used in all Dutch speaking regions, however gij/jij
are region specific. Jij is preferred in writing in both the Netherlands and
Belgium, but when speech is concerned, Dutch-speakers in Belgium tend to use
gij. The southern part of the Netherlands (mainly Brabant) also uses gij, but
not when addressing people from outside Brabant, as the majority of the
Netherlands uses jij. To address God in Dutch, both gij and U in both the
Netherlands and Belgium are used, never jij.

The pronoun je can also be used impersonally, corresponding to the English
generic you.

In Dutch the formal personal pronoun is used for people with a higher or equal
status, unless the addressed makes it clear (s)he wants to be spoken to with
the informal pronoun. Unlike for example in German, there is no defined line
(in the case of German, roughly when someone passes the age of 16) in which
everyone, apart from family, is addressed with the formal pronoun. A Dutchman
might be called jij by his own cousin, but u by his own children, although
many people use jij to address their parents (the younger generation also uses
jij to their grandparents more and more)

In the closely related Afrikaans language, the same distinction between "jy"
and "u" exists as in Standard Dutch, but "u" now sounds archaic and is dying
out. Instead of using "u", Afrikaans-speakers will often use a person's title
or another term denoting that person's status relative to the speaker: "Oom,
kom jy saam?" ("Uncle, are you coming along?") would be informal usage while
"Oom, kom oom saam?" ("Uncle, is uncle coming along?") would be more formal.
The generic you is expressed in Afrikaans by the term "'n mens" ("a person").

### [edit] English

See also: Thou

Anglo-Saxon (Old English) had no distinction between formal and informal
"you". In the 13th century, the term "ye" was used as a formal version of
"thou" (to superiors or non-intimates) â however, this use was often
contextually-dependent (i.e., changing dynamically according to shifting
nuances in the relationship between two people), rather than static. By the
17th century, "thou" increasingly acquired connotations of contemptuous
address, or of addressing one's social inferiors (so the prosecutor in Sir
Walter Raleigh's 1603 trial declaimed "I thou thee, thou traitor!").
Therefore, the frequency of use of "thou" started to decline, and it was
effectively extinct in the everyday speech of many dialects by the early 18th
century. Its use is now archaic except in certain regional dialects, usually
as "tha", and Modern English today makes no T-V distinction.

The use of the term "thou", however, survives in some liturgical language when
addressing God, most notably in the Lord's Prayer, and is also found in
liturgical dialogue (for example, "V. The Lord be with you R. And with thy
spirit."). This is not an indication of familiarity, but retention of the
original distinction between singular "thou/thee/thy" and plural
"ye/you/your", reflecting the corresponding singular and plural Greek forms in
the original texts.

In Latter-Day Saint prayer tradition, the terms "thee" and "thou" are always
and exclusively used to address Deity, as a mark of respect. [1]

Originally "ye" and "thou" were nominative pronouns, while "you" and "thee"
were accusative forms, but by the 15th century, "you" had begun being used as
a subject pronoun, and only "thee" survived into Quaker "Plain Speech".

### [edit] Esperanto

Esperanto is not a T-V-distinguishing language. Vi is the generic second
person for both singular and plural, just like you in modern English. An
informal second person singular pronoun, ci, does exist, but it is almost
never used in practice. It is mainly intended to make the informal/formal
distinction when translating (literature for example) from languages that do
have the T-V-distinction.

Some have imagined ci as an archaic term that was used before and then fell
out of common usage; however, this is not true. It has only appeared sometimes
in experimental language. In standard Esperanto, vi has always been used since
the beginning. For example, ci appears in neither the Fundamenta Gramatiko nor
in the Unua Libro.

### [edit] Estonian

Estonian is a language with T-V distinction, second person plural (teie) is
used instead of second person singular (sina) as a means of expressing
politeness or formal speech. Sina is the familiar form of address used with
family, friends, and minors. The distinction is still much more widely used
and more rigid than in closely related Finnish language.

Similar to the French language vouvoyer, the verb teietama is used, and teie
is used when addressing a (new) customer or a patient, or when talking to a
person in his/her function. In hierarchical organizations, like large
businesses or armies, sina is used between members of a same rank/level while
teie is used between members of different ranks. Sina (the verb sinatama is
also used) is used with relatives, friends, when addressing children and with
close colleagues. Borderline situations, such as distant relatives, young
adults, customers in a rental shops or new colleagues, sometimes still present
difficulties.

### [edit] Finnish

Today, the use of the informal singular form of address is widespread in all
social circles, even among strangers and in business situations. A counter-
trend has been reported in recent years, whereby some people are choosing to
use the formal plural more often, but in practice it is very unusual to use
this form unless addressing people considerably one's senior or in situations
where strict adherence to form is expected, such as in the military. As the
use of formal plural conveys formal recognition of addressee's status and of
polite distance, the formal plural may also be used jeeringly or to protest
addressee's snobbery. A native speaker may also switch to formal plural when
speaking in anger, as an attempt to remain civil. Advertisements, instructions
and other formal messages are mostly in singular form (sinÃ¤ and its
conjugations).

The number is expressed in pronouns (sinÃ¤ or sÃ¤ for singular, or te for
plural), verb inflections, and possessive suffixes. For example, imperatives
are expressed in the plural, e.g. menkÃ¤Ã¤ "go(pl.)!". Likewise, the -nne
"your" suffix is used instead of the singular -s(i) suffix. There is number
agreement in Finnish, thus you say sinÃ¤ olet "you(sg.) are", but te olette
"you(pl.) are". However, this does not extend to words describing the
addressee, which are in the singular. For example, oletteko te lÃ¤Ã¤kÃ¤ri?
"are(pl.) you(pl.) doctor(sg.)?" A common error, nowadays often made even by
native speakers unused to the formal plural, is using the plural form of the
main verb in the perfect and pluperfect tenses. The main verb should be in the
singular when addressing one person in the formal plural: Oletteko kuullut?
instead of *Oletteko kuulleet? "Have you heard?"

Sometimes the third person is used as a polite form of address, after the
Swedish model: MitÃ¤ rouvalle saisi olla? "What would madam like to have?" The
passive voice may be used to circumvent the choice of the correct form of
address; the passive voice is also the equivalent of the English patronizing
we as in Kuinkas tÃ¤nÃ¤Ã¤n voidaan? "How are we feeling today?"

Finnish language includes the verbs for calling one with informal singular or
formal plural: sinutella, teititellÃ¤, respectively.

### [edit] Frisian

The closest modern language to English, the formal singular nominative jo
(pronounced yo) is very close to the English you and the Middle and Early
Modern English ye. In some parts of eastern Germany, the plural familiar
nominative is jÃ¶ch instead of euch; the former is much closer to its English
counterpart.

### [edit] French

In most French-speaking regions (Canada is an exception; see below), a rigid
tu-vous distinction is upheld. Tu is the second person singular, while vous in
addition to being the second plural is also used to convey formality. Vous is
expected when encountering any completely unknown adult under normal
circumstances. "Abnormal" circumstances (where tu could be used) include
emotional situations like surprising a thief, or addressing informally other
road-users while driving (including swearing at them). New acquaintances who
are conscious of having something socially significant in common (e.g.,
student status, or the same "rank" in some hierarchy) may use tu more or less
immediately as a sign of solidarity. In some cases, there may be an explicitly
defined practice in a particular company, political party, etc. In general,
however, the switch from vous to tu is "negotiated" on a case-by-case basis;
it can happen nearly unconsciously, or it can become extremely complicated.
Rigidly sticking to vous can become equally awkward in a long-standing
relationship. Children (including teenagers) generally use tu to speak with
another child, whether known or not. A long-standing associate of Charles de
Gaulle is said to have suggested that they had known each other long enough to
call each other tu and to have been met with the answer si vous preferez.

Tu can be very offensive, in the mouth of a person who speaks with a stranger
and wants to show disrespect. Vous may be used to distance onself from a
person one does not want to interact with. Two people who use tu in their
private interactions may consciously switch back to vous in public, for
example in a formal or professional environment, or in an artificially
constructed situation (e.g., co-hosts of a television show), or simply to
conceal the nature of their relationship from others. In some families, the
traditional habit is followed: vous is used to address older family members;
more rarely, children are taught to use vous to address their parents, and
vous is sometimes even used between spouses.

When praying, tu is nowadays often used in addressing the deity, as this is a
mark of a personal relationship with God and particularly Christ as one's
savior. The opposite is true, however, in Louisiana where vous is always used
to convey a sense of respect and reverence when praying. (In fact, vous was
used in catholic praying until the Second Vatican Council). When praying the
Hail Mary prayer to the Blessed Virgin, Louisiana French speakers also use the
more formal vous.

The T-V distinction exists only in the singular in French. Vous is the second
person plural pronoun in all situations.

Terminology:

  * tutoyer (verb), tutoiement (noun) â calling someone "tu"
  * vouvoyer (or rarely, vousoyer, voussoyer), vouvoiement (vousoiement, voussoiement) â calling someone "vous"
  * faire schmolitz (Swiss French) â making the transition from vouvoiement to tutoiement, traditionally over a drink

#### [edit] Belgian French

In French-speaking Belgium, usage is mostly identical to that in Standard
French. However, linguistic interference from Dutch and the Walloon
language[2] can influence the speech of those who have these as their first
languages:

  * Flemings who are native-speakers of Dutch have a tendency when speaking French to use tu in as wide a range of contexts (both familiar and formal) as they do the gij / ge of Dutch. A tu used in formal circumstances â which from a native French speaker would normally be taken as a sign of deliberate rudeness â will be "forgiven" when uttered by a native Dutch speaker (as identified by his or her accent).
  * In Walloon, the use of which tends, in any case, to be restricted mostly to "familiar" contexts, vos (=vous) is the general usage and is considered informal and friendly. Ti (=tu), on the other hand, is considered vulgar, and its use can be taken as an expression of an aggressive attitude towards the person addressed. This influence from Walloon affects the usage of tu and vous in the French spoken in Belgium, though more so among people accustomed to using Walloon as their everyday language. The influence of Standard French, particularly as exercised through the mass media, is eroding this particularity amongst younger French-speakers.

#### [edit] North American French

Similarly to Danish, North American dialects of French, including Quebec
French and Acadian French as well as Louisiana Cajun and Creole French, permit
and expect a far broader usage of the familiar tu than in Standard French.
There are still circumstances in which it is appropriate to say vous: in a
formal interview (notably for a job) or when addressing people of very high
rank (such as judges or prime ministers), senior citizens, customers or new
acquaintances in a formal setting. As acquaintances become familiar with one
another, they may find vous to be unnecessarily formal and may agree to return
to the tu with which they are generally more comfortable.

For a number of Francophones in Canada, vous sounds stilted or snobbish, and
archaic. Tu is by no means restricted to intimates or social inferiors. There
is however an important minority of people, often those who call for a use of
standard French in Quebec, who prefer to be addressed as vous. At Radio-Canada
(the public broadcaster, often considered as establishing the normative
objectives of standard French in Canada), the use of vous is widespread even
among colleagues.[citation needed]

Finally, in familiar language, it is usual to use a "generic tu" (cf. English
generic you) instead of "on", which is used solely as a first-person plural.

#### [edit] Sie and du

In German, the respectful form is the same as the third person plural (sie),
rather than the second person plural (which in German is ihr). The second
person sense is always capitalized (Sie) in writing, as well as its accusative
and dative forms, to avoid any ambiguity. Danish and, through Danish,
Norwegian, have adopted[dubious â discuss] this German third person plural
model. Verbs used with this form of address are also identical to third person
plural forms. In requests and demands, it is considered good manners to
combine Sie not only with bitte (please) but also with the subjunctive mood,
for example: WÃ¼rden Sie bitte das Fenster schlieÃen? (Would you (Sie) mind
closing the window please?) instead of SchlieÃen Sie bitte das Fenster!
(Please close the window).

The corresponding informal German address is du. The verbs duzen and siezen
mean respectively "to call du" and "to call Sie" and the phrases per du or auf
du und du mean, "to be on du terms". In general terms, Sie is used with
persons who would be addressed in English with Mr. or Ms., while du is used as
soon as one progresses to first-name terms. In Internet chats and forums,
however, Germans rarely use Sie, although there are exceptions. Sometimes,
switching back to Sie is used as a method of distancing oneself from the
addressee. The connotation is slightly ironic courtesy.

When speaking to more than one person in formal situations, Sie is used in
standard German, although ihr can often be heard instead, especially in the
South of Germany.

In northern Germany, there is an intermediate address combining Sie with the
first name ("Hamburger Sie"), whereas in the Berlin region, sometimes Du is
combined with the surname ("Berliner Du"). The former usage also occurs when
addressing teenagers, household staff, or guests of TV or radio programs,
while the latter style is usually considered inferior and mainly occurs in
working class environments. It may be associated with professional contexts,
when colleagues have known one another for a long time, but, e. g. due to
differences of status, do not want to switch to the usual Du style.

Generally it can be said that everyone up to the age of sixteen can be
addressed as du without problems, with a tendency to start addressing children
with Sie at the age of fourteen in East Germany, while West Germans tend
towards delaying this until the teens are 18. High school students in Germany
are called Sie by their teachers when they enter the Oberstufe â the last 2
or 3 years of high school â around the age of 16 or 17. However, many
students do not mind if their teacher confuses du and Sie, especially if the
teacher and the student have already known each other before the beginning of
the Oberstufe. In most circumstances, adults should at first always be called
Sie. However there are many exceptions; for instance, university students
nowadays always address each other with du (except for some fraternities who
deliberately adopt a so-called 'Siez-Comment'), as do members of the parties
on the political left. Children and teenagers are expected to address all
adults who are not family members as Sie. Street and similar social workers
will usually, sports clubs trainers will sometimes tell children and teens to
address them with du. In shops, bars, and other establishments, if they target
a younger audience, it is becoming increasingly common for customers and staff
to address each other as du, to the degree that it is sometimes considered
awkward if a waitress and a customer who are both in their twenties call each
other Sie.

Usage varies in the German-speaking world when addressing a group containing
both du and Sie persons from the speaker's point of view. Some speakers use
the informal plural ihr, others prefer the formal Sie and many, concerned that
both pronouns might cause offence, prefer to use circumlocutions which avoid
either pronoun.

In Germany, an old custom (called BrÃ¼derschaft trinken, drinking brotherhood)
involves two friends formally sharing a bottle of wine or drinking a glass of
beer together to celebrate their agreement (initially proposed by the elder or
socially higher-standing of the two, or by the lady to the gentleman) to call
one another du rather than Sie. This custom has also been adopted among the
Swiss-French of the Jura, and in Poland (called by its German name,
bruderszaft), though the custom in Poland is now slowly disappearing. It was
formerly found also in Sweden.

It is also a custom to propose the use of du rather than Sie by stating one's
first name (as in: Ich heiÃe...). One accepts the proposal by introducing
one's own first name. Should a person later forget that they have adopted du,
it is polite to remind them by saying, Wir waren doch per du (We moved on to
'du' terms).

#### [edit] Historical predecessors: Ihr and Er/Sie

Ihr, capitalized, was formerly used in addressing social superiors, unless
more informal relations had been established. This form is still found today
in some dialects as a respectful way of addressing elders. This form is
somewhat analogous to the English majestic plural.

Er (male) or Sie (female), capitalized, was similarly used in the second
person to address a social inferior, as a master addressing a servant, but is
now obsolete, except in the Northeast, where it sometimes replaces Sie as
formal address.

Both Ihr and Er/Sie go by a similar grammar rule pertaining to the verb used
with these addresses as modern Sie. The dated capitalized address Ihr demands
the same verb form as the modern second person plural pronoun ihr, and dated
Er/Sie demands the same verb form as the modern third person singular er and
sie.

### [edit] Greek

In Greek, sy (ÏÏ) was originally the singular, and hymeis (Ï Î¼ÎµÎ¯Ï) the
plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. Paul addressed King
Agrippa II as sy (Acts 26:2). Later, hymeis and hÄmeis (Î·Î¼ÎµÎ¯Ï) ("we")
became too close in pronunciation, and a new plural eseis (ÎµÏÎµÎ¯Ï) was
invented. The e (Îµ) of esy (ÎµÏÏ) is a euphonic prefix. In Modern Greek,
ÎµÏÎµÎ¯Ï (esis, second person plural) with second person plural verb
conjugation is used as the formal counterpart of ÎµÏÏ (esi, second person
singular) when talking to strangers and elders. Although in everyday life it
is somehow common to speak to strangers of your age or younger than you using
the singular pronoun. In addition, the informal second person singular is used
even with older people you are acquainted with. Since the formal ÎµÏÎµÎ¯Ï
(esis) starts getting less common outside schools and workplaces, many people
often do not know which form to use (because using a formal version might
sound too snobbish even to an elder and using the informal version might sound
inappropriate to some strangers) and thus prefer to substitute verbs with
nouns (avoiding the dilemma) until enough information on the counterpart's
intentions is gathered in order to use either the formal or the informal
second person pronoun and verb conjugation.

The modern social custom when using the Greek language in Greece is to ask the
other person "may we speak in the singular?" in which the other person is
expected to answer "yes" and afterwards the discussion continues using the
informal ÎµÏÏ (esy, literally thou but in modernity you); it is unthinkable
for the other person to answer "no" or show preference for plural forms, and
for this reason one should not make this question to a person of high status,
such as a professional. Therefore, asking this question can itself be
considered a form of disrespect in some social situations. Likewise, not
asking this question and simply using ÎµÏÏ without prior explicit or
implicit agreement would also be considered disrespectful in various other
social contingencies. In other cases, even using the formal ÎµÏÎµÎ¯Ï
(without a question) could also be considered offensive. A similar social
custom exists with the words ÎºÏÏÎ¹Îµ (mister) and ÎºÏ ÏÎ¯Î± (miss/madame)
which can show both respect and a form of "virtual respect" which essentially
communicates a weak disapproval or "call for return to civility", often
depending on the voice intonation and the social situation.

### [edit] Hebrew

In Hebrew, there is a T-V distinction used in very formal speech only and only
to people of higher authority (for example, a lawyer addressing a judge) or
when speaking to rabbis. The second person singular "××ª×" (ata, masculine)
or "××ª" (at, feminine) are the usual form of address in most other
situations.

The formal form of address when speaking to a person of higher authority is
the third person singular using the person's title without the use of the
pronoun. Thus, a rabbi could be asked: "×××× ××¨× ××¨×¦× ×××××?"
(would the honorable rabbi like to eat?) or a judge told: "×××× ××©××¤×
×× ×××§×©×ª×" (his honor the judge is considering my request).

Other persons of authority are normally addressed by their title only, rather
than by name. In school, teachers are normally addressed as "××××¨×" (the
teacher), for instance, "××××¨×, ××¤×©×¨ ××¦××ª?" (the teacher, may I
go out?). Officers and commanders in the army are addressed as "×××¤×§×"
(hamfaked, "the commander") by troops.

In non-Hebrew-speaking Jewish culture, the second-person form of address is
similarly avoided in cases of higher authority (e.g., a student in a yeshiva
would be far more likely to say in a classroom discussion "yesterday the rabbi
told us..." than "yesterday you told us..."). However, this usage is limited
to more conservative (i.e. Orthodox) circles.[3]

### [edit] Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu)

In both versions of Hindustani, there are three levels of honorifics:

  * à¤à¤ª Ø¢Ù¾ Äp/[aËp]: Formal and respectable form for you. Used in all formal settings and speaking to persons who are senior in job or age. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" (à¤à¤ª à¤²à¥à¤ Ø¢Ù¾ ÙÙÚ¯ Äp log)) or "you all" (à¤à¤ª à¤¸à¤¬ Ø¢Ù¾ Ø³Ø¨ Äp sab).
  * à¤¤à¥à¤® ØªÙÙ  tum/[tum]: Informal form of you. Used in all informal settings and speaking to persons who are junior in job or age. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" (à¤¤à¥à¤® à¤²à¥à¤ ØªÙÙ ÙÙÚ¯ tum log) or "you all" (à¤¤à¥à¤® à¤¸à¤¬ ØªÙÙ Ø³Ø¨ tum sab).
  * à¤¤à¥ ØªÙÙ tÅ«/[tuË]: Extremely informal form of you, as thou. Strictly singular, its plural form would be à¤¤à¥à¤® ØªÙÙ tum. Inappropriate use of this form â i.e. other than in addressing children, very close friends, or in poetic language (either with God or with lovers) â risks being perceived as offensive in Pakistan or India.

### [edit] Hungarian

Hungarian provides numerous, often subtle means of T-V distinction:

The use of the second-person conjugation with the pronoun te (plural ti) is
the most informal mode. As in many other European languages, it is used within
families, among children, lovers, close friends, (nowadays often) among
coworkers, and in some communities, suggesting an idea of brotherhood. Adults
unilaterally address children this way, and it is the form used in addressing
God and other Christian saints (such as Jesus Christ or the Blessed Virgin),
animals, and objects or ideas. Sociologically, the use of this form is
widening. Whereas traditionally the switch to te is often a symbolic milestone
between people, sometimes sealed by drinking a glass of wine together
("pertu"), today people under the age of about thirty will often mutually
adopt te automatically in informal situations. A notable example is the
Internet: strangers meeting online use the informal forms of address virtually
exclusively, regardless of age or status differences; even Prime Minister
Ferenc GyurcsÃ¡ny encouraged[4] people in his blog to use te mutually when
asking him. (A slang term for someone using formal speech in, for example, a
chat room is an "InÃ¶nrnet", which is "te", informal "you", replaced with
"Ã¶n", formal "you", in the word "Internet".) IKEA (or rather, its Hungarian
team) was noted and practically unique in its choice of this way of addressing
people in Hungary in its brochures; reactions were mixed.

Nevertheless, formal forms of address are alive and well in Hungarian:

  * The third-person verb conjugation is the primary basis of formal address. The choice of which pronoun to use, however, is fraught with difficulty (and indeed a common solution when in doubt is to simply avoid using any pronoun at all). 
    * The pronoun maga (plural maguk), for instance, is considered the basic formal equivalent of "you", but may not be used indiscriminately, as it tends to imply an existing or desired personal acquaintance. (It would not, for instance, ordinarily be used in a conversation where the relative social roles are predominantly important â say, between professor and student.) Typical situations where maga might be used are, e.g., distant relatives, neighbours, fellow travellers on the train, or at the hairdresser's. If one already knows these people, they may even take offence if one were to address them more formally. On the other hand, some urbanites tend to avoid maga, finding it too rural, old-fashioned, offensive or even intimate.
    * Ãn (plural Ã¶nÃ¶k) is the formal, official and impersonal "you". It is the form used when people take part in a situation merely as representatives of social roles, where personal acquaintance is not a factor. It is thus used in institutions, business, bureaucracy, advertisements, by broadcasters, by shopkeepers to their customers, and whenever one wishes to maintain one's distance. It is less typical of rural areas or small towns, more typical of cities. It's often capitalized in letters.
    * Other pronouns are nowadays rare, restricted to rural, jocular, dialect, or old-fashioned speech. Such are, for instance, kend and kegyed.
    * There is a wide spectrum of third-person address that avoids the above pronouns entirely; preferring to substitute various combinations of the addresseeâs names and/or titles. Thus, for instance, a university student might ask mit gondol X. tanÃ¡r Ãºr? ("What does Professor X. think?", meant for the addressee) rather than using the insufficiently formal maga or the overly impersonal Ã¶n. (Note that it is possible because the formal second-person conjugation of verbs is the same as the third-person conjugation.)
  * Finally, the auxiliary verb tetszik (lit. "It pleases [you]") is an indirect alternative (or, perhaps, supplement) to direct address with the third or even second person. It is very polite (sometimes seen as over-polite) but not as formal as the Ãn/maga form. Children usually address adults outside their family this way. Adults may address more distant relatives, housekeepers and older persons using this form, and some men habitually address older or younger women this way (this is slightly old-fashioned).

Example: "you" in the nominative  
"Will you be leaving tomorrow?" Example: "you" in the accusative  
"I saw you yesterday on the television."  
Te (Te) holnap utazol el? LÃ¡ttalak tegnap a tÃ©vÃ©ben.  
Maga (Maga) holnap utazik el? LÃ¡ttam magÃ¡t tegnap a tÃ©vÃ©ben.  
Ãn (Ãn) Ã¶nt  
â  (A) TanÃ¡r Ãºr* (a) TanÃ¡r urat*  
Tetszik Holnap tetszik elutazni? LÃ¡ttam tegnap (a) Mari nÃ©nit** a tÃ©vÃ©ben.  
OR LÃ¡ttam magÃ¡t tegnap a tÃ©vÃ©ben.  
    * "TanÃ¡r Ãºr" is a form of addressing for professors (cf. "Sir"); "tanÃ¡r urat" is the accusative. Other forms of addressing are also possible, to avoid specifying the maga and Ã¶n pronouns.
    ** "Mari nÃ©nit" is an example name in the accusative (cf. "Aunt Mary").
### [edit] Icelandic

In modern Icelandic the formal second person pronoun (Ã¾Ã©r or ÃÃ©r for both
singular and plural) is archaic. Today, it is used only on rare occasions when
one intends to be extremely formal or when one wants to treat another person
with contempt, or create/maintain distance between the parties. The formal
pronoun is sometimes used in translations from a language that adheres to
them, in formalized official correspondence and court proceedings. Some
phrases such as excuse me (afsakiÃ° mig) and good appetite (gjÃ¶ri Ã¾Ã©r svo
vel) are still commonly used with the formal second person pronoun and
traditional sayings such as seek and you shall find (leitiÃ° og Ã¾Ã©r muniÃ°
finna).

### [edit] Ido

In theory tu is limited to friends and family, whereas vu is used anywhere
else. However, many users actually adapt the practice in their own mother
tongue and use tu and vu accordingly. In the plural, though, the only form in
use is vi, which does not distinguish between formal and informal address.

In all cases, an -n is added to the original pronoun to indicate a direct
object that precedes its own verb: Me amoras tu (I love you) becomes Tun me
amoras if the direct object takes the first place, for example for emphatic
purposes.

### [edit] Italian

In Italian the formal second person singular pronoun is lei, which means
"she", with the third person singular of the verb. The lei is sometimes
capitalized as a sign of respect, particularly in administrative or business
correspondence; if the pronoun is capitalized, so are all its forms, including
the enclitics: "...vorrei incontrarLa per parlarGliene" "...I should like to
meet you to talk to you about this".  
It is also possible to use Ella as a very polite alternative, but this is very
rarely used and is perceived as archaic or snobbish, since in Italian egli
("he"), essi ("they") and especially ella ("she") have fallen out of common
use, being replaced by lui ("him"), loro ("them") and lei ("her").  
For the background to the use of "her" as a polite pronoun, see the section
"History" below.

Lei is nowadays generally concorded with the gender of the addressee; it might
actually not be present in sentences as Italian is not subject-compulsory, and
is then understood by the verb being conjugated in the third person.

  * "Have you ever been in Rome?" 
    * "[Lei] Ã¨ mai stato a Roma?" (-o: to a male)
    * "[Lei] Ã¨ mai stata a Roma?" (-a: to a female. But this can also be addressed to a male, in a very formal style).

The polite plural form Loro ("them"), followed by a verb in the third plural
person, is rarely used nowadays; voi is normally used both in informal and
formal contexts when addressing more than one person. The main situation where
Loro might still be heard is in restaurants, because many waiters still use
this form to address customers.

  * "What do you wish to eat?" 
    * "Che cosa desiderate mangiare?" (voi is understood)
    * "Che cosa desiderano mangiare?" (loro is understood)

Voi ("you", plural) might be used by some speakers instead of lei, especially
in Southern Italy, but it sounds old-fashioned. When it is addressed
respectfully to one person, the pronoun voi is used with singular adjectives
and participles, concorded with the gender of the addressee, although the
verbs are still in the second person plural form.

Lei is normally used in formal settings, or with strangers, and it is used
reciprocally between adults: the usage may not be reciprocal when young people
address older strangers or otherwise respected people. Students are addressed
with tu by their teachers until the end of high school, and with lei in
universities. Students might say tu to their teachers in elementary school,
but switch to lei from middle school. Currently, people tend to address
strangers of their own age using the informal tu until about thirty years of
age. Tu is also the pronoun of first choice to address strangers on the
Internet. In prayers, tu is nowadays used; in the past, voi was a possible
alternative.  
There's a wide range of possible forms on instruction booklets: tu, lei and
voi (the last intended as a plural pronoun) are all acceptable; instructions
may also be given in an impersonal way using verbs in the infinitive form,
thus avoiding the problem of choosing a personal pronoun. In advertisements,
companies usually address their customers using tu: lei sounds too distant, tu
suggests a closer relationship between the company and its customers. In
administrative correspondence and on very formal invitations, la S.V. may be
written instead of the pronoun lei: "La S.V. Ã¨ invitata...". The abbreviation
stands for la Signoria Vostra "Your Lordship/Ladyship", which is the
historical basis for the use of the third person feminine pronoun (see also
below).

#### [edit] History

At the beginning of its history, in the Middle Ages, the Italian language had
a tu/voi distinction of formality, as with other Romance languages; in his
Divine Comedy (begun in 1307), Dante normally uses tu when talking to the
people he meets, but addresses them with voi when he means to show particular
respect, for example to his former teacher ("Siete voi qui, ser Brunetto?").

During the Renaissance the use of lei as a polite pronoun began, with some
subsequent influence from Spanish; the origin of lei is due to expressions as
"Your Lordship/Eminence/Majesty/Holiness/...", where all of these nouns were
feminine in gender (Vostra Signoria/Eminenza/MaestÃ /SantitÃ /...) and
referred to in the third person singular.

For a few centuries (possibly from the 16th century to the beginning of the
20th century) there was a three-pronoun system in use, with tu/voi/lei
employed with a growing degree of formality; this was very well exemplified in
Manzoni's novel The Betrothed (written in 1840-42 and set in 1628-30), where
the characters talk using all three pronouns: the usage was often not
reciprocal, with several combinations based on age and social status.

In 1938, under Fascist rule, the use of lei was banned on nationalistic
grounds, since the use of voi was thought of as "more Italian"; the ban lasted
only for a few years, until the end of World War II, and left little trace.
However, in some parts of Italy, particularly in Southern Italy, voi had
always been preferred as the polite form and continued to be used regionally,
while lei definitely prevailed as the standard V-form.

### [edit] Japanese

In Japanese, as in Vietnamese, kinship terms, titles, or names are commonly
used instead of first-, second- or third-person pronouns. As in Korean, there
are several levels of politeness regarding to social hierarchy, and polite
language encompasses not only pronouns, but verb endings and vocabulary as
well. (See the articles Japanese pronouns and Honorific speech in Japanese for
more information.)

### [edit] Korean

Much like Japanese, the Korean language has complex gradations. It uses
honorifics and no less than seven speech levels, each with a singular/plural
distinction, making for fourteen basic verb stems. Nevertheless, most levels
have all but disappeared from everyday language, so one can simplify this into
the basic distinction between plain and polite conjugations of verbs and
adjectives. In general, the plain form is used when speaking to family, close
friends, and social inferiors, and the polite form otherwise. When two Korean-
speaking strangers meet where none is the obvious social superior, both use
the polite form; when it is determined that one or both can switch to the
plain form, one often asks for permission for this switch. The phrase used to
describe this is mareul nota (literally âto release languageâ). In Korean,
the polite form is called jondaenmal and the plain form is called yesanmal or
banmal. In contrast to the neutral term yesanmal, banmal (literally âhalf
speechâ) often has a rather negative connotation, referring for instance to
the plain form that one may deliberately use to provoke someone who should be
addressed in the polite form.

There is a similar phenomenon called nopimmal, which is honorific speech
triggered not by the addressee but by the content of an expression. It is used
independently of the speech levels. For example, in -hasimnida âdo(es)
â¦â, the speaker uses the infix -si- to honour the subject of the sentence
and the ending -mnida to express courtesy or politeness (or simply his
distance) towards the addressee. As the subject of the sentence and the
addressee do not have to be the same person both forms can be mixed. The
speaker can honour a higher person he is talking about with the infix -si-
while talking to a friend who is addressed in the informal banmal.

### [edit] Lithuanian

Historically, aside from familiar tu and respectful jÅ«s or JÅ«s, also used to
express plural, there was a special form tamsta, mostly referred to in third
person singular (although referring in second person singular is also not
uncommon). This form was used to communicate with a stranger who has not
earned particular respect (a beggar, for example). Through the Soviet
occupation period, however, this form was mostly replaced by standard neutral
form drauge ('comrade' in vocative form), and by now tamsta is used sparsely.

### [edit] Malay

As there are many additions to the vocabulary of the Malay language, Standard
Malay today is a result of many years of various refinements (the Malay
language was never, and is still not, taught in a strictly prescriptive
manner).

### [edit] Norwegian

In Norwegian, the polite form "De" is rarely heard in spoken language.
Norwegians almost exclusively use du in their daily life. De is still used in
formal situations or when talking to elderly people. De can also be found in
written works, business letters, theatrical plays and translations where an
impression of formality must be retained. A popular saying is that "De" is
reserved for the king.

However, it should be mentioned that Norwegians also generally refer to one
another by first name only unless the person is better known by their full or
last name only, putting this weakening of the courteous pronoun into a general
pattern of declining use of polite speech (for town dwellers), or of a return
to traditions of the near past (for country-dwellers). For example, a student
might address his professor John Doe, not as "Mr./Dr. Doe", but as "John", but
would refer to the former president of the US as "Bush", not "George".
However, Norwegian politicians and celebrities are sometimes referred to by
their first names, especially in newspaper headlines. Nicknames are not very
common.

As the distinction between BokmÃ¥l and Nynorsk exists only for written
Norwegian (Nynorsk writers speaking more or less their respective dialects),
the T-V rules are the same for both forms.

### [edit] Polish

Main article: Polish name#Formal and informal use

### [edit] Portuguese

Further information: Portuguese personal pronouns

In Brazilian Portuguese, vocÃª and vocÃªs (singular and plural "you",
respectively) are used informally, while o senhor and a senhora ("mister" and
"mistress", plurals os senhores and as senhoras) are used in formal speech.
Although, in some parts of country (southern states, some of north and
northeast states) "tu" (singular "you") is used informally, but the plural
form is always "vocÃªs".

In European Portuguese (as well as in Africa and Asia), tu (singular "you") is
commonly used as the informal addressing pronoun, while "vocÃª" is used in
formal or semi-formal situations; vocÃªs (plural) is used for both formal and
informal speech. The forms o senhor and a senhora (plurals os senhores and as
senhoras) are used for the most formal situations (roughly equivalent to
"mister" and "mistress".)

However, there is considerable regional variation in the use of these terms,
and more specific forms of address are sometimes employed.

Historically, vocÃª derives from vossa mercÃª ("your mercy" or "your grace")
via the intermediate forms vossemecÃª and vosmecÃª; compare with the
derivation of Spanish usted from vuestra merced. For that reason, vocÃª and
vocÃªs require verbs conjugated in the third person, rather than the second
person.

The second person plural pronoun vÃ³s ("thou"), from Latin vos, has fallen
into disuse in all but a few regional dialects of Northern Portugal, where it
expresses an intermediate degree of formality between tu and vocÃª(s). Its use
is kept as an archaism in literature (historical setting), prayer (when
addressing a deity) or exaggerated (mocking) ceremonial.

### [edit] Romanian

Romanian dumneavoastrÄ when used for the second-person singular formal takes
plural verbs but singular adjectives, similar to French vous. It is used
roughly in the same manner as in Continental French and shows no signs of
disappearing. It is also used as a more formal voi. It originates from domnia
voastrÄ \- your lordship. As it happens with all subjective pronouns
dumneavoastrÄ is many times omitted from sentences, its use being implied by
verbs in the second person plural form.

The form dumneata (originating from domnia ta \- thy lordship) is less distant
than dumneavoastrÄ and somewhat midway between tu and dumneavoastrÄ. The
verb is conjugated, as for tu, in the second person singular form. Older
people towards younger people and peers favor Dumneata. Its use is gradually
declining. An even more colloquial form of dumneata is mata.

Furthermore, there is an even more familiar term than "tu" used in some
regions of Romania â matale. It is used only with immediate family members,
and is spelled and pronounced the same in all cases, similar to
"dumneavoastrÄ." It is conjugated in the second-person singular, like "tu."

### [edit] Russian

Russian distinguishes between familiar ty (ÑÑ) and respectful vy (Ð²Ñ) â
which is also the plural of both forms, used to address a pair or group.
(Respectful Vy may be capitalized, while plural vy is not.) Generally, ty is
used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the
closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the
situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use ty to address
each other and are addressed in this way by adults but are taught to address
adults with vy. Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the
family as vy regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as ty in return.
When talking to each other young people often start with the formal vy when
talking to each other but may transition to ty very quickly in an informal
situation. Among older people, ty is often reserved for closer acquaintances.
Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is
symmetric: if A uses ty to address B, then B also uses ty to address A. While
people may transition quickly from vy to ty, such transition presumes mutual
agreement. Use of ty without consent of the other person is likely to be
viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult, particularly if the other party
maintains using vy.

Historically, the rules have been in favor of more formal usage; as late as
the 19th century, it was accepted in many circles (generally among the more
educated) that vy is to be used between close friends, between husband and
wife, and when addressing one's parents (but not one's children), all of which
situations today would strongly call for using ty.

The choice between ty and vy is closely related, yet sometimes different, from
the choice of the addressing format â that is, the selection from the first
name, patronymics, last name, and the title to be used when addressing the
person. Normally, ty is associated with the informal addressing by first name
only (or, even more informally, by the last name only), whereas vy is
associated with the more formal addressing format of using the first name
together with patronymics (roughly analogous to "title followed by last name"
in English) or the last name together with a title (the last name is almost
never used together with either of the other two names to address someone,
although such combinations are routinely used to introduce or mention
someone).

### [edit] Scottish Gaelic

The informal form of the second-person singular in Scottish Gaelic is thu
(emphatic: thusa), used when addressing a person the speaker knows well, or
when addressing a person younger or relatively the same age as the speaker.
When addressing a superior, an elder, or a stranger, or in conducting
business, the form sibh (emphatic: sibhse) is used. (Sibh is also the second
person plural). This distinction carries over into prepositional pronouns: for
instance, agad and agaibh (at you), riut and ruibh (with you), umad and umaibh
(about you), etc.

### [edit] Serbian

Use of ti is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any
formal use, vi is used only; ti can be used among peers in a workplace, but
rarely in official documents. It is a common misconception even among native
speakers to always capitalize Vi when used in formal tone but Vi is
capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.

  

### [edit] Slovenian

Though the use of ti ("tikanje") is officially limited to friends and family
and talk among children, it is increasingly used among the middle generation
to signal a relaxed attitude or lifestyle instead of its polite or formal
counterpart vi ("vikanje"). An additional seemingly ungrammatical use of the
singular verb following the "plural" vi ("polvikanje") has become widespread,
to signal a somewhat more friendly and less formal attitude while maintaining
politeness:

  * Vi ga niste videli. ("You have not seen him": verb videti in plural.)
  * Vi ga niste videl/videla. ("You have not seen him": verb videti in singular masculine/feminine.)

This use is considered non-standard.

The use of oni ("onikanje", the use of third person plural in direct address)
as the extreme polite form is now archaic or dialectal; it is associated with
servant-master relationships in older literature or child-parent relationship
in certain conservative rural communities.

### [edit] Spanish

Further information: Spanish dialects and varieties

In Spanish, the respectful form requires verbs to be conjugated in the third
person singular; this is because the form usted evolved from the title vuestra
merced (your grace) which naturally took the third person like the Portuguese
vocÃª. In some cases, if a younger person speaks to someone who is relatively
older, the younger of the pair will address the elder with usted, perhaps
combining it with Don. However, an altered form of vuestra merced, su merced
(which in colloquial language has been corrupted to sumercÃ©), has survived in
the rural areas located in the plateau that surrounds Colombia's capital city,
BogotÃ¡.

In most dialects, close friends are referred to as tÃº, and venerable old
women are usted, but there is a wide grey area in the middle. Even that is not
universally true: in the Spanish dialects of some parts of Latin America (for
example, in many parts of Colombia and Guatemala, as well as Chiapas, the
southernmost state of Mexico), tÃº is almost never used, not even with close
friends or relatives, which are usted. Similarly in the Rioplatense Spanish
variant used in most of Argentina and Uruguay tÃº is generally replaced by vos
(see voseo). The use of tÃº has its highest prevalence in Spain, as well as
Mexico and Peru since these were the administrative centers of the Spanish
Empire and so more readily kept up with changes in fashions in Spain (although
Mexican and Peruvian Spanish are certainly not identical to the European
dialects). Notably the Spanish-speakers in the United States tend to follow
Mexican conventions because most are Mexican immigrants or descendants
thereof.

The history behind tÃº-vos-usted is that for a time all three forms existed in
Spain including during the colonization of the Americas. In most of Spain the
vos form died out and is now largely regarded as an archaic expression and
this attitude has been adopted in most of Mexico, Peru, and other countries.
Some countries, like Argentina, have preserved the vos form instead regarding
tÃº as being the archaic term.

In the plural, Spanish presents the T-form vosotros and the V-form ustedes,
which uses verbs in the second and third person plural, respectively. However,
only Northern Spain has retained this distinction, while in the Canaries and
Latin America, ustedes is the only form used in all contexts. In Andalusia and
Extremadura, ustedes is used as well, but combined with the verb forms
corresponding to vosotros in standard European Spanish.

### [edit] Swedish

In Swedish, there has in the last two centuries been a marked difference
between usage in Finland-Swedish and in Sweden.

In Finland-Swedish, the second person plural form Ni (noted as formal above)
was indeed the traditional respectful address to a single person up to the
1970s or so.

In mainland Swedish, the polite Ni was known from earlier epochs, but had come
to be considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate
system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost
altogether:

  * addressing in third person singular adding title and (second) name was considered proper and respectful in most cases. But with persons of higher standing, say a doctor, count or managing director, there arose the question when to use that title only and when to precede it with a herr ('mister' or, in this connection, 'sir'); not doubling such titles could be very rude unless you were on somewhat informal terms.  
A woman, married to a husband with a specific title, was addressed using the
feminine form of her husband's title as a matter of course. This created its
own set of problems as more and more women acquired professional titles of
their own.

  * If you were somewhat acquainted and not too far apart in rank and age, you could then drop the name and use the title onlyâwith the same problem of single or double title as above.
  * surname without title was considered proper between friends not too close and for a superior to his subordinate or someone of similar rank. That was also customary in male brotherhoods like between students.
  * Below that on the social scale, both among peers and from above, was the third person singular pronoun only (han 'he', less often hon 'she'). That was more usual in the countryside; considered rustic by "educated" people, but fitting towards e.g. an old fisher- or woodman.
  * Simple folks of venerable age could be properly addressed far ('father';less usual) and mor ('mother') plus Christian name, both by their own and by superiors.  
The sex difference in the two addresses above was caused mainly by the hon
('she') being felt as too direct, maybe a covert insult or sign of doubt as to
the addressee's decency. If she was a farmwife or the like, she could be
called mor etc. even if young; otherwise, one had to make do with the nearest-
fitting other way of addressing.

  * A master could address his servant, or a farmer his farmhand, by Christian name for pronoun; that was more common between females, as the female world was generally more confined, but restricted between the sexes unless the social gap was very wide.
  * A subordinate, in each case, answered by using the superior's title or titles or, in private, the informal term for his rank (e.g. herrn, patron).
  * Kinship term plus Christian name, still never alternating with pronoun, was proper in private to nearer older relatives.
  * The second person singular du was used only to and between children, within a married couple, between lovers or to a more or less voluntary mistress of lower standing, and between friends who had druckit duskÃ¥l ('toasted for thou', as it were; infinitive dricka duskÃ¥l) with each otherâof course initiated by the elder or higher-ranked party. Again, the custom could be somewhat more relaxed among womenâat least the toast itself was usually dispensed with. Then, du could be used to insult a tramp or the like.

Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the
essentials held up into the 1960s.

    In the province of Dalarna (Dalecarlia),however, and in a few other remote places with few upper class people, the du/ni distinction had remained one of number only; possibly, children addressed their parents with far (Father) and mor (Mother) also when du would otherwise have been more logical.  
In some other remote places, the ni survived as both second person plural
pronoun and polite addressâto elders, including one's parents, not
classified with "better people"âbut in its older form I. In standard
Swedish, that form had become archaic and solemn well before the 20th century.
(I is always capitalized, not out of respect but to avoid confusion with the
preposition i ('in').)

As the twentieth century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing,
with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence,
was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the
circumlocutions one-degree furtherâfinding impersonal ways of saying what
was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title. (FÃ¥r det lov att vara
en kopp kaffe?, approximately 'Would a cup of coffee be allowed, please?'; SÃ¥
det Ã¤r till att resa?, approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'). However,
that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, you still had to address the
person you talked with directly from time to time in the conversation,
otherwise you would really have sounded impoliteâand over time, it became de
rigueur to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish
titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and
for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations,
to be observant uponâe.g., that in the second example above being perceived
as more and more rustic, ending up rude.  
Then in the 'sixties, things happened fast. First, authorities and influential
circles tried rehabilitating the Ni in a so-called "ni reform"âbut most
people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, almost
overnight and dubbed the "du reform", the system broke down and

  * du (noted as informal above) became the accepted way of addressing any one person except royalty.
  * Only slightly less accepted is the use of Christian name also when addressing an unknown person (Daniel, Pia, etc.). Some people try to avoid the name altogether when speaking to an unknown (older) person, a representative of authority or the like, but the pronoun is still du.
  * Addressing royalty went somewhat more slowly from a universal Ers majestÃ¤t ('Your Majesty'), etc., to that address only on formal occasions, otherwise replaced by third person (singular if the addressee is single) with title (K(on)ungen 'the King', etc.).

  
These rules still apply, with marginal exceptions.

In a few circles of younger people, mostly in the larger cities, the use of
the extinct Ni for polite address has gained ground againânotably among some
shop assistants and waiters for addressing customers in shops and guests in
restaurants.[citation needed]. It may also occur that a young person cannot
bring him- or herself to address a venerable (and perhaps upper-class) old
person du, and then takes recourse to the ni. In addition, Ni has become a
fashionable address in some circles of younger businessmen[citation needed].
But whether this is a fashion, coquettery on some parts, a sign of uncertainty
in a time of social change, or a beginning of something, is much too early to
say. The vast majority of Swedes, including younger people in most or all
situations, stick to the du as of this writing (2007).

In order to "alleviate the intrusion" in writing, e.g. in letters or in
advertisement, the Du can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in
the early days of universal du address; it has become slightly more common
again simultaneously with the partial Ni revival.

Finland-Swedish has undergone a similar development to mainland Swedish since
the 1960s, but slower and slightly less. There, one may have to reckon with
influence from the Finnish language, still slightly more conservative.

Swedish, also, has verbs for the addresses: dua 'to say du ', and nia 'to say
ni '.

### [edit] Thai

In Thai, first, second, and third person pronouns vary in formality according
to the social standing of the speaker and the referent and the relationship
between them. For a non-exhaustive list of Thai second person pronouns, see
http://www.into-asia.com/thai_language/grammar/you.php.

### [edit] Turkish

In contemporary Turkish, T-V distinction is strong. Friends and family members
speak to one another using the second singular person "sen" as well as adults
use "sen" to address minors. In formal situations (meeting people first time,
business, customer-clerk, colleagues) second plural "siz" is used widely. In
very formal situations, double plural second person "sizler" may be used to
refer to a much-respected person. Rarely, third plural conjugation of the verb
(but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. In imperative,
there are three forms: second singular person for informal, second plural
person for formal and double plural second person for very formal situations:
"gel" (second singular, informal), "gelin" (second plural, formal), "geliniz"
(double second plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently
used.

### [edit] Ubykh

In the extinct Ubykh language, the T-V distinction was most notable between a
man and his mother-in-law, where the plural form sÊ¸Ã¦ghÊ·a supplanted the
singular wÃ¦ghÊ·a very frequently, possibly under the influence of Turkish.
The distinction was upheld less frequently in other relationships, but did
still occur.

### [edit] Uyghur

The Uyghur language is notable for using four different forms, to distinguish
both singular and plural in both formal and informal registers. The informal
plural silÃ¤r originated as a contraction of sizlÃ¤r, which uses a regular
plural ending. In Old Turkic, as still in modern Turkish, siz was the original
second-person plural. However, in modern Uyghur siz has become restricted to
the formal singular, requiring the plural suffix -lÃ¤r for the plurals.

Siz as the formal singular pronoun is characteristic of ÃrÃ¼mchi dialect,
which is the Uyghur literary standard. In Turfan they say sili and in Kashgar
dialect, Ã¶zlÃ¤r. Sili is also used in other areas sometimes, while in
literary Uyghur Ã¶zlÃ¤r as a singular pronoun is considered a
"hyperdeferential" level of respect; the deferential plural form is
hÃ¤rqaysiliri.

### [edit] Vietnamese

Main article: Vietnamese pronouns

Vietnamese does not have a clear concept of pronouns. Any noun can be used to
refer to people, especially kinship terms. Pronouns are sometimes not needed
in a normal conversation, as the speaker can always refer to him/herself, the
audience, and others directly by name, which might seem strange to English
speakers. The nouns used to refer to people can reveal not only the level of
formality, but also the social relationship between the speaker and the person
being referred to, differences in age, and even the attitude of the speaker
toward the person whom is being referred.

There is an informal second-person pronoun: mÃ y. This term is always
condescending and should only be used with someone who is both familiar with
and subordinate to the speaker. Young people also utilize it frequently.

### [edit] Yiddish

Yiddish makes use of the second person plural form as the polite form for both
singular and plural. In the second person plural form ×××¨ there is
therefore no distinction between formal and informal forms. There is a pronoun
×¢×¥ utilized strictly for informal second-person form but this pronoun is
rarely used.

Given that old German dialects were the main influence on the development of
the Yiddish language, this form may be recognized with older polite forms of
the German language[citation needed].
