Many Japanese words of Portuguese origin entered the Japanese language when
Portuguese Jesuit priests introduced Christian ideas, Western science and
technology, among other things to the Japanese during the Muromachi period
(15-16th century).

## [edit] List of loanwords

Many of the first words which were introduced and entered the Japanese
language from Portuguese and Dutch are written in kanji or hiragana, rather
than katakana, which is the more common way to write loanwords in Japanese in
modern times. Kanji versions of the words are ateji, characters that are
"fitted" or "applied" to the words by the Japanese, based on either the
pronunciation or the meaning of the word.

The sign â shows that the word is a historical, extinct one.

## [edit] ArigatÅ

Sister project Look up ãããã¨ã in  
Wiktionary, the free dictionary.  
It is often suggested that the Japanese word arigatÅ derives from the
Portuguese obrigado, both of which mean "Thank you," but this is demonstrably
false. The Japanese phrase arigatÅ is a shortened form of arigatÅ gozaimasu,
meaning "Thank you". This is a form of an adjective, arigatai, for which
written records exist dating back to the Man'yÅshÅ«, well before Japanese
contact with Portugal.[4]

The full derivation is arigatÅ < arigatau < arigataku < arigatashi < ari \+
katashi. The medial -k- drops out from -aku- resulting in /au/. This then
becomes /oË/ via regular phonological rules. Ari is a verb meaning "to be"
and katashi is an adjective meaning "difficult". The original meaning of
"arigatashi" was "difficult to be", ie "rare" and thus "special". This
derivation tries to stem the word to its structural meanings and does not
consider the current word's sentimental development and appreciated meaning.

Superficial appearances notwithstanding, there is absolutely no linguistic
relationship to the Portuguese word obrigado of the same meaning.
