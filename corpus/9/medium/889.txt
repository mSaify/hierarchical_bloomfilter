Gratis versus libre is the distinction between "for zero price" (gratis) and
"freedom" (libre). Gratis appears in many English dictionaries, including the
Oxford English Dictionary. However, libre does so less commonly, and no
English adjective signifies "liberty" exclusively and as distinct from "at no
monetary cost". This distinction is often important in dealing with laws
concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents. The terms
are often used in the free software and open source communities, as well as
the broader free culture movement, to categorize computer programs according
to the licenses and legal restrictions that cover them. Both this expression
and the term gratis are used to distinguish freeware (gratis software) from
freedom (libre) software.

Richard Stallman summarised the difference in a slogan: "Think free as in free
speech, not free beer."[1]

"for free", "free of charge", "at zero cost", in the sense that one does not
have to pay for some good or service, even though the good or service may have
value.
