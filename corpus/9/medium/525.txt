Mandarin Chinese in light brown. Standard Mandarin is based on the particular
dialect of Mandarin spoken in Beijing.

Standard Mandarin, or Standard Chinese, is the official modern Chinese spoken
language used in mainland China and Taiwan, and is one of the four official
languages of Singapore.

The phonology of Standard Mandarin is based on the Beijing dialect of
Mandarin, a large and diverse group of Chinese dialects spoken across northern
and southwestern China. The vocabulary is largely drawn from this group of
dialects. The grammar is standardized to the body of modern literary works
written in Vernacular Chinese, which in practice follows the same tradition of
the Mandarin dialects with some notable exceptions. As a result, Standard
Mandarin itself is usually just called "Mandarin" in non-academic, everyday
usage. However, linguists use "Mandarin" to refer to the entire language. This
convention will be adopted by the rest of this article.

## [edit] Native names

Standard Mandarin is officially known

  * in mainland China, Hong Kong [2] and Macau as Putonghua (traditional Chinese: æ®éè©±; simplified Chinese: æ®éè¯; pinyin: PÇtÅnghuÃ ; literally "common speech").
  * in Taiwan as Guoyu, and unofficially in Hong Kong as Gwok Yu (traditional Chinese: åèª; simplified Chinese: å½è¯­; pinyin: GuÃ³yÇ; literally "national language").
  * in Malaysia and Singapore as Huayu (traditional Chinese: è¯èª; simplified Chinese: åè¯­; pinyin: HuÃ¡yÇ; literally "Chinese (in a cultural sense) language").

In other parts of the world, the three names are used interchangeably to
varying degrees, Putonghua being the most common.

The name Guoyu received official recognition in 1909, when the Qing Dynasty
determined Standard Mandarin as the "national language". The name Putonghua
also has a long, albeit unofficial, pedigree. It was used as early as 1906 in
writings by Zhu Wenxiong (æ±æç) to differentiate a modern, standard
language from classical Chinese and Chinese dialects.

For some linguists of the early 20th century, the Putonghua, or "common
tongue", was conceptually different from the Guoyu, or "national language".
The former was a national prestige dialect or language, while the latter was
the legal standard. Based on common understandings of the time, the two were,
in fact, different. Guoyu was understood as formal vernacular Chinese, which
is close to classical Chinese. By contrast, Putonghua was called the "the
common speech of the modern man", which is the spoken language adopted as a
national lingua franca by conventional usage. The use of the term Putonghua by
left-leaning intellectuals such as Qu Qiubai and Lu Xun influenced the
People's Republic of China government to adopt that term to describe Standard
Mandarin in 1956. Prior to this, the government used both terms
interchangeably.[3]

Huayu, or "language of the Chinese nation", originally simply meant "Chinese
language", and was used in overseas communities to contrast Chinese dialects
against foreign languages. Over time, the desire to standardise the variety of
Chinese spoken in these communities led to the adoption of the name "Huayu" to
refer to standard Mandarin. This name also avoids choosing a side between the
alternative names of Putonghua and Guoyu, which came to have political
significance after their usages diverged along political lines between the PRC
and the ROC. It also incorporates the notion that Mandarin is usually not the
national or common language of the areas in which overseas Chinese live.

## [edit] History

Main article: History of Standard Mandarin

Chinese languages have always had dialects; hence prestige dialects have
always existed, and linguae francae have always been needed. Confucius, for
example, used yÇyÃ¡n (é è¨), or "elegant speech", rather than colloquial
regional dialects; text during the Han Dynasty also referred to tÅngyÇ
(éè¯­), or "common language". Rime books, which were written since the
Southern and Northern Dynasties, may also have reflected one or more systems
of standard pronunciation during those times. However, all of these standard
dialects were probably unknown outside the educated elite; even among the
elite, pronunciations may have been very different, as the unifying factor of
all Chinese dialects, Classical Chinese, was a written standard, not a spoken
one.

The Ming Dynasty (1368â1644) and the Qing Dynasty (1644â1912) began to use
the term guÄnhuÃ  (å®è¯), or "official speech", to refer to the speech used
at the courts. The term "Mandarin" comes directly from the Portuguese. The
word mandarim was first used to name the Chinese bureaucratic officials (i.e.,
the mandarins), because the Portuguese, under the misapprehension that the
Sanskrit word (mantri or mentri) that was used throughout Asia to denote "an
official" had some connection with the Portuguese word mandar (to order
somebody to do something), and having observed that these officials all
"issued orders", chose to call them mandarins. From this, the Portuguese
immediately started calling the special language that these officials spoke
amongst themselves (i.e., "Guanhua") "the language of the mandarins", "the
mandarin language" or, simply, "Mandarin". The fact that Guanhua was, to a
certain extent, an artificial language, based upon a set of conventions (that
is, the various Mandarin dialects for grammar and meaning, and the specific
dialect of the Imperial Court's locale for its pronunciation), is precisely
what makes it such an appropriate term for Modern Standard Chinese (also the
various Mandarin dialects for grammar and meaning, and their dialect of
Beijing for its pronunciation).

It seems that during the early part of this period, the standard was based on
the Nanjing dialect of Mandarin, but later the Beijing dialect became
increasingly influential, despite the mix of officials and commoners speaking
various dialects in the capital, Beijing. In the 17th century, the Empire had
set up Orthoepy Academies (æ­£é³æ¸é¢ ZhÃ¨ngyÄ«n ShÅ«yuÃ n) in an attempt to
make pronunciation conform to the Beijing standard. But these attempts had
little success since as late as the 19th century the emperor had difficulty
understanding some of his own ministers in court, who did not always try to
follow any standard pronunciation. Although by some account, as late as the
early 20th century, the position of Nanjing Mandarin was considered to be
higher than that of Beijing by some and the Chinese Postal Map Romanization
standards set in 1906 included spellings with elements of Nanjing
pronunciation.[4] Nevertheless, by 1909, the dying Qing Dynasty had
established the Beijing dialect as guÃ³yÇ (å½è¯­), or the "national
language".

After the Republic of China was established in 1912, there was more success in
promoting a common national language. A Commission on the Unification of
Pronunciation was convened with delegates from the entire country. At first
there was an attempt to introduce a standard pronunciation with elements from
regional dialects. But this was deemed too difficult to promote, and in 1924
this attempt was abandoned and the Beijing dialect became the major source of
standard national pronunciation, due to the status of that dialect as a
prestigious dialect since the Qing Dynasty. Elements from other dialects
continue to exist in the standard language, but as exceptions rather than the
rule.

The People's Republic of China, established in 1949, continued the effort. In
1955, the name guÃ³yÇ was replaced by pÇtÅnghuÃ  (æ®éè¯), or "common
speech". (By contrast, the name guÃ³yÇ continued to be used by the Republic
of China which, after the 1949 loss in the Chinese Civil War, had a territory
consisting of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu Islands, and smaller islands)
Since then, the standards used in mainland China and Taiwan have diverged
somewhat, especially in newer vocabulary terms, and a little in pronunciation.

The advent of the 20th century has seen many profound changes in Standard
Mandarin. Many formal, polite and humble words that were in use in imperial
China have almost entirely disappeared in daily conversation in modern-day
Standard Mandarin, such as jiÃ n (è´± "my humble") and guÃ¬ (è´µ "your
honorable").

The word 'Putonghua' was defined in October 1955 by the Minister of Education
Department in mainland China as follows: "Putonghua is the common spoken
language of the modern Han group, the lingua franca of all ethnic groups in
the country. The standard pronunciation of Putonghua is based on the Beijing
dialect, Putonghua is based on the Northern dialects [i.e. the Mandarin
dialects], and the grammar policy is modeled after the vernacular used in
modern Chinese literary classics" [5].

In both China and Taiwan, the use of Standard Mandarin as the medium of
instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the
spread of Standard Mandarin. In Taiwan, all other languages, including Minnan,
Hakka, Aboriginal languages, and Japanese were banned from school, the media,
and official use. As a result, Standard Mandarin is now spoken fluently by
most people in China and in Taiwan.

In Hong Kong and Macau, which are now special administrative regions of the
People's Republic of China, Standard Cantonese has been the primary language
spoken by the majority of the population, due to historical and linguistic
reasons. After Hong Kong's handover from Britain and Macau's handover from
Portugal, Standard Mandarin has become only slightly more understood (but
still not widely spoken) and is used by the governments of the two territories
to communicate with the Central People's Government of China. In fact, many
students from Hong Kong and Macau go to China or Taiwan to study Standard
Mandarin. Cantonese remains the official government language of Hong Kong and
Macau when not communicating with China.

## [edit] Phonology

This article contains IPA phonetic symbols. Without proper rendering support,
you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Unicode
characters.  
The standardized phonology of Standard Mandarin is reproduced below. Actual
reproduction varies widely among speakers, as everyone (including national
leaders) inadvertently introduces elements of his/her own native dialect. By
contrast, television and radio announcers are chosen for their pronunciation
accuracy and "neutral" accent.

### [edit] Initials

The following is the initial inventory of Standard Mandarin as represented in
the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):

Bilabial Labio-  
dental Alveolar Retroflex Alveolo-  
palatal Velar  
Nasal m n Å  
Plosive p pÊ° t tÊ° k kÊ°  
Affricate ts tsÊ° ÊÊ ÊÊÊ° tÉ tÉÊ°  
Fricative f s Ê (Ê)1 É x  
Approximant l É»1 j É¥ w  
1 /É»/ is often transcribed as [Ê] (a voiced retroflex fricative). This
represents a variation in pronunciation among different speakers, rather than
two different phonemes.

Corresponding chart in:

  * Pinyin
  * Zhuyin
  * Gwoyeu Romatzyh

For more complete information, showing how initials and finals interact, see
this zhuyin-IPA chart. The vowel sounds in that chart have been verified
against the official IPA: site. A table of valid initial and final
combinations can also be seen at:

  * Pinyin table
  * Zhuyin table

What are traditionally termed retroflex are phonetically not true retroflex
articulations. These consonants are, rather, flat apical postalveolar, and
thus differ from both palatoalveolar and (true) retroflex consonants
(Ladefoged & Wu 1984; Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:150-154).

The alveolo-palatal consonants /tÉ tÉÊ° É/ are in complementary
distribution (see minimal pair) with the alveolar consonants /ts tsÊ° s/,
retroflex consonants /tÊ tÊÊ° Ê/ and velar consonants /k kÊ° x/. As a
result, linguists prefer to classify /tÉ tÉÊ° É/ as allophones of one of
the three other sets. The Yale and Wade-Giles systems, for example, mostly
treat the palatals as allophones of the retroflex consonants; Tongyong Pinyin
mostly treats them as allophones of the alveolars; and Chinese braille treats
them as allophones of the velars.

/tÉ tÉÊ° É/ may be pronounced as [tsj tsÊ°j sj], which is characteristic of
the speech of young women, and also of some men. This is usually considered
rather effeminate and may also be considered substandard.

The null initial, written as an apostrophe word-medially or -finally, is most
commonly realized as [É°], though [n], [Å], [É£], and [Ê] are common in
other dialects of Mandarin; some of these correspond to null in the Standard
Mandarin but contrast with it in their dialect.[citation needed]

### [edit] Finals

The final, or rime, of a syllable, in Standard Mandarin, is the part after the
initial consonant. A Mandarin final can be structurally described as
(Vm)V(Cf). In other words, it consists of an optional medial, a nucleus, and
an optional coda. When present, the medial can be one of the three glides
corresponding to the three high vowels: /i/, /u/, /y/. The coda can be absent;
it can be one of two glides: /i/ and /u/; or it can be one of two nasals: /n/,
/Å/.

Not counting tone distinctions, there are about 35 distinct finals in
Mandarin.

There are at least the following phones:

  * [a] (only in finals [a], [ia], [ua], [ya], [ai], [uai], [uan])
  * [É] (only in finals [ÉÊ], [iÉÊ], [ÉÅ], [iÉÅ], [uÉÅ])
  * [e] (only in finals [ei] and [uei])
  * [É] (only in finals [iÉ], [iÉn], [yÉn] and in the isolated word [É])
  * [Å] (only in final [yÅ])
  * [o] (only in finals [ou] and [iou])
  * [É] (only in final [uÉ] and in the isolated word [É])
  * [É] (only in finals [Én], [uÉn], [ÉÅ], [uÉÅ])
  * [É¤] (only in final [É¤])
  * [zÌ©] (only in final [zÌ©], which occurs only after alveolar sibilants; sometimes pronounced as [É¨])
  * [ÊÌ©] (only in final [ÊÌ©Ì©], which occurs only after retroflex sibilants; sometimes pronounced as [É¨])
  * [i] (only in finals [i], [in], [iÅ])
  * [Ê] (only in finals [ÊÅ], [yÊÅ])
  * [u] (only in final [u])
  * [y] (only in final [y], [yn])

This shows fourteen different vowels. By very conservative standards, this
represents a system of eight phonemes: /a/ ([a]/[É]), /e/ ([e]/[É]/[Å]),
/o/ ([o]/[É]), /É/ ([É]/[É¤]), /zÌ©/ ([zÌ©]/[ÊÌ©]), /i/ ([i]), /u/
([Ê]/[u]), and /y/ ([y]).

Further reduction can be achieved by noticing that /e/, /o/, and /É/ are in
complementary distribution, and can be treated as a single phoneme /É/.
Exceptions are the isolated words [É] and [É], which function only as
exclamations and can be treated as outside of the core system (similar to the
normal treatment of "hmm", "unh-unh", "shhh!" and other English exclamations
that violate usual syllabic constraints). Note also that the finals [iÉn] can
be considered to be phonemically either /iÉn/ or /ian/; likewise for [yÉn],
which can be either /yÉn/ or /yan/. (Taking into account that [iÉn] and
[yÉn] become [iaÉ»] and [yaÉ»] upon rhoticization, the latter interpretation
seems more likely.) It would also be possible to merge /zÌ©/ and /i/, provided
that the alveolo-palatal and retroflex series are not themselves merged, since
/i/ does not occur after retroflex or velar sounds or after alveolar
fricatives and affricates. If all of these suggestions are followed, and
[iÉn] and [yÉn] considered to be /ian/ and /yan/, the resulting system of
/a/, /É/, /i/, /u/, and /y/ is much like the standard pinyin romanization
scheme (except that pinyin does not merge /É/ with /o/ and uses a certain
number of shortcut spellings).

An even more reduced system results from considering main vowel /i/, /u/ and
/y/ to be the surface results of the respective glides combined with a null
meta-phoneme. This system, shown below, analyzes the final part of a syllable
as a combination of a glide slot (/i/, /u/, /y/ or null), a main vowel slot
(/a/, /É/ or null), and a coda slot (/i/, /u/, /n/, /Å/ or null). (The
minimal vowel /zÌ©/ ([zÌ©]/[ÊÌ©] or [É¨]) is considered to be the surface
manifestation when all three slots are null, rather than an allophone of main
vowel /i/.)

When the medial, nucleus, and coda combine into a final, their pronunciations
may be affected. The following is the full table of finals of Standard
Mandarin in the IPA:

Nucleus Coda Medial  
Ã i u y  
a Ã a ia ua  
i ai uai  
u ÉÊ iÉÊ  
n an iÉn uan yÉn  
Å ÉÅ iÉÅ uÉÅ  
É Ã É¤ iÉ uo 1 yÉ Â²  
i ei uei  
u É¤Ê iÉ¤Ê  
n Én in uÉn yn  
Å É¤Å iÅ uÉ¤Å Â³ yÊÅ  
Ã zÌ© i u y  
1 Both pinyin and zhuyin have an additional "o", used after "b p m f", which
is distinguished from "uo", used after everything else. "o" is generally put
into the first column instead of the third. However, in Beijing pronunciation,
these are identical.  
Â² Another way to represent the four finals of this line is: [É¯Ê iÉ uÉ
yÅ], which reflects Beijing pronunciation.  
Â³ /uÉ¤Å/ is pronounced [ÊÅ] when it follows an initial.

### [edit] R Finals

Main article: Erhua

Standard Mandarin also uses a rhotic consonant, /É/. This usage is a unique
feature of Standard Mandarin; other dialects lack this sound. In Chinese, this
feature is known as Erhua. There are two cases in which it is used:

  1. In a small number of words, such as äº Ã¨r "two", è³ Är "ear", etc. All of these words are pronounced as [ÉÉ] with no initial consonant.
  2. As a noun suffix -å /-å¿ -r. The suffix combines with the final, and regular but complex changes occur as a result.

The "r" final must be distinguished from the retroflex semi-vowel written as
<ri> in the pinyin spelling and represented either by <Ê> or <É»> in IPA.
"The star rode a donkey" in some rhotic English accents, and æå¥³å å
¥é«é¢/æå¥³å¿å ¥å»é¢ WÇ nÇ'Ã©r rÃ¹ yÄ«yuÃ n "My daughter entered the
hospital" in standard Mandarin, both have a first r pronounced with a
relatively lax tongue, whereas the second /r/ sounds involves a very active
curling of the tongue and contact with the top of the mouth.

In other dialects of Mandarin, the rhotic consonant is sometimes replaced by
another syllable, such as li, in words that indicate locations. For example,
éå /è¿å¿ zhÃ¨r "here" and é£å /é£å¿ nÃ r "there" become éè£¡/è¿é
zhÃ¨li and é£è£¡/é£é nÃ li, respectively.

### [edit] The "ki-" sequence

Until a few centuries ago, some Mandarin Chinese words started with the sound
sequence "ki-" or "gi-" (Wade-Giles "k'i-" and "ki-"). This changed in the
last two or three centuries to "chi-" and "ji-", at varying times in different
areas, and not in the dialect used in the Manchu dynasty imperial court. That
is why some European transcriptions of Chinese names contain "ki-". Examples
are Peking for Beijing, Nanking, Chungking, "-kiang" for "-jiang" (= "river"),
Fukien for Fujian (a province).

### [edit] Tones

<IMG>

<IMG>

Relative pitch changes of the four tones

Mandarin, like all Chinese dialects, is a tonal language. This means that
tones, just like consonants and vowels, are used to distinguish words from
each other. Many foreigners have difficulties mastering the tones of each
character, but correct tonal pronunciation is essential for intelligibility
because of the vast number of characters in the language that only differ by
tone (i.e. are minimal pairs with respect to tone). The following are the 4
tones of Standard Mandarin:

Tone chart of Standard Mandarin Tone name Yin Ping Yang Ping Shang Qu  
Tone number 1 2 3 4  
Pinyin diacritic Ä Ã¡ Ç Ã  
Tone letter Ë¥ (55) Ë§Ë¥ (35) Ë©, Ë¨Ë©Ë¦ (1, 214) Ë¥Ë© (51)  
IPA diacritic Ã¡ Ç Ã , aá· Ã¢  
  1. First tone, or high-level tone (é°å¹³/é´å¹³ yÄ«npÃ­ng, literal meaning: yin-level): 
    a steady high sound, as if it were being sung instead of spoken.
  2. Second tone, or rising tone (é½å¹³/é³å¹³ yÃ¡ngpÃ­ng, literal meaning: yang-level), or linguistically, high-rising: 
    is a sound that rises from mid-level tone to high (e.g., What?!)
  3. Third tone (low or dipping tone, ä¸è²/ä¸å£° shÇngshÄng or shÃ ngshÄng, literal meaning: "up tone"): 
    has a mid-low to low descent; if at the end of a sentence or before a pause, it is then followed by a rising pitch. Between other tones it may simply be low.
  4. Fourth tone, falling tone (å»è²/å»å£° qÃ¹shÄng, literal meaning: "away tone"), or high-falling: 
    features a sharp fall from high to low, and is a shorter tone, similar to curt commands. (e.g., Stop!)

The nature of these four tones are actually slured musical pitches.

#### [edit] Neutral tone

Also called Fifth tone or zeroth tone (in Chinese: è¼è²/è½»å£° qÄ«ng shÄng,
literal meaning: "light tone"), neutral tone is sometimes thought of as a lack
of tone. It usually comes at the end of a word or phrase, and is pronounced in
a light and short manner. The neutral tone has a large number of allotones:
Its pitch depends almost entirely on the tone carried by the syllable
preceding it. The situation is further complicated by the amount of dialectal
variation associated with it; in some regions, notably Taiwan, the neutral
tone is relatively uncommon.

Despite many examples of minimal pairs (for example, è¦æ¯ and é¥å, yÃ
oshÃ¬ if and yÃ oshi key, respectively), it is sometimes described as
something other than a full-fledged tone for technical reasons: Namely because
some linguists feel that it results from a "spreading out" of the tone on the
preceding syllable. This idea is appealing intuitively because without it, the
neutral tone requires relatively complex tone sandhi rules to be made sense
of; indeed, it would have to have 4 separate allotones, one for each of the
four tones that could precede it. However, the "spreading" theory incompletely
characterizes the neutral tone, especially in sequences where more than one
neutrally toned syllable are found adjacent[6].

The following are from Beijing dialect[7]. Other dialects may be slightly
different.

Realization of neutral tones Tone of first syllable Pitch of neutral tone
Example Pinyin English meaning  
1 Ë¥ Ë¨ (2) ç»ç (Ë¥.Ë¨) bÅli glass  
2 Ë§Ë¥ Ë§ (3) ä¼¯ä¼¯ (Ë§Ë¥.Ë§) bÃ³bo uncle  
3 Ë¨Ë© Ë¦ (4) åå­ (Ë¨Ë©.Ë¦) lÇba horn  
4 Ë¥Ë© Ë© (1) å å­ (Ë¥Ë©.Ë©) tÃ¹zi rabbit  
Most romanizations represent the tones as diacritics on the vowels (e.g.,
Hanyu Pinyin, MPS II and Tongyong Pinyin). Zhuyin uses diacritics as well.
Others, like Wade-Giles, use superscript numbers at the end of each syllable.
The tone marks and numbers are rarely used outside of language textbooks.
Gwoyeu Romatzyh is a rare example where tones are not represented as special
symbols, but using normal letters of the alphabet (although without a one-to-
one correspondence).

To listen to the tones, see
http://www.wku.edu/~shizhen.gao/Chinese101/pinyin/tones.htm (click on the
blue-red yin yang symbol).

#### [edit] Tone sandhi

Pronunciation also varies with context according to the rules of tone sandhi.
The most prominent phenomenon of this kind is when there are two third tones
in immediate sequence, in which case the first of them changes to a rising
tone, the second tone. In the literature, this contour is often called two-
thirds tone or half-third tone, though generally, in Standard Mandarin, the
"two-thirds tone" is the same as the second tone. If there are three third
tones in series, the tone sandhi rules become more complex, and depend on word
boundaries, stress, and dialectal variations.

##### [edit] Tone sandhi rules at a glance

  1. When there are two 3rd tones (Ë¨Ë©Ë¦) in a row, the first syllable becomes 2nd tone (Ë§Ë¥), and the second syllable becomes half-3rd tone (Ë¨Ë©). 
    ex: èé¼  (lÇoshÇ) becomes [laoË§Ë¥ÊuË¨Ë©]
  2. When there are three 3rd tones in a row, things get more complicated. 
    If the first word is two syllables, and the second word is one syllable, the first two syllables become 2nd tones, and the last syllable stays 3rd tone: 
    ex: ä¿ç®¡å¥½ (bÇoguÇn hÇo) becomes [paoË§Ë¥kuanË§Ë¥xaoË¨Ë©Ë¦]
    If the first word is one syllable, and the second word is two syllables, the first syllable becomes half-3rd tone (Ë¨Ë©), the second syllable becomes 2nd tone, and the last syllable stays 3rd tone: 
    ex: èä¿ç®¡ (lÇo bÇoguÇn) becomes [laoË¨Ë©paoË§Ë¥kuanË¨Ë©Ë¦]
  3. When a 3rd tone is followed by a first, second or fourth tone, or most neutral tone syllables, it usually becomes a half-3rd tone. The half-3rd tone is a tone that only falls but does not rise. 
    ex: ç¾å¦ (mÄimiÃ o) becomes [meiË¨Ë©miaoË¥Ë©]

##### [edit] Rules for "ä¸" and "ä¸"

"ä¸" (yÄ«) and "ä¸" (bÃ¹) have special rules which do not apply to other
Chinese characters:

  1. When in front of a 4th tone syllable, "ä¸" becomes 2nd tone. 
    ex: ä¸å® (yÄ«dÃ¬ng becomes yÃ­dÃ¬ng [iË§Ë¥tiÅË¥Ë©])
  2. When in front of a non-4th tone syllable, "ä¸" becomes 4th tone. 
    ex. (1st tone)ï¼ä¸å¤© (yÄ«tiÄn â yÃ¬tiÄn [iË¥Ë©tÊ°iÉnË¥Ë¥])
    ex. (2nd tone): ä¸å¹´ (yÄ«niÃ¡n â yÃ¬niÃ¡n [iË¥Ë©niÉnË§Ë¥])
    ex. (3rd tone): ä¸èµ· (yÄ«qÇ â yÃ¬qÇ [iË¥Ë©tÉÊ°iË¨Ë©Ë¦])
  3. When "ä¸" falls between two words, it becomes neutral tone. 
    ex: çä¸ç (kÃ nyÄ«kÃ n) becomes kÃ nyikÃ n
  4. When counting sequentially, and for all other situations "ä¸" retains its root tone value of 1st tone. This includes when ä¸ is used at the end of a multi-syllable word (regardless of the first tone of the next word), and when ä¸ is immediately followed by any digit, including another ä¸; hence ä¸ also retains its root tone value of 1st tone in both syllables of the word "ä¸ä¸". However, it does not include situations where ä¸ä¸ is part of a longer word like ä¸ä¸å¯¹åº or ä¸ä¸å¦å½ (these are pronounced yÃ¬yÃ­duÃ¬yÃ¬ng and yÃ­yÃ¬rÃºmÃ¬ng, although written yÄ«yÄ«duÃ¬yÃ¬ng and yÄ«yÄ«rÃºmÃ¬ng). The word ä¸ä¸ä¸ (meaning "I won't go into details") is pronounced differently depending on whether or not speakers interpret it as containing ä¸ä¸ as a component word.
  5. When ä¸ is part of a cardinal number, it is pronounced as 4th tone when before å or ç¾, but in an ordinal number it is pronounced as 1st tone in these contexts.
  6. "ä¸" becomes 2nd tone only when followed by a 4th tone syllable. 
    ex: ä¸æ¯ (bÃ¹shÃ¬) becomes [puË§Ë¥ÊË¥Ë©]
  7. When "ä¸" comes between two words, it loses its tone (becomes neutral in tone). 
    ex: æ¯ä¸æ¯ (shÃ¬bÃ¹shÃ¬) becomes shÃ¬bushÃ¬

#### [edit] Relationship between Middle Chinese and modern tones

Relationship between Middle Chinese and modern tones:

V- = unvoiced initial consonant  
L = sonorant initial consonant  
V+ = voiced initial consonant (not sonorant)

Middle Chinese Tone Ping (å¹³) Shang (ä¸) Qu (å») Ru (å ¥)  
Middle Chinese Initial V- L V+ V- L V+ V- L V+ V- L V+  
Standard Mandarin Tone name Yin Ping  
(é°å¹³, 1) Yang Ping  
(é½å¹³, 2) Shang  
(ä¸, 3) Qu  
(å», 4) redistributed  
with no pattern to Qu to Yang Ping  
Standard Mandarin Tone contour 55 35 214 51 to 51 to 35  
It is known that if the two morphemes of a compound word cannot be ordered by
grammar, the order of the two is usually determined by tones â Yin Ping (1),
Yang Ping (2), Shang (3), Qu (4), and Ru, which is the plosive-ending tone
that has already disappeared. Below are some compound words that show this
rule. Tones are shown in parentheses, and R indicates Ru.

### [edit] Word stress

The stress pattern of Chinese language is made up of three degrees of stress.
There are three stress patterns, which commonly occur in the two-syllable
compound words[8]:

    Pattern One: Normal Stress + Primary Stress (\ + /)
    Pattern Two: Primary Stress + Unstressed (/ + o)
    Pattern Three: Primary Stress + Normal Stress (/ + \\)
    Pattern One \ + /

## [edit] Standard Mandarin and Beijing dialect

Due to evolution and standardization, Standard Mandarin, although based on the
Beijing dialect, is no longer synonymous with it. Part of this was due to the
standardization of Mandarin to reflect a greater vocabulary scheme and a more
archaic and "proper-sounding" pronunciation and vocabulary. The areas near
Beijing, especially the cities of Chengde and Shijiazhuang in neighbouring
Hebei province, speak a form of Mandarin closest to its fully standardized
pronunciation; this form is generally heard on national and local television
and radio.

By the official definition of the People's Republic of China, Standard
Mandarin uses:

  * The phonology or sound system of Beijing. A distinction should be made between the sound system of a dialect or language and the actual pronunciation of words in it. The pronunciations of words chosen for Standard Mandarin -- a standardized speech -- do not necessarily reproduce all of those of the Beijing dialect. The pronunciation of words is a standardization choice and occasional standardization differences (not accents) do exist, between Putonghua and Guoyu, for example.

In fluent speech, Chinese speakers can easily tell the difference between a
speaker of the Beijing dialect and a speaker of Standard Mandarin. Beijingers
speak Standard Mandarin with elements of their own dialect in the same way as
other speakers.

  * The vocabulary of Mandarin dialects in general. This means that all slang and other elements deemed "regionalisms" are excluded. On the one hand, the vocabulary of all Chinese dialects, especially in more technical fields like science, law, and government, are very similar. (This is similar to the profusion of Latin and Greek words in European languages.) This means that much of the vocabulary of standardized Mandarin is shared with all varieties of Chinese. On the other hand, much of the colloquial vocabulary and slang found in Beijing dialect is not found in Standard Mandarin, and may not be understood by people outside Beijing.
  * The grammar and usage of exemplary modern Chinese literature, such as the work of Lu Xun, collectively known as "Vernacular Chinese" (baihua). Vernacular Chinese, the standard written form of modern Chinese, is in turn based loosely upon a mixture of northern (predominant), southern, and classical grammar and usage. This gives formal standard Mandarin structure a slightly different feel from that of street Beijing dialect.

In theory the Republic of China in Taiwan defines standard Mandarin
differently, though in reality the differences are minor and are concentrated
mostly in the tones of a small minority of words.

Speakers of Standard Mandarin generally have little difficulty understanding
the Beijing accent, which the former is based on. Natives of Beijing commonly
add a final "er" (/É»/) (å é³/å¿é³; pinyin: Ã©ryÄ«n) â commonly used as
a diminutive â to vocabulary items, as well as use more neutral tones in
their speech. An example of Standard Mandarin versus the Beijing dialect would
be: standard men (door) compared with Beijing menr. These give the Beijing
dialect a somewhat distinctive lilt compared to Standard Mandarin spoken
elsewhere. The dialect is also known for its rich colloquialisms and idiomatic
expressions.

Although Chinese speakers make a clear distinction between Standard Mandarin
and the Beijing dialect, there are aspects of Beijing dialect that have made
it into the official standard. Standard Mandarin has a T-V distinction between
the polite and informal versions of you that comes from Beijing dialect, but
its use is quite diminished in daily speech. In addition, there is a
distinction between "zÃ¡nmen" (we including the listener) and "wÇmen" (we not
including the listener). In practice, neither distinction is commonly used by
most Chinese.

The following samples are some phrases from Beijing dialect which are not yet
accepted into Standard Mandarin:

åå¿: bÃ¨ir means 'very much'; æè: bÃ n suÃ n means 'stagger'; ä¸å:
bÃ¹ lÃ¬n means 'do not worry about'; æ®: cuÅ means 'eat'; åºæº: chÅ« liÅ«
means 'slip'; å¤§èç·å¿ä»¬å¿: dÃ lÄo yer menr means 'man, male';

The following samples are some phrases from Beijing dialect which have been
already accepted as Standard Mandarin in recent years. äºæå: Ã¨r bÄ dÄo
means 'not very skillful'; å¥ä»¬å¿: gÄ mÃ©nr means 'good male friends',
"buddies"; æ é¨å¿: kÅu mÃ©nr means 'parsimony'.

## [edit] Standard Mandarin and other dialects and languages

Although Standard Mandarin is now firmly established as the lingua franca in
Mainland China, the national standard can be somewhat different from the other
dialects in the vast Mandarin dialect chain, to the point of being to some
extent unintelligible. However, pronunciation differences within the Mandarin
dialects are usually regular, usually differing only in the tones. For
example, the character for "sky" å¤© is pronounced with the high level tone in
the Beijing dialect and in Standard Mandarin (pinyin: tian), but is the
falling tone in the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin. In languages other than
Mandarin it can range from ti (with a light tone in the Shanghainese dialect
of Wu) to teen in the high level or high falling tone in Standard Cantonese.

Although both Mainland China and Taiwan use Standard Mandarin in the official
context and are keen to promote its use as a national lingua franca, there is
no official intent to have Standard Mandarin replace the regional
languages.[citation needed] As a practical matter, speaking only Standard
Mandarin in areas such as in southern China or Taiwan can be a social
handicap,[citation needed] as some elderly or rural Chinese-language speakers
do not speak Standard Mandarin fluently (although most do understand it). In
addition, it is very common for it to be spoken with the speaker's regional
accent, depending on factors as age, level of education, and the need and
frequency to speak correctly for official or formal purposes. This situation
appears to be changing, though, in large urban centers, as social changes,
migrations, and urbanization take place.

In the predominantly Han areas in Mainland China, while the use of Standard
Mandarin is encouraged as the common working language, the PRC has been
sensitive to the status of minority languages and has not discouraged their
use.[citation needed] Standard Mandarin is very commonly used for logistical
reasons,[citation needed] as in many parts of southern China the linguistic
diversity is so large that neighboring city dwellers may have difficulties
communicating with each other without a lingua franca.

In Taiwan, the relationship between Standard Mandarin and local languages,
particularly Taiwanese, has been more heated. During the dictatorship of the
Kuomintang (KMT) from 1949 until the lifting of martial law in 1987, the KMT
government discouraged or even forbade the use of Taiwanese and other local
vernaculars. This produced a backlash in the 1990s, amongst the general
Taiwanese populace. Under the administration of Chen Shui-Bian, the Taiwanese
languages were taught as an individual class, with dedicated textbooks and
course materials. The former President, Chen Shui-Bian, often broke out into
Taiwanese during speeches, while former President Lee Teng-hui, also speaks
Taiwanese openly when interviewed in the media.

In Singapore, the government has heavily promoted a "Speak Mandarin Campaign"
since the late 1970s. The use of other Chinese languages in broadcast media is
prohibited and their use in any context is officially discouraged. This has
led to some resentment amongst the older generations, as Singapore's migrant
Chinese community is made up almost entirely of south Chinese descent. Lee
Kuan Yew, the initiator of the campaign, admitted that to most Chinese
Singaporeans, Mandarin was a "stepmother tongue" rather than a true mother
language. Nevertheless, he saw the need for a unified language among the
Chinese community not biased in favor of any existing group.[9]

### [edit] Accents

Most Chinese (Beijingers included) speak Standard Mandarin with elements of
their own dialects (i.e. their "accents") mixed in.

For example, natives of Beijing, add a final "er" (/É»/) â commonly used as
a diminutive â sound to vocabulary items that other speakers would leave
unadorned (å é³/å¿é³; pinyin: Ã©ryÄ«n).

On the other hand, speakers from northeastern and southern China as well as
Taiwan often mix up zh and z, ch and c, q and c, sh and s, x and s, h and f,
and l and n because their own home dialects often do not make these
distinctions. As a result, it can be difficult for people who do not have the
standard pronunciation to use pinyin, because they do not distinguish these
sounds.

See List of Chinese dialects for a list of articles on individual dialects of
Chinese languages and how their features differ from Standard Mandarin.

## [edit] Role of standard Mandarin

From an official point of view, Standard Mandarin serves the purpose of a
lingua franca â a way for speakers of the several mutually unintelligible
Han Chinese languages, as well as the Han and Chinese minorities, to
communicate with each other. The very name Putonghua, or "common speech",
reinforces this idea. In practice, however, due to Standard Mandarin being a
"public" lingua franca, other languages or dialects, both Han and non-Han,
have shown signs of losing ground to Standard Mandarin, to the chagrin of
certain local culture proponents.

On Taiwan, Guoyu (national language) continues to be the official term for
standard Mandarin. The term Guoyu is rarely used in Mainland China, because
declaring a Beijing-dialect-based standard to be the national language would
be deemed unfair to other Chinese dialects and ethnic minorities. The term
Putonghua (common speech), on the contrary, implies nothing more than the
notion of a lingua franca. However, the term Guoyu does persist among many
older Mainland Chinese, and it is common in U.S. Chinese communities, even
among Mainlanders. Some in Taiwan, especially proponents of Taiwan
independence, also object to the term Guoyu to refer to standardized Mandarin,
on the grounds that the "nation" referred to in the name of the language is
China and that Taiwan is or should be independent. They prefer to refer to
Mandarin with the terms "Beijing dialect" or Zhongwen (writing of China). As
with most things political in Taiwan, some support the name for precisely the
same reasons that others oppose them.

In December 2004, the first survey of language use in the People's Republic of
China revealed that only 53% of its population, about 700 million people,
could communicate in Standard Mandarin. (China Daily) A survey by South China
Morning Post released in September 2006 gave the same result.[citation needed]
This 53% is defined as a passing grade above 3-B (i.e. error rate lower than
40%) of the Evaluation Exam. Another survey in 2003 by the China National
Language And Character Working Committee (å½å®¶è¯­è¨æå­å·¥ä½å§åä¼)
shows, if mastery of Standard Mandarin is defined as Grade 1-A (an error rate
lower than 3%), the percentages as follows are: Beijing 90%, Shanghai 3%,
Tianjin 25%, Guangzhou 0.5%, Dalian 10%, Xi'an 12%, Chengdu 1%, Nanjing
2%.[citation needed] Consequently, foreign learners of Mandarin usually opt to
learn at Beijing, although learning grammar and writing is not confined to
that area.

With the fast development of China, more Chinese people leaving rural areas
for cities for job or study opportunities, and the Mandarin Level Evaluation
Exam (æ®éè¯æ°´å¹³æµè¯) has quickly become popular. Most university
graduates take this exam before looking for a job. Many companies require a
basic Mandarin Level Evaluation Certificate from their applicants, barring
applicants who were born or bred in Beijing, since their Proficiency level is
believed to be inherently 1-A (ä¸çº§ç²ç­)(Error rate: lower than 3%). As
for the rest, the score of 1-A is rare. People who get 1-B (Error rate: lower
than 8%) are considered qualified to work as television correspondents or in
broadcasting stations. 2-A (Error rate: lower than 13%) can work as Chinese
Literature Course teachers in public schools. Other levels include: 2-B (Error
rate: lower than 20%), 3-A (Error rate: lower than 30%) and 3-B (Error rate:
lower than 40%). In China, a proficiency of level 3-B usually cannot be
achieved unless special training is received. Even if most Chinese do not
speak Standard Mandarin with standard pronunciation, spoken Standard Mandarin
is understood by virtually everyone.[citation needed]

The China National Language And Character Working Committee was founded in
1985. One of its important responsibilities is to promote Standard Mandarin
and Mandarin Level proficiency for Chinese native speakers. (Its website link
