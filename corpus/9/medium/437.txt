Crypto-anarchism is an ideology that expounds the use of strong public-key
cryptography to enforce privacy and individual freedom. It was described by
Vernor Vinge as a cyberspatial realization of anarcho-capitalism.[1] Crypto-
anarchists aim to create cryptographic software that can be used to evade
prosecution and harassment while sending and receiving information in computer
networks. Timothy C. May wrote about crypto anarchism in Cyphernomicon:

â What emerges from this is unclear, but I think it will be a form of
anarcho-capitalist market system I call "crypto-anarchy."[2] â  
Using such software, the connection between the identity of a certain user or
organisation and the pseudonym they use is almost entirely unprovable, unless
the user reveals the connection. It is difficult to say which country's laws
will be ignored, as even the location of a certain participant is unknown. In
a sense, the encrypted anonymous networks (the "cipherspace") can be regarded
as an independent, lawless territory. However, participants may in theory
voluntarily create new laws using smart contracts or, if the user is
pseudonymous, depend on online reputation.

## [edit] Motives

One motive of crypto-anarchists is to defend against surveillance of computer
networks communication. They try to protect against things like
telecommunications data retention, the NSA warrantless surveillance
controversy and Room 641A, among other things. Crypto-anarchists consider the
development and use of cryptography to be the main defense against such
problems, as opposed to political action.

A second concern is evasion of censorship, particularly internet censorship,
on the grounds of freedom of expression. The programs used by crypto-
anarchists often make it possible to both publish and read information off the
internet or other computer networks anonymously. Tor, I2P, Freenet and many
similar networks allow for anonymous "hidden" webpages only accessible by
users of these programs. This helps whistleblowers and political opposition in
oppressive nations to spread their information.

Thirdly, the technical challenge in developing these cryptographic systems is
tremendous, which interests some programmers into joining the projects.

### [edit] Criticism and response

Crypto-anarchism is criticized for making it easy for criminals to make use of
the networks to coordinate sabotage and terrorism. Assassination markets is a
good example of the way in which crypto-anarchism could be used to these
ends.[3] Crypto-anarchists acknowledge that such freedom could be abused by
criminals, but claim that criminals are already communicating anonymously, so
that the networks will just bring the benefits of privacy and freedom of
anonymity to ordinary people.

In response to the criticism, crypto-anarchists argue that without the ability
to encrypt messages, personal information and private life would be seriously
damaged. A ban on cryptography is equal of the eradication of secrecy of
correspondence. They argue that only a draconian police-state would
criminalize cryptography. In spite of this, it is already illegal to use it in
some countries, and export laws are restrictive in others. Citizens in England
must, upon request, give passwords for decryption of personal systems to
authorities in England. Failing to do this can result in imprisonment for up
to two years, without the suspicion of committed crimes.[4]

However, as processing power increases, and the computational cost of
generating cryptographic keys decreases, this legislative key-surrender tactic
can be circumvented using automatic rekeying of secure channels through rapid
generation of new, unrelated public and private keys at short intervals.
Following rekeying, the old keys can be deleted, rendering previously-used
keys inaccessible to the end-user, and thus removing the user's ability to
disclose the old key, even if they are willing to do so. Technologies enabling
this sort of rapidly rekeyed encryption include public-key cryptography,
hardware PRNGs, perfect forward secrecy, and opportunistic encryption. The
only way to stop this sort of cryptography is to ban it completely--and any
such ban would be unenforceable for any government that is not totalitarian,
as it would result in massive invasions of privacy, such as blanket permission
for physical searches of all computers at random intervals.

To truly enforce a ban on the use of cryptography is probably impossible, as
cryptography itself can be used to hide even the existence of encrypted
messages (see steganography). It is also possible to encapsulate messages
encrypted with illegal strong cryptography inside messages encrypted with
legal weak cryptography, thus making it very difficult and uneconomical for
outsiders to notice the use of illegal encryption.

## [edit] Plausible deniability

Crypto-anarchism relies heavily on plausible deniability to avoid censorship.
Crypto-anarchists create this deniability by sending encrypted messages to
interlinked proxies in computer networks. With the message a payload of
routing information is bundled. The message is encrypted with each one of the
proxies and the receiver public keys. Each node can only decrypt its own part
of the message, and only obtain the information intended for itself. That is,
which node is the next hop in the chain. Thus, it is impossible for any node
in the chain to know anything else but the previous and next node in the chain
or what information they are carrying to the receiver as those parts of the
information are hidden. The receiver also does not know who the sender is,
except perhaps by another destination, digital signature or something similar.
Who originally sent the information and who is the intended receiver is
considered infeasible to detect. See onion routing for more information.

Thus, with multiple layers of encryption, it is effectively impossible to know
who is connected to any particular service or pseudonym. Because summary
punishment for crimes is mostly illegal, it is impossible to stop any
potential criminal activity in the network without enforcing a ban on strong
cryptography, and this is probably impossible as seen above.

Deniable encryption and anonymizing networks can be used to avoid being
detected while sharing illegal or sensitive information, that users are too
afraid to share on the ordinary Internet. It could be anything from anti-state
propaganda, reports of abuse, whistleblowing, reports from Chinese dissidents
and child pornography.

## [edit] Anonymous trading

Untraceable, privately issued electronic money and anonymous Internet banking
exists in these networks. Digital Monetary Trust and Yodelbank were examples
of two such anonymous banks that are now put offline, eCache is a bank
currently operating in the Tor network, and Pecunix is an anonymous
(submitting personal information when opening an account is optional) gold
bank operating on the Internet. Anonymous trading is easier to achieve for
information services that can be provided over the Internet. For example, the
developers of I2P receive anonymous or pseudonymous monetary support from the
I2P community. Providing physical products is more difficult as the anonymity
is more easily broken when crossing into the physical world. Untraceable money
makes it possible to ignore some of the laws of the physical world, as the
laws cannot be enforced without knowing people's physical identities. For
instance, tax on income for online services provided pseudonymously can be
avoided if no government knows the identity of the service provider.

## [edit] Final note

This should not be confused with the use of the prefix "crypto-" to indicate
an ideology or system with an intentionally concealed or obfuscated "true
nature". For example, some would use the term "crypto-fascist" to describe an
individual or organization that holds fascist views and subscribes to fascist
doctrine but tries to hide this agenda from those outside of itself. However,
Timothy C. May's "Cyphernomicon"[5] indicates that the term "crypto-anarchist"
was partially intended as a pun on this usage, even though he did not intend
to conceal his beliefs or agenda.
