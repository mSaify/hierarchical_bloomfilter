Polystyrene IPA: /ËpÉliËstaÉªriËn/ (IUPAC Poly(1-phenylethane-1,2-diyl)),
sometimes abbreviated PS, is an aromatic polymer made from the aromatic
monomer styrene, a liquid hydrocarbon that is commercially manufactured from
petroleum by the chemical industry. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used
kinds of plastic.

Polystyrene is a thermoplastic substance, normally existing in solid state at
room temperature, but melting if heated (for molding or extrusion), and
becoming solid again when cooling off. Pure solid polystyrene is a colorless,
hard plastic with limited flexibility. It can be cast into molds with fine
detail. Polystyrene can be transparent or can be made to take on various
colors.

Solid polystyrene is used, for example, in disposable cutlery, plastic models,
CD and DVD cases, and smoke detector housings. Products made from foamed
polystyrene are nearly ubiquitous, for example packing materials, insulation,
and foam drinks cups.

Polystyrene can be recycled, and has the number "6" as its recycling symbol.
Unrecycled polystyrene, which does not biodegrade, is often abundant in the
outdoor environment, particularly along shores and waterways, and is a form of
pollution.

## [edit] History

Polystyrene was discovered in 1839 by Eduard Simon,[1] an apothecary in
Berlin. From storax, the resin of the Turkish sweetgum tree (Liquidambar
orientalis), he distilled an oily substance, a monomer which he named styrol.
Several days later, Simon found that the styrol had thickened, presumably from
oxidation, into a jelly he dubbed styrol oxide ("Styroloxyd"). By 1845 English
chemist John Blyth and German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann showed that
the same transformation of styrol took place in the absence of oxygen. They
called their substance metastyrol. Analysis later showed that it was
chemically identical to Styroloxyd. In 1866 Marcelin Berthelot correctly
identified the formation of metastyrol from styrol as a polymerization
process. About 80 years went by before it was realized that heating of styrol
starts a chain reaction which produces macromolecules, following the thesis of
German organic chemist Hermann Staudinger (1881â1965). This eventually led
to the substance receiving its present name, polystyrene.

The company I. G. Farben began manufacturing polystyrene in Ludwigshafen,
Germany, about 1931, hoping it would be a suitable replacement for die-cast
zinc in many applications. Success was achieved when they developed a reactor
vessel that extruded polystyrene through a heated tube and cutter, producing
polystyrene in pellet form.

In 1959, the Koppers Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, developed expanded
polystyrene (EPS) foam.[citation needed]

## [edit] Structure and properties

The chemical makeup of polystyrene is a long chain hydrocarbon with every
other carbon connected to a phenyl group (the name given to the aromatic ring
benzene, when bonded to complex carbon substituents). Polystyrene's chemical
formula is (C8H8)n; it contains the chemical elements carbon and hydrogen.
Because it is an aromatic hydrocarbon, it burns with an orange-yellow flame,
giving off soot, as opposed to non-aromatic hydrocarbon polymers such as
polyethylene, which burn with a light yellow flame (often with a blue tinge)
and no soot. Complete oxidation of polystyrene produces only carbon dioxide
and water vapor.

A 3-D model would show that each of the chiral backbone carbons lies at the
center of a tetrahedron, with its 4 bonds pointing toward the vertices. Say
the -C-C- bonds are rotated so that the backbone chain lies entirely in the
plane of the diagram. From this flat schematic, it is not evident which of the
phenyl (benzene) groups are angled toward us from the plane of the diagram,
and which ones are angled away. The isomer where all of them are on the same
side is called isotactic polystyrene, which is not produced commercially.

polystyrene[2]  
Ordinary atactic polystyrene has these large phenyl groups randomly
distributed on both sides of the chain. This random positioning prevents the
chains from ever aligning with sufficient regularity to achieve any
crystallinity, so the plastic has no melting temperature, Tm. But metallocene-
catalyzed polymerization can produce an ordered syndiotactic polystyrene with
the phenyl groups on alternating sides. This form is highly crystalline with a
Tm of 270 Â°C.

Extruded polystyrene is about as strong as unalloyed aluminium, but much more
flexible and much lighter (1.05 g/cc vs. 2.70 g/cc for aluminium).

Polystyrene is commonly produced in three forms: extruded polystyrene,
expanded polystyrene foam, and extruded polystyrene foam, each with a variety
of applications. Polystyrene copolymers are also produced; these contain one
or more other monomers in addition to styrene. In recent years the expanded
polystyrene composites with cellulose [5] [6] and starch [7] have also been
produced.

Extruded polystyrene foam insulation is sold under the trademark Styrofoam by
Dow Chemical. This term is often used informally for other foamed polystyrene
products.

Polystyrene is used in some polymer-bonded explosives:

Polystyrene PBX examples Name Explosive ingredients Binder ingredients  
PBX-9205 RDX 92% Polystyrene 6%; DOP 2%  
PBX-9007 RDX 90% Polystyrene 9.1%; DOP 0.5%; resin 0.4%  
It is also a component of napalm[8] and a component of most designs of
hydrogen bombs[citation needed].

### [edit] Extruded polystyrene

Extruded polystyrene (PS) is economical, and is used for producing plastic
model assembly kits, plastic cutlery, CD "jewel" cases, smoke detector
housings, license plate frames, and many other objects where a fairly rigid,
economical plastic is desired. Production methods include stamping and
injection molding.

Polystyrene Petri dishes and other laboratory containers such as test tubes
and microplates play an important role in biomedical research and science. For
these uses, articles are almost always made by injection molding, and often
sterilized post-molding, either by irradiation or treatment with ethylene
oxide. Post-mold surface modification, usually with oxygen-rich plasmas, is
often done to introduce polar groups. Much of modern biomedical research
relies on the use of such products; they therefore play a critical role in
pharmaceutical research.[9]

### [edit] Foams

Polystyrene foams are good thermal insulators, and are therefore often used as
building insulation materials, such as in structural insulated panel building
systems. They are also used for non-weight-bearing architectural structures
(such as ornamental pillars).

#### [edit] Expanded polystyrene foam

Expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) is usually white and made of expanded
polystyrene beads. Familiar uses include packing "peanuts" and molded packing
material for cushioning fragile items inside boxes. It is commonly packaged as
rigid panels (size 4 by 8 or 2 by 8 square feet in the United States), which
are also known as "bead-board". Thermal resistivity is usually about 28 mÂ·K/W
(or R-4 per inch in American customary units). Some EPS boards have a flame
spread of less than 25 and a smoke-developed index of less than 450, which
means they can be used without a fire barrier (but require a 15 minute thermal
barrier) according to US building codes. A growing use of EPS in construction
are Insulating concrete forms.

#### [edit] Extruded polystyrene foam

Extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) has air inclusions which gives it moderate
flexibility, a low density, and a low thermal conductivity. XPS is sometimes
abbreviated "EPS" - not to be confused with expanded polystyrene foam.

Extruded polystyrene material is also in crafts and model building,
particularly architectural models. Foamed between two sheets of paper, it
makes a more uniform substitute for corrugated cardboard. Thermal resistivity
is usually about 35 mÂ·Kelvin/W (or R-5 per inch in American customary units).

Trade names for XPS include "Styrofoam" and "Foamcore". ("Styrofoam" is often
also used as a generic name for all polystyrene foams.)

### [edit] Copolymers

Pure polystyrene is brittle, but hard enough that a fairly high-performance
product can be made by giving it some of the properties of a stretchier
material, such as polybutadiene rubber. The two such materials can never
normally be mixed because of the amplified effect of intermolecular forces on
polymer insolubility (see plastic recycling), but if polybutadiene is added
during polymerization it can become chemically bonded to the polystyrene,
forming a graft copolymer which helps to incorporate normal polybutadiene into
the final mix, resulting in high-impact polystyrene or HIPS, often called
"high-impact plastic" in advertisements. One commercial name for HIPS is
Bextrene. Common applications of HIPS include toys and product casings. HIPS
is usually injection molded in production. Autoclaving polystyrene can
compress and harden the material.

Several other copolymers are also used with styrene. Acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene or ABS plastic is similar to HIPS: a copolymer of acrylonitrile and
styrene, toughened with polybutadiene. Most electronics cases are made of this
form of polystyrene, as are many sewer pipes. ABS pipes may become brittle
over time. SAN is a copolymer of styrene with acrylonitrile, and SMA one with
maleic anhydride. Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers; for
example, divinylbenzene for cross-linking the polystyrene chains.

## [edit] Disposal and environmental issues

Polystyrene is not easily recycled because of its light weight (especially if
foamed) and its low scrap value. It is generally not accepted in kerbside
(curbside) collection recycling programs. In Germany, however, polystyrene is
collected, as a consequence of the packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that
requires manufacturers to take responsibility for recycling or disposing of
any packaging material they sell.

On the other hand, great advances have been made in recycling expanded
polystyrene at an industrial level. Many different methods of densification
have been developed. This increase in density, usually greater than 15#/cubic
foot makes clean polystyrene a good profit center in recycling
operations.[citation needed] Some industrial polystyrene manufacturers accept
post consumer EPS for recycling. As an example Dart Container Corporation in
Mason, Michigan has an ongoing post consumer recycling operation as well as an
industrial EPS scrap recycling operation.

### [edit] Environmental impact

Discarded polystyrene does not biodegrade and is resistant to photolysis[10].
Since the foamed kinds not only float on water, but also blow in the wind, it
is often abundant in the outdoor environment, particularly along shores and
waterways. According to the California Coastal Commission, it is now a
principal component of marine debris. The plastic may also be harmful to wild
animals if it is ingested by them.[citation needed]

Polystyrene foams are produced using blowing agents that form bubbles and
expand the foam. In expanded polystyrene, these are usually hydrocarbons such
as pentane, which may pose a flammability hazard in manufacturing or storage
of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact.
By January 1994 use of all chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for foodservice
polystyrene foam was prohibited per the Clean Air Act.[citation needed]
However, extruded polystyrene is usually made with HCFC blowing agents which
have effects on ozone depletion and on global warming. Their ozone depletion
potential is greatly reduced relative to CFCs which were formerly used, but
their global warming potential can be on the order of 1000 or more, meaning it
has 1000 times greater effect on global warming than does carbon dioxide. [11]

### [edit] Recycling

Currently, the majority of polystyrene products are not recycled because of a
lack of consumer awareness regarding suitable recycling facilities and
methods. Expanded polystyrene can be used to make park benches, flower pots,
and toys. However, polystyrene "recycling" is not a closed loop, producing
more polystyrene; polystyrene cups and other packaging materials are instead
usually used as fillers in other plastics, or in other items that cannot
themselves be recycled and are thrown away.[citation needed]

Manufacturers can make clothes hangers, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling
containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.[12]

Recycled EPS is used in many metal casting operations. It can be combined with
cement to be used as an insulating amendment in the making of concrete
foundations.[citation needed] American manufacturers have produced insulated
concrete forms made with approximately 80% recycled EPS since 1993.

### [edit] Incineration

If polystyrene is properly incinerated at high temperatures, the only
chemicals generated are water, carbon dioxide, some volatile compounds, and
carbon soot[13]. If properly burned, one ton of foam cups produces 0.2 ounces
of ash. Paper cups, when incinerated, produce an average of 200 pounds of ash
per ton. Recently, great advances have been made in using condensed EPS as
fuel in the Pacific Rim[citation needed].

When burned without enough oxygen or at lower temperatures (as in a campfire
or a household fireplace), polystyrene can produce polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, carbon black, and carbon monoxide, as well as styrene
monomers.[13][14]

### [edit] Burial

Foam cups and other polystyrene products can be safely buried in landfills,
since it is as stable as concrete or brick. No plastic film is required to
protect the air and underground water.

### [edit] Reducing

Restricting the use of foamed polystyrene takeout food packaging is a priority
of many solid waste environmental organizations. A campaign to achieve the
first ban of polystyrene foam from the food & beverage industry in Canada has
been launched in Toronto as of January 2007, by local non-profit organization
NaturoPack.[15]

## [edit] Finishing

In the United States, environmental protection regulations prohibit the use of
solvents on polystyrene (which would dissolve the polystyrene and de-foam most
foams anyway).

Some acceptable finishing materials are

  * Water-based paint (artists have created paintings on polystyrene with gouache)
  * Mortar or acrylic/cement render, often used in the building industry as a weather-hard overcoat that hides the foam completely after finishing the objects.
  * Cotton wool or other fabrics used in conjunction with a stapling implement.

## [edit] Health and fire hazards

There is concern about the trace presence of polystyrene's production
chemicals in the final plastic product, most of which are toxic if not
removed. For instance benzene, which is used to produce ethylbenzene for
styrene, is a known carcinogen. As well, unpolymerized styrene may pose health
risks. Nevertheless, the EPA states:

â Styrene is primarily used in the production of polystyrene plastics and
resins. Acute (short-term) exposure to styrene in humans results in mucous
membrane and eye irritation, and gastrointestinal effects. Chronic (long-term)
exposure to styrene in humans results in effects on the central nervous system
(CNS), such as headache, fatigue, weakness, and depression, CNS dysfunction,
hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy. Human studies are inconclusive on the
reproductive and developmental effects of styrene; several studies did not
report an increase in developmental effects in women who worked in the
plastics industry, while an increased frequency of spontaneous abortions and
decreased frequency of births were reported in another study. Several
epidemiologic studies suggest there may be an association between styrene
exposure and an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma. However, the evidence
is inconclusive due to confounding factors. EPA has not given a formal
carcinogen classification to styrene. [16] â  
Polystyrene is classified according to DIN4102 as a "B3" product, meaning
highly flammable or "easily ignited." Consequently, although it is an
efficient insulator at low temperatures, its use is prohibited in any exposed
installations in building construction if the material is not flame retardant,
e.g., with hexabromocyclododecane. It must be concealed behind drywall, sheet
metal or concrete. Foamed polystyrene plastic materials have been accidentally
ignited and caused huge fires and losses, for example at the DÃ¼sseldorf
International Airport, the Channel tunnel (where polystyrene was inside a
railcar that caught on fire), and the Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant (where
fire reached through a fire retardant and reached the foamed plastic
underneath, inside a firestop that had not been tested and certified in
accordance with the final installation).

In addition to fire hazard, polystyrene can be dissolved by substances that
contain acetone (such as most aerosol paint sprays), and by cyanoacrylate
glues.
