Polish (jÄzyk polski, polszczyzna), an official language of Poland, has the
largest number of speakers of any West Slavic language.[4] Polish-speakers use
the language in a uniform manner through most of Poland, and it has a Latin-
based orthography. The language developed indigenously and retains many
ancient Slavic features of pronunciation and grammar. Although non-Polish
administrations in Poland sometimes attempted, historically, to suppress the
Polish language, a rich literature has nonetheless developed over the
centuries, and many works by Polish authors are available in translations in
English and other languages.

## [edit] Geographic distribution

Nearly 97% of Poland's citizens declare Polish as their mother tongue. As a
result of World War II Poland was forced to change its borders, which resulted
in various migrations (World War II evacuation and expulsion, German
expulsions, Operation WisÅa) as well as in ethnic cleansing of the Poles
across the current borders such as the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia.
Nevertheless, after the Second World War the previously Polish territories
annexed by the Soviet Union retained a significant proportion of the Polish
population unwilling or unable to undergo forced migration toward the
post-1945 Poland. Even today ethnic Poles constitute large minorities in
Lithuania, Belarus, and among the Poles in Ukraine. Polish is by far the most
widely used minority language in Lithuania's Vilnius County (26% of the
population, according to the 2001 census results), and it is also present in
other counties. In Ukraine, Polish is most often used in the Lviv and Lutsk
regions. Western Belarus has an important Polish minority, especially in the
Brest and Grodno regions.

Significant numbers of Polish speakers also inhabit: Argentina, Andorra,
Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia,
Lebanon, Luxembourg, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South
Africa, Sweden, Peru, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Ukraine, UAE,
the UK, Uruguay and the United States.

In the United States, Polish Americans number more than 11 million, but most
of them cannot speak Polish fluently. According to the United States 2000
Census, 667,414 Americans of age 5 years and over reported Polish as the
language spoken at home: about 1.4% of people who speak languages other than
English, or 0.25% of the U.S. population. The largest concentrations of Polish
speakers reported in the census (over 50%) occur in three states: Illinois
(185,749), New York (111,740) and New Jersey (74,663).[5]

Canada has a significant Polish Canadian population. The 2006 census recorded
242,885 speakers of Polish, with a particular concentration in the city of
Toronto, Ontario (91,810 speakers).[6]

## [edit] Dialects

Main article: Dialects of the Polish language

The Polish language became far more homogeneous in the second half of the 20th
century, in part due to the mass-migration of several million Polish citizens
from the eastern to the western part of the country after the Soviet Union
annexed the eastern Polish lands in 1939.

The inhabitants of different regions of Poland still[update] speak "Standard"
Polish somewhat differently, although the differences between these broad
"dialects" appear slight. First-language speakers of Polish never experience
any difficulty in mutual understanding, and non-native speakers can generally
not easily distinguish regional variations. The differences are slight
compared to different dialects of English, for example.

The regional differences correspond mainly to old tribal divisions[citation
needed] from around a thousand years ago; the most significant of these in
terms of numbers of speakers relate to:

  * Great Polish (spoken in the west)
  * Lesser Polish (spoken in the south and southeast)
  * Mazovian (Mazur) spoken throughout the central and eastern parts of the country. Mazovian shares some features with the Kashubian language (see below).
  * Silesian, spoken in the southwest (controversy)

Some more characteristic but less widespread regional dialects include:

  1. The distinctive Podhale dialect (GÃ³ralski) occurs in the mountainous areas bordering the Czech and Slovak Republics. The GÃ³rale (highlanders) take great pride in their culture and the dialect. It exhibits some cultural influences from the Vlach shepherds[citation needed] who migrated from Wallachia (southern Romania) in the 14th-17th centuries[citation needed]. The language of the coextensive East Slavic ethnic group, the Lemkos, which demonstrates significant lexical and grammatical commonality with the GÃ³ralski dialect, bears no significant Vlach or other Romanian influences. Most urban Poles find it difficult to understand this very distinct dialect.[7]
  2. In the western and northern regions where Poles from the territories annexed by the Soviet Union resettled, the older generation speaks a dialect of Polish characteristic of the Eastern Borderlands which resembles Russian â especially in the "longer" pronunciation of vowels.
  3. The Kashubian language, spoken in the Pomorze region west of GdaÅsk on the Baltic Sea, a language closely related to Polish, has seemed like a dialect to some observers. However, it exhibits sufficient significant differences to merit its classification as a separate language; for instance, it is not readily understandable to Polish speakers unless written. There are about 53,000 speakers according to the 2002 census.
  4. The Silesian language, spoken in the Silesia region west of Katowice, a language related to Polish, has seemed like a dialect to some observers. However, it exhibits sufficient significant differences to merit its classification as a separate language; for instance, it is not readily understandable to Polish speakers. There are about 60,000 speakers according to the 2002 census.
  5. Poles living in Lithuania (particularly in the Vilnius region), in Belarus (particularly the northwest), and in the northeast of Poland continue to speak the Eastern Borderlands dialect which sounds "slushed", and is easily distinguishable.
  6. Some city dwellers, especially the less affluent population, had their own distinctive dialects â for example the Warsaw dialect, still spoken by some of the population of Praga on the eastern bank of the Vistula. (Praga remained the only part of Warsaw where the population survived World War II relatively intact.) However, these city dialects are now[update] mostly extinct due to assimilation with standard Polish.
  7. Many Poles living in emigrant communities (for example in the USA) whose families left Poland just after World War II, retain a number of minor features of Polish vocabulary as spoken in the first half of the 20th century, but which now sound archaic to contemporary visitors from Poland.

## [edit] Phonology

Main article: Polish phonology

Polish has a relatively simple vowel-system, with only six oral and two nasal
vowels. The Polish consonant system shows more complexity: its characteristic
features include the series of affricates and palatal consonants that resulted
from four Proto-Slavic palatalizations and two further palatalizations which
took place in Polish and Belarusian. The stress falls generally on the
penultimate (second to last) syllable.

## [edit] Orthography

Main article: Polish orthography

This article contains IPA phonetic symbols. Without proper rendering support,
you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Unicode
characters.  
The Polish alphabet derives from the Latin alphabet but uses diacritics, such
as kreska (graphically similar to the acute accent), kropka (superior dot) and
ogonek ("little tail"). Unlike other Latin-character Slavic languages (apart
from Kashubian), Polish did not adopt a version of the Czech orthography, but
developed one independently.

[tÍ¡ÊÌ ], [dÍ¡ÊÌ ] respectively. Also note that Polish Å (transcribed here
as [É²]) is not palatal, having the same place of articulation as [É] and
[Ê]. However, as the IPA does not have a symbol for a nasal alveolo-palatal
consonant, a more accurate representation would be [nÊ²] or the obselete [Èµ].

The letters Q (ku), V (fau) and X (iks) do not belong to the Polish alphabet,
but they occur in some commercial names and in some foreign words. Some
letters, such as those listed are used but not that often. In Polish
pronunciation there is no need for them. They are replaced with K, W and KS/GZ
respectively. Some letters, like Y and W are pronounced differently.

Polish orthography also includes seven digraphs:

Note that although the Polish orthography mostly follows phonetic-
morphological lines, some sounds may appear in more than one written form:

  * [x] as either h or ch
  * [Ê] as either Å¼ or rz (though rÅ¼ denotes a [r-Ê] cluster)
  * [u] as either u or Ã³
  * soft consonants are spelt either Ä, dÅº, Å, Å, Åº, or ci, dzi, ni, si, zi (Ä, Å etc. are spelt before a consonant or at the end of a word, whereas ci, ni etc. are used before vowels a, Ä , e, Ä, o, u; c, dz, n, s, z alone are used before i.)

The two consonants rz very occasionally reflect the sounds "r z", not [Ê], as
in words "zamarzaÄ" (to get frozen), "marznÄ Ä" (to feel cold) or in the
name "Tarzan".

The pronunciation of geminates (doubled consonants) in Polish always sounds
distinct from single consonants. Note that they should not be pronounced in a
prolonged manner, as in Finnish and Italian, but it happens often in informal
conversations. In correct pronunciation, speakers should articulate and
release each of the two consonants separately. The prolongation is therefore
rather a repetition of the consonant. For example, the word panna (young
lady/maiden) is not read the same way as pana (mr.'s/master's), but should be
pronounced pan-na, with two n. This includes not only native Polish words
(like panna or oddech), but also loan-words (lasso, attyka). In Polish,
geminates may appear in the beginning of a word, as in czczenie (worshipping),
dÅ¼dÅ¼ownica (earth-worm), ssak (mammal), wwÃ³z (importation), zstÄ piÄ (to
descend; to step down), and zza (from behind; from beyond) but never appear at
the end of a word of Slavic origin.

## [edit] Grammar

### [edit] Nouns and adjectives

<IMG>

Please help improve this article or section by expanding it. Further
information might be found on the talk page. (March 2009)  
[Case declension should be covered as well.]

A highly inflected language, Polish retains the Old Slavic case-system with
seven cases for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives:

  1. nominative (mianownik)
  2. genitive (dopeÅniacz)
  3. dative (celownik)
  4. accusative (biernik)
  5. instrumental (narzÄdnik)
  6. locative (miejscownik)
  7. vocative (woÅacz)

Modern Polish has only two number classes: singular and plural. In the past
there was also a dual number, which applied only to pairs. This form, however,
vanished around the 15th century and now is present only in few traces. For
instance, the proverb "MÄ drej gÅowie doÅÄ dwie sÅowie" (Two words are
enough for a clever head) may seem to be not grammatically correct ("MÄ drej
gÅowie doÅÄ dwa sÅowa"), but it is a relict of dual number.

Like many other Slavic languages, including Russian, Polish uses no definite
or indefinite articles.

The Polish gender system, like that of Russian and of almost all the other
Balto-Slavic languages, appears complex, due to its combination of three
categories: gender (masculine, feminine, neuter), personhood (personal versus
non-personal) and animacy (animate versus inanimate). Personhood and animacy
are relevant within the masculine gender but do not affect the feminine or
neuter genders. The resulting system can be presented as comprising five
gender classes: personal masculine, animate (non-personal) masculine,
inanimate masculine, feminine, and neuter. These classes can be identified
based on declension patterns, adjective-noun agreement, and pronoun-antecedent
agreement.

Gender Nominative singular Accusative singular Nominative plural Meaning  
Adjective Noun Adjective Noun Adjective Noun  
Personal masculine nowy student nowego studenta nowi studenci "new student(s)"  
Animate masculine nowy pies nowego psa nowe psy "new dog(s)"  
Inanimate masculine nowy stÃ³Å nowy stÃ³Å nowe stoÅy "new table(s)"  
Feminine nowa szafa nowÄ  szafÄ nowe szafy "new wardrobe(s)"  
Neuter nowe krzesÅo nowe krzesÅo nowe krzesÅa "new chair(s)"  
The gender classes display the following inflectional properties (with rare
exceptions):

  1. Personal masculine: accusative = genitive (both singular and plural), distinctive softening ending in the nominative plural
  2. Animate (non-personal) masculine: nominative singular ending in a consonant (nouns), accusative singular = genitive singular, accusative plural = nominative plural
  3. Inanimate masculine: nominative singular ending in a consonant (nouns), accusative = nominative (singular and plural)
  4. Neuter: nominative singular in "-o" or "-e", genitive singular in "-a" (nouns), accusative = nominative (singular and plural)
  5. Feminine: dative singular = locative singular, accusative plural = nominative plural.

The gender classification of masculine nouns does not always match up with
their semantic reference (human, animate, or inanimate). In particular, the
class of grammatically animate nouns includes a significant number of nouns
referring to inanimate entities (e.g. zÅoty "zloty", cukierek "candy",
papieros "cigarette") as well as nouns used figuratively to refer to people
(geniusz "genius", oryginaÅ "original"). In the plural, personal masculine
forms are used for referring to groups of males, or mixed groups of males and
females.

To determine correct adjective-noun agreement, only four genders need to be
distinguished in the singular (classes 1 and 2 can be combined), and only two
genders are needed in the plural (class 1 contrasting with 2-3-4-5 combined).
For correct pronoun selection, the gender system can be further simplified to
three classes in the singular, and two in the plural. The following table
shows which 3rd person nominative pronoun corresponds to nouns of each gender
class:

Gender of antecedent Singular Plural  
Personal masculine on oni  
Animate masculine one  
Inanimate masculine  
Feminine ona  
Neuter ono  
### [edit] Verbs

Polish inflects verbs according to gender as well as person and number, but
the tense forms have been simplified through elimination of three old tenses
(the aorist, imperfect, and past perfect). The so-called Slavic perfect is the
only past tense form used in common speech. In Polish, one distinguishes
between

  * three tenses (present, past and future)
  * three moods (indicative, imperative and conditional)
  * three voices (active, passive and reflexive).

Aspect, a grammatical category of the verb, affects almost all Polish verbs in
their two aspects, in each tense:

  1. imperfective (often translated as a progressive tense in English with -ing, for example 'was going', 'is going', "will be going")
  2. perfective (often translated as a simple tense in English, for example 'went', 'go' 'will go').

The tenses include:

construction (for perfective verbs) (for imperfective verbs) example
imperfective example perfective  
verb+Ä infinitive infinitive robiÄ zrobiÄ  
verb+suffix future simple tense present tense robicie zrobicie  
past participle+suffix past perfective tense past imperfective tense
robiliÅcie zrobiliÅcie  
(this suffix can be moved) coÅcie robili / co robiliÅcie coÅcie zrobili /
co zrobiliÅcie  
Movable suffixes (those of the past tenses) usually attach to the verb or to
the most accented word of a sentence, like question preposition.

The fifth Polish tense, the future imperfective, expressed in analytic form,
consists of the simple future form of the auxiliary verb byÄ âto beâ
(bÄdÄ, bÄdziesz...), and either infinitive or past participle
(imperfective). The choice between bÄdziecie robiÄ and bÄdziecie robili is
free, and both forms have the same meaning.

Sometimes the sentence may be emphasised with a particle -Å¼e- (-Å¼).

So what have you done? can be:

  * Co zrobiliÅcie?
  * CoÅcie zrobili?
  * Co Å¼eÅcie zrobili? (although this form is considered regional and/or incorrect by some)

(It is also well worth noticing that the two latter forms - "coÅcie zrobili?"
and "co Å¼eÅcie zrobili?" often carry a negative emotional load, a possible
translation of these examples being "what (the hell) have you done!?" The
third form, using "Å¼eÅcie", would be even stronger - fitting for situations
involving desperation, etc. (and indeed being a little archaic or regional))

All the above examples show inflected forms of the verb "zrobiÄ" for the
subject "you" informal plural ("wy"). However, it is worthy of notice that
none of the above examples includes the subject itself. The inclusion of the
subject is not necessary here because Polish is a pro-drop language. This
means that with an inflected verb the subject does not need to be mentioned.
Instead, the reader or listener can tell, by the ending on the verb, which is
different for each person, singular and plural, what is the implied subject.
Because the subject can be dropped, using it with an inflected verb signals
emphasis. Of the above three examples, a native speaker would not include the
subject in the middle sentence and would be unlikely to include the subject in
the last one.

The past participle depends on number and gender, so the third person, past
perfect tense, can be:

  * \- singular
  * zrobiÅ (he made/did)
  * zrobiÅa (she made/did)
  * zrobiÅo (it made/did)
  * \- plural
  * zrobili (they made/did {men, people of both sexes})
  * zrobiÅy (they made/did {women, children})

### [edit] Word order

Basic word order in Polish is SVO, however, as it is a synthetic language, it
is possible to move words around in the sentence, and to drop the subject,
object or even sometimes verb, if they are obvious from context.

These sentences mean more or less the same ("Alice has a cat"), but different
shades of meaning are emphasized by selecting different word orders.

  * Alicja ma kota - standard order
  * Alicja kota ma - emphasis on "ma" = "has" - it could be said in response to a statement saying that the relation is opposite, like "- Alicja nie ma kota. - Ale ona kota ma!" ("- Alice doesn't have a cat. - But she has!")
  * Kota ma Alicja - emphasis on "Alicja" - "It is Alice, who has the cat."
  * Ma Alicja kota - rarely useful and often awkward, but still correct. Precise meaning is context- and pronounciation dependant.
  * Kota Alicja ma - similar to the word order above
  * Ma kota Alicja - similar to the word order above

Note that each word order could carry a slightly different meaning, which
might be really hard to get ahold of for a non-native speaker. There are no
rules governing this, and even the emphases listed above could be easily
changed with proper pronounciation.

Sometimes if apparent from context, the subject, object or even the verb, can
be dropped:

  * Ma kota - can be used if it is obvious who is the person talked about
  * Ma - short answer for "Czy Alicja ma kota?" (as in "Yes, she does")
  * Alicja - answer for "Kto ma kota?" (as in "Alice does")
  * Kota - answer for "Co ma Alicja?" (as in "The cat")
  * Alicja ma - (as in "Alice does [have one]") answer for "Kto z naszych znajomych ma kota?" ("Who among our acquaintances has a cat?")

Note the interrogative particle "czy", which is used to start a yes/no
question, much like the French "est-ce que". (See also tag question.) The
particle is not obligatory, and sometimes rising intonation is the only signal
of the interrogative character of the sentence: "Alicja ma kota?".

There is a tendency in Polish to drop the subject rather than the object as it
is uncommon to know the object but not the subject. If the question were "Kto
ma kota?" (Who has a/the cat?), the answer should be "Alicja" alone, without a
verb.

In particular, "ja" (I) and "ty" (you, singular), and their plural equivalents
"my" (we) and "wy" (you, plural), are almost always dropped, much like the
respective Spanish pronouns.

  * Oni szli - (masculine, masculine + feminine, masculine + neutral)- They were going
  * One szÅy - (feminine + feminine) - They were going
  * PaÅstwo szli - (masculine, masculine + feminine, masculine + neutral)- You were going (polite)
  * Panie szÅy - (feminine + feminine) - You were going (polite)

In Polish, the use of personal pronouns to mark the subject is not necessary
because flexed word contains such information. Therefore, one may omit the
personal pronouns as follows, while retaining the same meaning:

  * IdÄ (= I am going)
  * Idziesz (= You are going)
  * Idzie (= She/He/It is going)
  * Idziemy (= We are going)
  * Idziecie (= You are going)
  * IdÄ (= They are going)

## [edit] Borrowed words

Polish has, over the centuries, borrowed a number of words from other
languages. Usually, borrowed words have been adapted rapidly in the following
ways:

  1. Spelling was altered to approximate the pronunciation, but written according to Polish phonetics.
  2. Word endings are liberally applied to almost any word to produce verbs, nouns, adjectives, as well as adding the appropriate endings for cases of nouns, diminutives, augmentatives, etc.

Depending on the historical period, borrowing has proceeded from various
languages. Recent borrowing is primarily of "international" words from the
English language, mainly those that have Latin or Greek roots, for example
komputer (computer), korupcja (corruption) etc. Slang sometimes borrows and
alters common English words, e.g. luknÄ Ä (to look). Concatenation of parts
of words (e.g. auto-moto), which is not native to Polish but common in e.g.
English, is also sometimes used. When borrowing international words, Polish
often changes their spelling. For example, Latin suffix '-tio' corresponds to
-cja. To make the word plural, -cja becomes -cje. Examples of this include
inauguracja (inauguration), dewastacja (devastation), konurbacja (conurbation)
and konotacje (connotations). Also, the digraph qu becomes kw (kwadrant =
quadrant; kworum = quorum).

Other notable influences in the past have been Latin (9th-18th century), Czech
(10th and 14th-15th century), Italian (15th-16th century), French (18th-19th
century), German (13-15th and 18th-20th century, Hungarian (14th-16th
century), Turkish (17th century), Old Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian.

The Latin language, for a very long time the only official language of the
Polish state, has had a great influence on Polish. Many Polish words
(rzeczpospolita from res publica, zdanie for both "opinion" and "sentence",
from sententia) were direct calques from Latin.

Many words have been borrowed from the German language, as a result of being
neighbours for a millennium, and also due to a sizable German population in
Polish cities since medieval times.

The regional dialects of Upper Silesia and Masuria (Modern Polish East
Prussia) have noticeably more German loanwords than other dialects. Latin was
known to a larger or smaller degree by most of the numerous szlachta in the
16th to 18th centuries (and it continued to be extensively taught at secondary
schools until World War II). Apart from dozens of loanwords, its influence can
also be seen in somewhat greater number of verbatim Latin phrases in Polish
literature (especially from the 19th century and earlier), than, say, in
English.

In the 18th century, with rising prominence of France in Europe, French
supplanted Latin in this respect. Some French borrowings also date from the
Napoleonic era, when the Poles were enthusiastic supporters of Napoleon.
Examples include ekran (from French Ã©cran, screen), abaÅ¼ur (abat-jour, lamp
shade), rekin (requin, shark), meble (meuble, furniture), bagaÅ¼ (bagage,
luggage), walizka (valise, suitcase), fotel (fauteuil, armchair), plaÅ¼a
(plage, beach) and koszmar (cauchemar, nightmare). Some place names have also
been adapted from French, such as the two Warsaw boroughs of Å»oliborz (joli
bord=beautiful riverside) and MokotÃ³w (mon coteau=my hill), as well as the
town of Å»yrardÃ³w (from the name Girard, with the Polish suffix -Ã³w attached
to point at owner/founder of a town).

Other words are borrowed from other Slavic languages, for example, sejm,
haÅba and brama from Czech.

Some words like bachor (an unruly boy or child) and ciuchy (slang for
clothing) were borrowed from Yiddish, spoken by the large Polish Jewish
population before their numbers were severely depleted during the Holocaust.

Typical loanwords from Italian include pomidor from pomodoro (tomato),
kalafior from cavolfiore (cauliflower), pomaraÅcza from l'arancio (orange),
etc. Those were introduced in the times of queen Bona Sforza (the wife of
Polish king Sigismund the Old) who was famous for introducing Poland to
Italian cuisine, especially vegetables. Another interesting word of Italian
origin is autostrada (from Italian "autostrada", highway).

The contacts with Ottoman Turkey in the 17th century brought many new words,
some of them still in use, such as: jar (deep valley), szaszÅyk (shish
kebab), filiÅ¼anka (cup), arbuz (water melon), dywan (carpet), kieÅbasa
(sausage) [8] , etc.

The mountain dialects of the GÃ³rale in southern Poland, have quite a number
of words borrowed from Hungarian (e.g. baca, gazda, juhas, hejnaÅ) and
Romanian from historical contacts with Hungarian-dominated Slovakia and
Wallachian herders who travelled north along the Carpathians.

Thieves' slang includes such words as kimaÄ (to sleep) or majcher (knife) of
Greek origin, considered then unknown to the outside world.

Direct borrowings from Russian are extremely rare, in spite of long periods of
dependence on tzarist Russia and the Soviet Union, and are limited to few
internationalisms as sputnik or pieriestrojka[citation needed].

There are also few words borrowed form Mongolian language, those are dzida
(spear) or szereg (a line, column). Those words were brought to Polish
language during wars with Genghis Khan's armies.

## [edit] Borrowings from Polish

The Polish language has influenced others. Particular influences show in
German and in other Slavic languages â due to their proximity and shared
borders. Examples of loanwords include German Grenze (border) from Polish
granica, Peitzker from piskorz (weatherfish). Quite a few culinary loanwords
exist in German and in other languages, some of which describe distinctive
features of Polish cuisine. These include German Quark from twarÃ³g (cottage
cheese) and Gurke from ogÃ³rek (cucumber). The word pierogi (a plural noun in
Polish) has spread internationally, as have pÄ czki and ogonek ("little tail")
â the word describing a diacritic hook-sign added below some letters in
various alphabets.
