A page from the Hindu calendar 1871â1872.

A calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial,
or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of time,
typically days, weeks, months, and years. The name given to each day is known
as a date. Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually,
though not necessarily, synchronized with the cycles of some astronomical
phenomenon, such as the cycle of the sun or the moon. Many civilizations and
societies have devised a calendar, usually derived from other calendars on
which they model their systems, suited to their particular needs.

A calendar is also a physical device (often paper). This is the most common
usage of the word. Other similar types of calendars can include computerized
systems, which can be set to remind the user of upcoming events and
appointments.

As a subset, calendar is also used to denote a list of particular set of
planned events (for example, court calendar).

The English word calendar is derived from the Latin word kalendae, which was
the Latin name of the first day of every month.[1]

## [edit] Calendar systems

A full calendar system has a different calendar date for every day. Thus the
week cycle is by itself not a full calendar system; neither is a system to
name the days within a year without a system for identifying the years.

The simplest calendar system just counts time periods from a reference date.
This applies for the Julian day. Virtually the only possible variation is
using a different reference date, in particular one less distant in the past
to make the numbers smaller. Computations in these systems are just a matter
of addition and subtraction.

Other calendars have one (or multiple) larger units of time.

Calendars that contain one level of cycles:

  * week and weekday â this system (without year, the week number keeps on increasing) is not very common
  * year and ordinal date within the year, e.g. the ISO 8601 ordinal date system

Calendars with two levels of cycles:

  * year, month, and day â most systems, including the Gregorian calendar (and its very similar predecessor, the Julian calendar), the Islamic calendar, and the Hebrew calendar
  * year, week, and weekday â e.g. the ISO week date

Cycles can be synchronized with periodic phenomena:

  * A lunar calendar is synchronized to the motion of the Moon (lunar phases); an example is the Islamic calendar.
  * A solar calendar is based on perceived seasonal changes synchronized to the apparent motion of the Sun; an example is the Persian calendar.
  * A "luni-solar calendar" is based on a combination of both solar and lunar reckonings; an example is the traditional calendar of China.
  * There are some calendars that appear to be synchronized to the motion of Venus, such as some of the ancient Egyptian calendars; synchronization to Venus appears to occur primarily in civilizations near the Equator.
  * The week cycle is an example of one that is not synchronized to any external phenomenon (although it may have been derived from lunar phases, beginning anew every month).

Very commonly a calendar includes more than one type of cycle, or has both
cyclic and acyclic elements. A lunisolar calendar is synchronized both to the
motion of the moon and to the apparent motion of the sun; an example is the
Hebrew calendar.

Many calendars incorporate simpler calendars as elements. For example, the
rules of the Hebrew calendar depend on the seven-day week cycle (a very simple
calendar), so the week is one of the cycles of the Hebrew calendar. It is also
common to operate two calendars simultaneously, usually providing unrelated
cycles, and the result may also be considered a more complex calendar. For
example, the Gregorian calendar has no inherent dependence on the seven-day
week, but in Western society the two are used together, and calendar tools
indicate both the Gregorian date and the day of week.[2]

The week cycle is shared by various calendar systems (although the
significance of special days such as Friday, Saturday, and Sunday varies).
Systems of leap days usually do not affect the week cycle. The week cycle was
not even interrupted when 10, 11, 12, or 13 dates were skipped when the Julian
calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar by various countries.

### [edit] Solar calendars

Main article: Solar calendar

#### [edit] Days used by solar calendars

Solar calendars assign a date to each solar day. A day may consist of the
period between sunrise and sunset, with a following period of night, or it may
be a period between successive events such as two sunsets. The length of the
interval between two such successive events may be allowed to vary slightly
during the year, or it may be averaged into a mean solar day. Other types of
calendar may also use a solar day.

#### [edit] Calendar reform

Main article: Calendar reform

There have been a number of proposals for reform of the calendar, such as the
World Calendar, International Fixed Calendar and Holocene calendar. The United
Nations considered adopting such a reformed calendar for a while in the 1950s,
but these proposals have lost most of their popularity.

### [edit] Lunar calendars

Main article: Lunar calendar

Not all calendars use the solar year as a unit. A lunar calendar is one in
which days are numbered within each lunar phase cycle. Because the length of
the lunar month is not an even fraction of the length of the tropical year, a
purely lunar calendar quickly drifts against the seasons, which don't vary
much near the equator. It does, however, stay constant with respect to other
phenomena, notably tides. An example is the Islamic calendar.

A lunisolar calendar is a lunar calendar that compensates by adding an extra
month as needed to realign the months with the seasons. An example is the
Hebrew calendar which uses a 19-year cycle.

Lunar calendars are believed to be the oldest calendars invented by mankind.
Cro-Magnon people are claimed to have invented one around 32,000 BC.

## [edit] Calendar subdivisions

Nearly all calendar systems group consecutive days into "months" and also into
"years". In a solar calendar a year approximates Earth's tropical year (that
is, the time it takes for a complete cycle of seasons), traditionally used to
facilitate the planning of agricultural activities. In a lunar calendar, the
month approximates the cycle of the moon phase. Consecutive days may be
grouped into other periods such as the week.

Because the number of days in the tropical year is not a whole number, a solar
calendar must have a different number of days in different years. This may be
handled, for example, by adding an extra day (29 February) in leap years. The
same applies to months in a lunar calendar and also the number of months in a
year in a lunisolar calendar. This is generally known as intercalation. Even
if a calendar is solar, but not lunar, the year cannot be divided entirely
into months that never vary in length.

Cultures may define other units of time, such as the week, for the purpose of
scheduling regular activities that do not easily coincide with months or
years. Many cultures use different baselines for their calendars' starting
years. For example, the year in Japan is based on the reign of the current
emperor: 2006 was Year 18 of the Emperor Akihito.

## [edit] Other calendar types

### [edit] Arithmetic and astronomical calendars

An astronomical calendar is based on ongoing observation; examples are the
religious Islamic calendar and the old religious Jewish calendar in the time
of the Second Temple. Such a calendar is also referred to as an observation-
based calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is that it is perfectly and
perpetually accurate. The disadvantage is that working out when a particular
date would occur is difficult.

An arithmetic calendar is one that is based on a strict set of rules; an
example is the current Jewish calendar. Such a calendar is also referred to as
a rule-based calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is the ease of
calculating when a particular date occurs. The disadvantage is imperfect
accuracy. Furthermore, even if the calendar is very accurate, its accuracy
diminishes slowly over time, owing to changes in Earth's rotation. This limits
the lifetime of an accurate arithmetic calendar to a few thousand years. After
then, the rules would need to be modified from observations made since the
invention of the calendar.

### [edit] Complete and incomplete calendars

Calendars may be either complete or incomplete. Complete calendars provide a
way of naming each consecutive day, while incomplete calendars do not. The
early Roman calendar, which had no way of designating the days of the winter
months other than to lump them together as "winter", is an example of an
incomplete calendar, while the Gregorian calendar is an example of a complete
calendar.

## [edit] Uses

The primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed
about and/or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has
happened. Days may be significant for civil, religious or social reasons. For
example, a calendar provides a way to determine which days are religious or
civil holidays, which days mark the beginning and end of business accounting
periods, and which days have legal significance, such as the day taxes are due
or a contract expires. Also a calendar may, by identifying a day, provide
other useful information about the day such as its season.

Calendars are also used to help people manage their personal schedules, time
and activities, particularly when individuals have numerous work, school, and
family commitments. People frequently use multiple systems, and may keep both
a business and family calendar to help prevent them from overcommitting their
time.

Calendars are also used as part of a complete timekeeping system: date and
time of day together specify a moment in time. In the modern world, written
calendars are no longer an essential part of such systems, as the advent of
accurate clocks has made it possible to record time independently of
astronomical events.

## [edit] Currently used calendars

Calendars in widespread use today include the Gregorian calendar, which is the
de facto international standard, and is used almost everywhere in the world
for civil purposes, including in the People's Republic of China and India
(along with the Indian national calendar). Due to the Gregorian calendar's
obvious connotations of Western Christianity, non-Christians and even some
Christians sometimes justify its use by replacing the traditional era
notations "AD" and "BC" ("Anno Domini" and "Before Christ") with "CE" and
"BCE" ("Common Era" and "Before Common Era"). The Hindu calendars are some of
the most ancient calendars of the world. Eastern Christians of eastern Europe
and western Asia used for a long time the Julian Calendar, that of the old
Orthodox church, in countries like Russia. For over 1500 years, Westerners
used the Julian Calendar also.

While the Gregorian calendar is widely used in Israel's business and day-to-
day affairs, the Hebrew calendar, used by Jews worldwide for religious and
cultural affairs, also influences civil matters in Israel (such as national
holidays) and can be used there for business dealings (such as for the dating
of checks).

The Iranian (Persian) calendar is used in Iran and Afghanistan. The Islamic
calendar is used by most non-Iranian Muslims worldwide. The Chinese, Hebrew,
Hindu, and Julian calendars are widely used for religious and/or social
purposes. The Ethiopian calendar or Ethiopic calendar is the principal
calendar used in Ethiopia and Eritrea. In Thailand, where the Thai solar
calendar is used, the months and days have adopted the western standard,
although the years are still based on the traditional Buddhist calendar.

Even where there is a commonly used calendar such as the Gregorian calendar,
alternate calendars may also be used, such as a fiscal calendar or the
astronomical year numbering system[3].

### [edit] Fiscal calendars

Main article: Fiscal calendar

A fiscal calendar (such as a 4/4/5 calendar) fixes each month at a specific
number of weeks to facilitate comparisons from month to month and year to
year. January always has exactly 4 weeks (Sunday through Saturday), February
has 4 weeks, March has 5 weeks, etc. Note that this calendar will normally
need to add a 53rd week to every 5th or 6th year, which might be added to
December or might not be, depending on how the organization uses those dates.
There exists an international standard way to do this (the ISO week). The ISO
week starts on a Monday, and ends on a Sunday. Week 1 is always the week that
contains 4 January in the Gregorian calendar.

## [edit] Gregorian calendar with Easter Sunday

Calculating the calendar of a previous year (for the Gregorian calendar taking
account of the week) is a relatively easy matter when Easter Sunday is not
included on the calendar. However, calculating for Easter Sunday is difficult
because the calculation requires the knowledge of the full moon cycle. Easter
Sunday is on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the Vernal
Equinox according to the computus. So, this makes an additional calculation
necessary on top of the normal calculation for January 1st and the calculation
of whether or not the year is a leap year.

There are only 14 different calendars when Easter Sunday is not involved. Each
calendar is determined by the day of the week January 1st falls on and whether
or not the year is a leap year. However, when Easter Sunday is included, there
are 70 different calendars (two for each date of Easter).

## [edit] Physical calendars

<IMG>

<IMG>

At-A-Glance 2004-2005 calendar

A calendar is also a physical device (often paper) (for example, a desktop
calendar or a wall calendar). In a paper calendar one or two sheets can show a
single day, a week, a month, or a year. If a sheet is for a single day, it
easily shows the date and the weekday. If a sheet is for multiple days it
shows a conversion table to convert from weekday to date and back. With a
special pointing device, or by crossing out past days, it may indicate the
current date and weekday. This is the most common usage of the word.

The sale of physical calendars has been restricted in some countries, and
given as a monopoly to universities and national academies. Examples include
the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the University of Helsinki, which had a
monopoly on the sale of calendars in Finland until the 1990s.

## [edit] Legal

Main article: Docket (court)

For lawyers and judges, the calendar is the docket used by the court to
schedule the order of hearings or trials. This is especially used in a
criminal calendar. A paralegal or court officer may actually keep track of the
cases on the calendar or docket, by use of docketing software or law practice
management software.
