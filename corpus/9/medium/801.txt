In computer science, the term integer is used to refer to a data type which
represents some finite subset of the mathematical integers. These are also
known as integral data types.

## [edit] Value and representation

The value of a datum with an integral type is the mathematical integer that it
corresponds to. The representation of this datum is the way the value is
stored in the computerâs memory. Integral types may be unsigned (capable of
representing only non-negative integers) or signed (capable of representing
negative integers as well).

The most common representation of a positive integer is a string of bits,
using the binary numeral system. The order of the bits varies; see endianness.
The width or precision of an integral type is the number of bits in its
representation. An integral type with n bits can encode 2n numbers; for
example an unsigned type typically represents the non-negative values 0
through 2nâ1.

There are three different ways to represent negative numbers in a binary
numeral system. The most common is twoâs complement, which allows a signed
integral type with n bits to represent numbers from â2(nâ1) through
2(nâ1)â1. Twoâs complement arithmetic is convenient because there is a
perfect one-to-one correspondence between representations and values, and
because addition, subtraction and multiplication do not need to distinguish
between signed and unsigned types. The other possibilities are sign-magnitude
and ones' complement. See Signed number representations for details.

Another, rather different, representation for integers is binary-coded
decimal, which is still commonly used in mainframe financial applications and
in databases.

Different CPUs support different integral data types. Typically, hardware will
support both signed and unsigned types but only a small, fixed set of widths.

The table above lists integral type widths that are supported in hardware by
common processors. High level programming languages provide more
possibilities. It is common to have a âdouble widthâ integral type that
has twice as many bits as the biggest hardware-supported type. Many languages
also have bit-field types (a specified number of bits, usually constrained to
be less than the maximum hardware-supported width) and range types (which can
represent only the integers in a specified range).

Some languages, such as Lisp, REXX and Haskell, support arbitrary precision
integers (also known as infinite precision integers or bignums). Other
languages which do not support this concept as a top-level construct may have
libraries available to represent very large numbers using arrays of smaller
variables, such as Java's `BigInteger` class or Perl's "`bigint`" package.
These use as much of the computerâs memory as is necessary to store the
numbers; however, a computer has only a finite amount of storage, so they too
can only represent a finite subset of the mathematical integers. These schemes
support very large numbers, for example one kilobyte of memory could be used
to store numbers up to 2466 digits long.

A Boolean or Flag type is a type which can represent only two values: 0 and 1,
usually identified with false and true respectively. This type can be stored
in memory using a single bit, but is often given a full byte for convenience
of addressing and speed of access.

A four-bit quantity is known as a nibble (when eating, being smaller than a
bite) or nybble (being a pun on the form of the word byte). One nibble
corresponds to one digit in hexadecimal and holds one digit or a sign code in
binary-coded decimal.

## [edit] Bytes and octets

Main article: Byte

The term byte initially meant âthe smallest addressable unit of memoryâ.
In the past, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-bit bytes have all been used. There have
also been computers that could address individual bits (âbit-addressed
machineâ), or that could only address 16- or 32-bit quantities (âword-
addressed machineâ). The term byte was usually not used at all in connection
with bit- and word-addressed machines.

The term octet always refers to an 8-bit quantity. It is mostly used in the
field of computer networking, where computers with different byte widths might
have to communicate.

In modern usage byte almost invariably means eight bits, since all other sizes
have fallen into disuse; thus byte has come to be synonymous with octet.

## [edit] Words

Main article: Word (computing)

The term word is used for a small group of bits which are handled
simultaneously by processors of a particular architecture. The size of a word
is thus CPU-specific. Many different word sizes have been used, including 6-,
8-, 12-, 16-, 18-, 24-, 32-, 36-, 39-, 48-, 60-, and 64-bit. Since it is
architectural, the size of a word is usually set by the first CPU in a family,
rather than the characteristics of a later compatible CPU. The meanings of
terms derived from word, such as longword, doubleword, quadword, and halfword,
also vary with the CPU and OS.

As of 2008 practically all new desktop processors are of the x86-64 family and
capable of using 64-bit words, they are however often used in 32-bit mode.
Embedded processors with 8- and 16-bit word size are still common. The 36-bit
word length was common in the early days of computers.

One important cause of non-portability of software is the incorrect assumption
that all computers have the same word size as the computer used by the
programmer. For example, if a programmer using the C language incorrectly
declares as `int` a variable that will be used to store values greater than
216 â 1, the program will fail on computers with 16-bit integers. That
variable should have been declared as `long`, which has at least 32 bits on
any computer. Programmers may also incorrectly assume that a pointer can be
converted to an integer without loss of information, which may work on (some)
32-bit computers, but fail on 64-bit computers with 64-bit pointers and 32-bit
integers.
