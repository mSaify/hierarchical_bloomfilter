MeSH Vagus+Nerve  
The vagus nerve (pronounced /ËveÉªËgÉs/) (VÄ-gÉs) (also called
pneumogastric nerve or cranial nerve X) is the tenth of twelve paired cranial
nerves, and is the only nerve that starts in the brainstem (within the medulla
oblongata) and extends, through the jugular foramen, down below the head, to
the neck, chest and abdomen, where it contributes to the innervation of the
viscera. Besides output to the various organs in the body the vagus nerve
conveys sensory information about the state of the body's organs to the
central nervous system. 80-90% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are
afferent (sensory) nerves communicating the state of the viscera to the
brain.[1]

The medieval Latin word vagus means literally "Wandering" (the words vagrant,
vagabond, and vague come from the same root). Sometimes the branches are
spoken of in the plural and are thus called vagi (/ËveÉªËgÐ°Éª/) (VÄ-gÄ«).
The vagus is also called the pneumogastric nerve since it innervates both the
lungs and the stomach.

## [edit] Branches

  * Auricular nerve
  * Pharyngeal nerve
  * Superior laryngeal nerve
  * Superior cervical cardiac branches of vagus nerve
  * Inferior cervical cardiac branch
  * Recurrent laryngeal nerve
  * Thoracic cardiac branches
  * Branches to the pulmonary plexus
  * Branches to the esophageal plexus
  * Anterior vagal trunk
  * Posterior vagal trunk

## [edit] Innervation

Both right and left vagus nerves descend from the brain in the carotid sheath,
lateral to the carotid artery.

The right vagus nerve gives rise to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve which
hooks around the right subclavian artery and ascends into the neck between the
trachea and esophagus. The right vagus then crosses anteriorly to the right
subclavian artery and runs posterior to the superior vena cava and descends
posterior to the right main bronchus and contributes to cardiac, pulmonary and
esophageal plexuses. It forms the posterior vagal trunk at lower part of the
esophagus and enters the diaphragm through the esophageal hiatus.

The left vagus nerve enters the thorax between left common carotid artery and
left subclavian artery and descends on the aortic arch. It gives rise to the
left recurrent laryngeal nerve which hooks around the aortic arch to the left
of the ligamentum arteriosum and ascends between the trachea and esophagus.
The left vagus further gives off thoracic cardiac branches, breaks up into
pulmonary plexus, continues into the esophageal plexus and enters the abdomen
as the anterior vagal trunk in the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm.

The vagus nerve supplies motor parasympathetic fibers to all the organs except
the suprarenal (adrenal) glands, from the neck down to the second segment of
the transverse colon. The vagus also controls a few skeletal muscles, namely:

  * Cricothyroid muscle
  * Levator veli palatini muscle
  * Salpingopharyngeus muscle
  * Palatoglossus muscle
  * Palatopharyngeus muscle
  * Superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors
  * Muscles of the larynx (speech).

This means that the vagus nerve is responsible for such varied tasks as heart
rate, gastrointestinal peristalsis, sweating, and quite a few muscle movements
in the mouth, including speech (via the recurrent laryngeal nerve) and keeping
the larynx open for breathing. It also receives some sensation from the outer
ear, via the Auricular branch (also known as Alderman's nerve) and part of the
meninges.

## [edit] The vagus nerve and the heart

Parasympathetic innervation of the heart is mediated by the vagus nerve. The
right vagus innervates the sinoatrial node. Parasympathetic hyperstimulation
predisposes those affected to bradyarrhythmias. The left vagus when
hyperstimulated predisposes the heart to atrioventricular (AV) blocks.

At this location Otto Loewi first proved that nerves secrete substances called
neurotransmitters which have effects on receptors in target tissues. Loewi
described the substance released by the vagus nerve as vagusstoff, which was
later found to be acetylcholine.

The vagus nerve has three nuclei in the CNS associated with cardiovascular
control, the dorsal motor nucleus, the nucleus ambiguus and the solitary
nucleus. The parasympathetic output to the heart comes mainly from neurons in
the nucleus ambiguus and to a lesser extent from the dorsal motor nucleus[2].
The solitary nucleus receives sensory input about the state of the
cardiovascular system, being an integrational hub for the baroreflex.

Drugs that inhibit the muscarinic cholinergic receptor (anticholinergics) such
as atropine and scopolamine are called vagolytic because they inhibit the
action of the vagus nerve on the heart, gastrointestinal tract and other
organs. Anticholinergic drugs increase heart rate and are used to treat
bradycardia (slow heart rate) and asystole, which is when the heart has no
electrical activity. Anticholinergic drugs relax the detrusor muscle and cause
constipation which again involves the vagus nerve.

## [edit] Medical treatment involving the vagus nerve

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy using a pacemaker-like device implanted
in the chest is a treatment used since 1997 to control seizures in epilepsy
patients and has recently been approved for treating drug-resistant cases of
clinical depression.[3] A convenient, non-invasive VNS device that stimulates
an afferent branch of the vagus nerve is also being developed and will soon
undergo trials.

VNS may also be achieved by one of the vagal maneuvers: holding the breath for
a few seconds, dipping the face in cold water, coughing, or tensing the
stomach muscles as if to bear down to have a bowel movement (valsalva
maneuver).[4] Patients with supraventricular tachycardia,[4] atrial
fibrillation, and other illnesses may be trained to perform vagal maneuvers
(or find one or more on their own).

Vagus nerve blocking (VBLOC) therapy, similar to VNS but only used during the
day, has caused 31 obese participants in a six month open label trial
involving three medical centers in Australia, Mexico and Norway to lose an
average of nearly 15 percent of their excess weight. A one year 300
participant double blind phase II trial has begun.[5]

Vagotomy (cutting of the vagus nerve) is a now-obsolete therapy that was
performed for peptic ulcer disease. Vagotomy is currently being researched as
a less invasive alternative weight loss procedure to gastric bypass
surgery.[6] The procedure curbs the feeling of hunger and is sometimes
performed in conjunction with putting bands on patients' stomachs, resulting
in average weight loss of 43% at six months with diet and exercise.[7] Five
pencil-sized scars are the result of the procedure.

## [edit] Physical and emotional effects

Activation of the vagus nerve typically leads to a reduction in heart rate,
blood pressure, or both. This occurs commonly in the setting of
gastrointestinal illness such as viral gastroenteritis or acute cholecystitis,
or in response to other stimuli, including carotid sinus massage, Valsalva
maneuver, or pain from any cause, particularly having blood drawn. When the
circulatory changes are great enough, vasovagal syncope results. Relative
dehydration tends to amplify these responses.

Excessive activation of the vagal nerve during emotional stress, which is a
parasympathetic overcompensation of a strong sympathetic nervous system
response associated with stress, can also cause vasovagal syncope because of a
sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. Vasovagal syncope affects young
children and women more often. It can also lead to temporary loss of bladder
control under moments of extreme fear.

Research has shown that women who have complete transection of the spinal cord
can experience orgasms through the vagus nerve, which can go from the uterus,
cervix and probably the vagina to the brain.[8][9]

## [edit] Effects of vagus nerve lesions

The patient complains of hoarse voice, difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia)
and choking when drinking fluid. There is also loss of gag reflex. Uvula
deviates away from the side of lesion and there is failure of palate
elevation.
