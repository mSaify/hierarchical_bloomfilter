An ion is an atom or molecule which has lost or gained one or more electrons,
giving it a positive or negative electrical charge. According to the Model of
Bohr this will be from or in the outer shield 'n'.

A negatively charged ion, which has more electrons than it has protons, is
known as an anion (á¼Î½Î¬ ana: Greek 'up') (pronounced /ËÃ¦naÉªÉn/; an-eye-
on). Conversely, a positively-charged ion, which has fewer electrons than
protons, is known as a cation (ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¬ kata: Greek 'down') (pronounced
/ËkÃ¦taÉªÉn/; cat-eye-on).

An ion consisting of a single atom is called a monatomic ion, but if it
consists of two or more atoms, it is a polyatomic ion. Polyatomic ions
containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called oxyanions.

Ions are denoted in the same way as electrically neutral atoms and molecules
except for the presence of a superscript indicating the sign of the net
electric charge and the number of electrons lost or gained, if more than one.
For example: H+ and SO42â.

## [edit] Formation

### [edit] Formation of polyatomic and molecular ions

Polyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the combination of elemental
ions such as H+ with neutral molecules or by the gain of such elemental ions
from neutral molecules. A simple example of this is the ammonium ion NH4+
which can be formed by ammonia NH3 accepting a proton, H+. Ammonia and
ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same electronic
configuration but differ in protons. The charge has been added by the addition
of a proton (H+) not the addition or removal of electrons. The distinction
between this and the removal of an electron from the whole molecule is
important in large systems because it usually results in much more stable ions
with complete electron shells. For example NH3Â·+ is not stable because of an
incomplete valence shell around nitrogen and is in fact a radical ion.

### [edit] Ionization potential

Main article: Ionization potential

The energy required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an
atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the
ionization potential, or ionization energy. The nth ionization energy of an
atom is the energy required to detach its nth electron after the first n â 1
electrons have already been detached.

Each successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last.
Particularly great increases occur after any given block of atomic orbitals is
exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that leave
them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one valence electron,
in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost
electron, as Na+. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven
valence electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained
electron, as Clâ. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all
the elements and helium has the greatest[1]. The ionization energy of metals
is generally much lower than the ionization energy of nonmetals, which is why
metals will generally lose electrons to form positively-charged ions while
nonmetals will generally gain electrons to form negatively-charged ions

A neutral atom contains an equal number of Z protons in the nucleus and Z
electrons in the electron shell. The electrons' negative charges thus exactly
cancel the protons' positive charges. In the simple view of the Free electron
model, a passing electron is therefore not attracted to a neutral atom and
cannot bind to it. In reality, however, the atomic electrons form a cloud into
which the additional electron penetrates, thus being exposed to a net positive
charge part of the time. Furthermore, the additional charge displaces the
original electrons and all of the Z + 1 electrons rearrange into a new
configuration.

## [edit] Ions

  * Anions are negatively charged ions, formed when an atom gains electrons in a reaction. Anions are negatively charged because there are more electrons associated with them than there are protons in their nuclei.

  * Cations are positively charged ions, formed when an atom loses electrons in a reaction. Cations are the opposite of anions, since cations have fewer electrons than protons.

  * Radicals or radical ions are atom groups that contain unpaired electrons and are highly reactive.

## [edit] Ionic bonding

An ionic bond is a type of chemical bond that involves a metal and a non-metal
ion (or polyatomic ions such as ammonium) through electrostatic attraction. In
short, it is a bond formed by the attraction between two oppositely charged
ions.

The metal donates one or more electrons, forming a positively charged ion or
cation with a stable electron configuration. These electrons then enter the
non metal, causing it to form a negatively charged ion or anion which also has
a stable electron configuration. The electrostatic attraction between the
oppositely charged ions causes them to come together and form a bond.

For example, common table salt is sodium chloride. When sodium (Na) and
chlorine (Cl) are combined, the sodium atoms each lose an electron, forming a
cation (Na+), and the chlorine atoms each gain an electron to form an anion
(Cl-). These ions are then attracted to each other in a 1:1 ratio to form
sodium chloride (NaCl).

Electron configurations of lithium and fluorine. Lithium has one electron in
its outer shell, held rather loosely because the ionization energy is low.
Fluorine carries 7 electrons in its outer shell. When one electron moves from
lithium to fluorine, each ion acquires the noble gas configuration. The
bonding energy from the electrostatic attraction of the two oppositely-charged
ions has a large enough negative value that the overall bonded state energy is
lower than the unbonded stateThe removal of electrons from the atoms is
endothermic and causes the ions to have a higher energy. There may also be
energy changes associated with breaking of existing bonds or the addition of
more than one electron to form anions. However, the attraction of the ions to
each other lowers their energy.

Ionic bonding will occur only if the overall energy change for the reaction is
favourable â when the bonded atoms have a lower energy than the free ones.
The larger the resulting energy change the stronger the bond. The low
electronegativity of metals and high electronegativity of non-metals means
that the energy change of the reaction is most favorable when metals lose
electrons and non-metals gain electrons. An ionic bond doesn't need metal.

Pure ionic bonding is not known to exist. All ionic compounds have a degree of
covalent bonding. The larger the difference in electronegativity between two
atoms, the more ionic the bond. Ionic compounds conduct electricity when
molten or in solution. They generally have a high melting point and tend to be
soluble in water.

## [edit] Plasma

Main article: Plasma (physics)

A collection of non-aqueous gas-like ions, or even a gas containing a
proportion of charged particles, is called a plasma, often called the fourth
state of matter because its properties are quite different from solids,
liquids, and gases. Astrophysical plasmas containing predominantly a mixture
of electrons and protons, may make up as much as 99.9% of visible matter in
the universe.[2]

## [edit] Applications

Ions are essential to life. Sodium, potassium, calcium and other ions play an
important role in the cells of living organisms, particularly in cell
membranes. They have many practical, everyday applications in items such as
smoke detectors, and are also finding use in unconventional technologies such
as ion engines. Inorganic dissolved ions are a component of total dissolved
solids, an indicator of water quality in the world.
