### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

English orthography is the alphabetic spelling system used by the English
language. English orthography, like other alphabetic orthographies, uses a set
of rules that generally governs how speech sounds are represented in writing.
English has relatively complicated spelling rules when compared to other
languages with alphabetic orthographies. Because of the complex history of the
English language, nearly every sound can be legitimately spelled in more than
one way, and many spellings can be pronounced in more than one way.

## [edit] Function of the letters

Note: In the following discussion, only one or two common pronunciations of
American and British English varieties are used in this article for each word
cited. Other regional pronunciations may be possible for some words, but
indicating all possible regional variants in the article is impractical.

### [edit] Phonemic representation

Further information: Phonemic orthography

Like most alphabetic systems, letters in English orthography may represent a
particular sound. For example, the word cat (pronounced /kÃ¦t/) consists of
three letters c, a, and t, in which c represents the sound /k/, a the sound
/Ã¦/, and t the sound /t/.

Single letters or multiple sequences of letters may provide this function.
Thus, the single letter c in the word cat represents the single sound /k/. In
the word ship (pronounced /ÊÉªp/), the digraph sh (two letters) represents
the sound /Ê/. In the word ditch, the three letters tch represent the sound
/tÊ/.

Less commonly, a single letter can represent more than one sound. The most
common example is the letter x, which often represents more than one sound as
in the prefix ex- where it represents the consonant cluster /ks/ (for example,
in the word ex-wife, pronounced /ÉkswaÉªf/).

The same letter (or sequence of letters) may indicate different sounds when
the letter occurs in different positions. For instance, the digraph gh
represents the sound /f/ at the end of single-syllable, single-morpheme words,
such as cough (pronounced /kÉf/ in many dialects of American English). At the
beginning of syllables (i.e. the syllable onset), the digraph gh represents
the sound /g/, such as in the word ghost (pronounced /gost/ or /gÉÊst/).
Furthermore, the sound value represented by a particular letter (or letters)
is often restricted by its position within the word. Thus, the digraph gh
never represents the sound /f/ in syllable onsets and never represents the
sound /g/ in syllable codas. (Incidentally, this shows that ghoti does not
follow English spelling rules to sound like fish.)

### [edit] Word origin

See also: Hard and soft C, Hard and soft G, and Silent k

Another type of spelling characteristic is related to word origin. For
example, when representing a vowel, the letter y in non-word-final positions
represents the sound /Éª/ in some words borrowed from Greek (reflecting an
original upsilon), whereas the letter usually representing this sound in non-
Greek words is the letter i. Thus, the word myth (pronounced /mÉªÎ¸/) is of
Greek origin, while pith (pronounced /pÉªÎ¸/) is a Germanic word. Other
examples include th representing /t/ (which is usually represented by t), ph
representing /f/ (which is usually represented by f), and ch representing /k/
(which is usually represented by c or k) â the use of these spellings for
these sounds often mark words that have been borrowed from Greek.

Some, such as Brengelman (1970), have suggested that, in addition to this
marking of word origin, these spellings indicate a more formal level of style
or register in a given text, although Rollins (2004) finds this point to be
exaggerated as there would be many exceptions where a word with one of these
spellings, such as ph for /f/ (like telephone), could occur in an informal
text.

### [edit] Homophone differentiation

Letters are also used to distinguish between homophones (words with the same
pronunciation) that would otherwise have the same pronunciation and spelling
but different meanings. The words hour and our are pronounced identically in
some dialects (as /aÊÉ/ or /aÊr/). However, they are distinguished from
each other orthographically by the addition of the letter h. Another example
of this is the homophones plain and plane where both are pronounced /pleÉªn/,
but are marked with two different orthographic representations of the vowel
/eÉª/.[1]

In written language, this may help to resolve potential ambiguities that would
arise otherwise (cf. He's breaking the car vs. He's braking the car). This can
be seen in a positive light since with written language (unlike spoken
language) the reader usually has no recourse to ask the writer for
clarification (whereas in a conversation, the listener can ask the speaker
about lexical uncertainties). Some proponents of spelling reform view
homophones as undesirable and would prefer that they be eliminated. Doing so,
however, would increase orthographic ambiguities that would need to be
resolved via the linguistic context.

### [edit] Marking sound changes in other letters

See also: Silent e

Another function of English letters is to provide information about other
aspects of pronunciation or the word itself. Rollins (2004) uses the term
"markers" for letters with this function. Letters may mark different types of
information. One common type of marking is that of a different pronunciation
of another letter within the word. An example of this is the letter e in the
word cottage (pronounced /kÉtÉªdÊ/ or /kÉtÉªdÊ/). Here e indicates that
the preceding g should represent the sound /dÊ/. This contrasts with the more
common value of g in word-final position as the sound /g/, such as in tag
(pronounced /tÃ¦É¡/).

A particular letter may have more than one pronunciation-marking role. Besides
the marking of word-final g as indicating /dÊ/ as in cottage, the letter e
may also mark an altered pronunciation for other vowels. In the pair ban and
bane, the a of ban has the value /Ã¦/, whereas the a of bane is marked by the
e as having the value /eÉª/.

### [edit] Functionless letters

Further information: Silent letter

Other letters have no linguistic function. For example, there is a general
"graphotactic" constraint in English orthography against words that end in the
letter v. Thus, in order to satisfy this constraint, syllable-final v is
followed by the letter e, such as in the word give. Spellings such as rev and
slav are extremely rare.

### [edit] Multiple functionality

A given letter or (letters) may have dual functions. For example, the letter i
in the word cinema has a sound-representing function (representing the sound
/Éª/) and a pronunciation-marking function (marking the c as having the value
/s/ opposed to the value /k/).

### [edit] Underlying representation

Like many other alphabetic orthographies, English spelling does not represent
non-contrastive phonetic sounds (that is, sub-phonemic sounds). The fact that
the letter t is pronounced with aspiration [tÊ°] at the beginning of words is
never indicated in the spelling, and, indeed, this phonetic detail is probably
not noticeable to the average native speaker not trained in the phonetics.
However, unlike some orthographies, English orthography often represents a
very abstract underlying representation (or morphophonemic form) of English
words.[2]

â [T]he postulated underlying forms are systematically related to the
conventional orthography ... and are, as is well known, related to the
underlying forms of a much earlier historical stage of the language. There
has, in other words, been little change in lexical representation since Middle
English, and, consequently, we would expect ... that lexical representation
would differ very little from dialect to dialect in Modern English ... [and]
that conventional orthography is probably fairly close to optimal for all
modern English dialects, as well as for the attested dialects of the past
several hundred years.[3] â  
In these cases, a given morpheme (i.e. a component of a word) is represented
with a single spelling despite the fact that it is pronounced differently
(i.e. has different surface representations) in different environments. An
example is the past tense suffix -ed, which may be pronounced variously as
[t], [d], or [Éªd] (for example, dip [dÉªp], dipped [dÉªpt], boom [bum],
boomed [bumd], loot [lut], looted [lutÉªd]). Because these different
pronunciations of -ed can be predicted by a few phonological rules, only a
single spelling is needed in the orthography.

Another example involves the vowel differences (with accompanying stress
pattern changes) in several related words. For instance, the word photographer
is derived from the word photograph by adding the derivational suffix -er.
When this suffix is added, the vowel pronunciations change:

     Spelling Pronunciation  
photograph [ËfotÉgrÃ¦f] or [ËfÉÊtÉgrÉËf]  
photographer [fÉËtÉgrÉfÉr] or [fÉËtÉgrÉfÉ]  
It may be argued[who?] that the underlying representation of photo is a single
phonological form, such as |fotÉgrÉËf|. Since the (surface) pronunciation
of the vowels can be predicted by phonological rules according to the
different stress patterns, the orthography only needs to have one spelling
that corresponds to the underlying form. Other examples of this type, include
words with the -ity suffix (as in agile vs agility, acid vs acidity, divine vs
divinity, sane vs sanity, etc.). (See also: Trisyllabic laxing.)

Another example includes words like sign (pronounced [saÉªn]) and bomb
(pronounced [bÉm] or [bÉm]) where the "silent" letters g and b,
respectively, seem to be "inert" letters with no functional role. However,
there are the related words signature and bombard in which the so-called
"silent" letters are pronounced [sÉªÉ¡nÉtÊÉr] and [bÉmbÉrd] or
[bÉmbÉËd], respectively. Here it may be argued[who?] that the underlying
representation of sign and bomb is |saÉªgn| and |bÉmb| or |bÉmb|, in which
the underlying |g| and |b| are only pronounced in the surface forms when
followed by certain suffixes (-ature, -ard). Otherwise, the |g| and |b| are
not realized in the surface pronunciation (e.g. when standing alone, or when
followed by suffixes like -ing or -er). In these cases, the orthography
indicates the underlying consonants that are present in certain words but are
absent in other related words. Other examples include the t in fast [fÃ¦st] /
[fÉËst] and fasten [fÃ¦sÉn] / [fÉËsÉn] and the h in heir [Ér] / [ÉÉ]
and inherit [ÉªnhÉrÉªt].

Another example includes words like mean (pronounced [min]) and meant
(pronounced [mÉnt]). Here the vowel spelling ea is pronounced differently in
the two related words. Thus, again the orthography uses only a single spelling
that corresponds to the single morphemic form rather than to the surface
phonological form.

English orthography does not always provide an underlying representation;
sometimes it provides an intermediate representation between the underlying
form and the surface pronunciation. This is the case with the spelling of the
regular plural morpheme, which is written as either -s (as in tick, ticks and
mite, mites) or -es (as in box, boxes). Here the spelling -s is pronounced
either [s] or [z] (depending on the environment, e.g. ticks [tÉªks] and pigs
[pÉªÉ¡z]) while -es is pronounced [Éªz] (e.g. boxes [bÉksÉªz] or [bÉksÉªz]).
Thus, there are two different spellings that correspond to the single
underlying representation |-z| of the plural suffix and the three surface
forms. The spelling indicates the insertion of [Éª] before the [z] in the
spelling -es, but does not indicate the devoiced [s] distinctly from the
unaffected [z] in the spelling -s.

The abstract representation of words as indicated by the orthography can be
considered to be advantageous since the etymological relationships between
words are very apparent to English readers. This makes writing English more
complex, but arguably makes reading English more efficient.[4]

However, very abstract underlying representations, such as that of Chomsky &
Halle (1968) or of underspecification theories, are sometimes considered too
abstract to accurately reflect the linguistic knowledge of native speakers.
Followers of these arguments believe the less abstract surface forms are more
"psychologically real" and thus more useful in terms of pedagogy.[5]

## [edit] Spelling patterns

### [edit] Spelling to sound correspondences

#### [edit] Vowels

In a generative approach to English spelling, Rollins (2004) identifies twenty
main orthographic vowels of stressed syllables that are grouped into four main
categories: "Lax", "Tense", "Heavy", "Tense-R". (As this classification is
based on orthography, not all orthographic "lax" vowels are necessarily
phonologically lax.)

cur /jÊÉ/  
cure  
u /Ê/  
push /uË/  
rude \-- /ÊÉ/  
sure  
For instance, the letter a can represent the lax vowel /Ã¦/, tense /eÉª/,
heavy /Ér/ or /ÉË/, or tense-r /Ér/ or /ÉÉ/. Heavy and tense-r vowels
are the respective lax and tense counterparts followed by the letter r.

Tense vowels are distinguished from lax vowels with a "silent" e letter that
is added at the end of words. Thus, the letter a in hat is lax /Ã¦/, but when
the letter e is added in the word hate the letter a is tense /eÉª/. Similarly,
heavy and tense-r vowels pattern together: the letters ar in car are heavy
/ÉË(r)/, the letters ar followed by silent e in the word care are /ÉÉ(r)/.
The letter u represents two different vowel patterns, one being /Ê - ju -
É(r) - jÊ(r)/, the other /Ê - u - Ê(r)/. There is no distinction between
heavy and tense-r vowels with the letter o, and the letter u in the
/Ê-u-Ê(r)/ pattern does not have a heavy vowel member.

Besides silent e, another strategy for indicating tense and tense-r vowels, is
the addition of another orthographic vowel forming a digraph. In this case,
the first vowel is usually the main vowel while the second vowel is the
"marking" vowel. For example, the word man has a lax a pronounced /Ã¦/, but
with the addition of i (as the digraph ai) in the word main the a is marked as
tense and pronounced /eÉª/. These two strategies produce words that are
spelled differently but pronounced identically, as in mane (silent e
strategy), main (digraph strategy) and Maine (both strategies). The use of two
different strategies relates to the function of distinguishing between words
that would otherwise be homonyms.

Besides the 20 basic vowel spellings, Rollins (2004) has a reduced vowel
category (representing the sounds /É, Éª/) and a miscellaneous category
(representing the sounds /ÉÉª, aÊ, aÉªr, aÊr/ and /j/+V, /w/+V, V+V).

Notes:

  * In the tables, the hyphen has two different meanings. A hyphen after the letter indicates that it must be at the beginning of a syllable, eg j- in jumper and ajar. A hyphen before the letter indicates that it cannot be at the beginning of a word, eg -ck in sick and ticket.
  * More specific rules take precedence over more general ones, eg 'c- before e, i or y' takes precedence over 'c'.
  * Where the letter combination is described as 'word-final', inflectional suffixes may be added without changing the pronunciation, eg catalogues.
  * The dialect used is RP.
  * Isolated foreign borrowings are excluded.
  * This[clarification needed] relies highly on knowledge of where the stress in a word is, but English has no consistent way of showing stress.

### [edit] Sound to spelling correspondences

The following table shows for each sound, the various spelling patterns used
to denote it. The symbol "â¦" stands for an intervening consonant. The letter
sequences are in order of frequency with the most common first. Some of these
patterns are very rare or unique, such as au for the Ã¦ sound in laugh (some
accents). In some cases, the spellings shown are found in only one known
English word (such as "mh" for /m/, or "yrrh" for /Ér/).

## [edit] Diacritics

Main article: English words with diacritics

English includes some words that can be written with accent marks. These words
have mostly been imported from other languages, usually French. But it is
increasingly rare for writers of English to actually use the accent marks for
common words, even in very formal writing. The strongest tendency to retain
the accent is in words that are atypical of English morphology and therefore
still perceived as slightly foreign. For example, cafÃ© and pÃ¢tÃ© both have a
pronounced final e, which would be "silent" by the normal English
pronunciation rules.

Some examples: appliquÃ©, attachÃ©, blasÃ©, bric-Ã -brac, brÃ¶tchen,[6] cafÃ©,
clichÃ©, crÃ¨me, crÃªpe, faÃ§ade, fiancÃ©(e), flambÃ©, naÃ¯ve, naÃ¯vetÃ©,
nÃ©(e), papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, passÃ©, piÃ±ata, protÃ©gÃ©, raison dâÃªtre,
rÃ©sumÃ©, risquÃ©, Ã¼ber-, vis-Ã -vis, voilÃ .

Some words such as rÃ´le and hÃ´tel were first seen with accents when they
were borrowed into English, but now the accent is almost never used. The words
were considered very French borrowings when first used in English, even
accused by some of being foreign phrases used where English alternatives would
suffice, but today their French origin is largely forgotten. The accent on
"Ã©lite" has disappeared from most publications today, though Time and the New
Yorker magazines still use it. For some words such as "soupÃ§on" however, the
only spelling found in English dictionaries (the Oxford English Dictionary and
others) uses the diacritic.

Italics, with appropriate accents, are generally applied to foreign terms that
are uncommonly used in or have not been assimilated into English: for example,
adiÃ³s, coup d'Ã©tat, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, raison d'Ãªtre,
Ã¼ber (Ã¼bermensch), vis-Ã -vis.

It was formerly common in English to use a diaeresis mark to indicate a
hiatus: for example, coÃ¶perate, daÃ¯s, reÃ«lect. The New Yorker and
Technology Review magazines still use it for this purpose, even though this
increasingly rare in modern English. Nowadays the diaeresis is normally left
out (cooperate), or a hyphen is used (co-operate). It is, however, still
common in loanwords such as naÃ¯ve and noÃ«l.

Written accents are also used occasionally in poetry and scripts for dramatic
performances to indicate that a certain normally unstressed syllable in a word
should be stressed for dramatic effect, or to keep with the metre of the
poetry. This use is frequently seen in archaic and pseudoarchaic writings with
the "-ed" suffix, to indicate that the "e" should be fully pronounced, as with
cursÃ¨d.

In certain older texts (typically British), the use of ligatures is common in
words such as archÃ¦ology, diarrhÅa, and encyclopÃ¦dia. Such words have Latin
or Greek origin. Nowadays, the ligatures have been generally replaced in
British English by the separated digraph "ae" and "oe" ("encyclopaedia",
"diarrhoea"; but usually "economy", "ecology") and in American English by "e"
("encyclopedia", "diarrhea"; but usually "paean", "amoeba", "oedipal",
"Caesar").[7]

## [edit] Irregularities

<IMG>

The English spelling system, compared to the systems used in other languages,
is quite irregular and complex. Although French presents a similar degree of
difficulty when encoding (writing), English is more difficult when decoding
(reading)[citation needed]. English has never had any formal regulating
authority, like the Spanish Real Academia EspaÃ±ola, Italian Accademia della
Crusca or the French AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise, so attempts to regularize or reform
the language, including spelling reform, have usually met with failure.

The only significant exceptions were the reforms of Noah Webster which
resulted in many of the differences between British and American spelling,
such as center/centre, and dialog/dialogue. (Other differences, such as
-ize/-ise in realize/realise etc, came about separately; see American and
British English spelling differences for details.)

Besides the quirks the English spelling system has inherited from its past,
there are other idiosyncrasies in spelling that make it tricky to learn.
English contains 24-27 (depending on dialect) separate consonant phonemes and,
depending on dialect, anywhere from fourteen to twenty vowels. However, there
are only 26 letters in the modern English alphabet, so there cannot be a one-
to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. Many sounds are spelled
using different letters or multiple letters, and for those words whose
pronunciation is predictable from the spelling, the sounds denoted by the
letters depend on the surrounding letters. For example, the digraph "th"
represents two different sounds (the voiced interdental fricative and the
voiceless interdental fricative) (see Pronunciation of English th), and the
voiceless alveolar fricative can be represented by the letters "s" and "c".

Furthermore, in most recent loanwords, English makes no attempt to Anglicise
the spellings of these words, and preserves the foreign spellings, even when
they employ exotic conventions, like the Polish "cz" in "Czech" or the Old
Norse "fj" in "fjord" (although New Zealand English exclusively spells it
"fiord"). In fact, instead of loans being respelled to conform to English
spelling standards, sometimes the pronunciation changes as a result of
pressure from the spelling. One example of this is the word "ski", which was
adopted from Norwegian in the mid-18th century, although it didn't become
common until 1900. It used to be pronounced "shee", which is similar to the
Norwegian pronunciation, but the increasing popularity of the sport after the
middle of the 20th century helped the "sk" pronunciation replace it.[citations
needed]

Of course, such a philosophy can be taken too far. For instance, there was
also a period when the spellings of words was altered in what is now regarded
as a misguided attempt to make them conform to what were perceived to be the
etymological origins of the words. For example, the letter "b" was added to
"debt" in an attempt to link it to the Latin debitum, and the letter "s" in
"island" is a misplaced attempt to link it to Latin insula instead of the
Norse word igland, which is the true origin of the English word. The letter
"p" in "ptarmigan" has no etymological justification whatsoever. Some are just
randomly changed: for example, 'score' used to be spelled 'skor'.[citations
needed]

The spelling of English continues to evolve. Many loanwords come from
languages where the pronunciation of vowels corresponds to the way they were
pronounced in Old English, which is similar to the Italian or Spanish
pronunciation of the vowels, and is the value the vowel symbols [a], [e], [i],
[o], and [u] have in the International Phonetic Alphabet. As a result, there
is a somewhat regular system of pronouncing "foreign" words in English, and
some borrowed words have had their spelling changed to conform to this system.
For example, Hindu used to be spelled "Hindoo", and the name "Maria" used to
be pronounced like the name "Mariah", but was changed to conform to this
system. It has been argued that this influence probably started with the
introduction of many Italian words into English during the Renaissance, in
fields like music, from which come the words "andante", "viola", "forte",
etc.[citations needed]

Commercial advertisers have also had an effect on English spelling. In
attempts to differentiate their products from others,[citation needed] they
introduce new or simplified spellings like "lite" instead of "light", "thru"
instead of "through", "smokey" instead of "smoky" (for "smokey bacon" flavour
crisps), and "rucsac" instead of "rucksack". The spellings of personal names
have also been a source of spelling innovations: affectionate versions of
women's names that sound the same as men's names have been spelled
differently: Nikki and Nicky, Toni and Tony, Jo and Joe.

As examples of the idiosyncratic nature of English spelling, the combination
"ou" can be pronounced in at least seven different ways: /É/ in "famous",
/ÉË/ in "journey", /aÊ/ in "loud", /Ê/ in "should", /uË/ in "you",
/aÊÉ/ in "flour", /ÉË/ in "tour"; and the vowel sound /iË/ in "me" can be
spelt in at least ten different ways: "paediatric", "me", "seat", "seem",
"ceiling", "people", "chimney", "machine", "siege", "phoenix". (These examples
assume a more-or-less standard non-regional British English accent. Other
accents will vary.)

Sometimes everyday speakers of English change a counterintuitive pronunciation
simply because it is counterintuitive. Changes like this are not usually seen
as "standard", but can become standard if used enough. An example is the word
"miniscule", which still competes with its original spelling of "minuscule",
though this might also be because of analogy with the word "mini".[citation
needed]

### [edit] "Ough" words

Main article: Ough (combination)

The most notorious group of letters in the English language, ough, is commonly
pronounced at least ten different ways, six of which are illustrated in the
construct, Though the tough cough and hiccough plough him through, which is
quoted by Robert A. Heinlein in The Door into Summer to illustrate the
difficulties facing automated speech transcription and reading. Ough is in
fact a word in its own right; it is an exclamation of disgust similar to
"ugh".

  * though: /oÊ/ as in toe;
  * tough: /Êf/ as in cuff;
  * cough: /Éf, Êf/ as in off;
  * hiccough (a now uncommon variant of hiccup): /Êp/ as in up;
  * plough (no longer used in American English): /aÊ/ as in cow;
  * through: /u/ as in boo.

## [edit] History of the English spelling system

Throughout the history of the English language, these inconsistencies have
gradually increased in number. There are a number of contributing factors.
First, gradual changes in pronunciation, such as the Great Vowel Shift,
account for a tremendous number of irregularities. Second, relatively recent
loan words from other languages generally carry their original spellings,
which are often not phonetic in English. The Romanization of languages (e.g.,
Chinese) using alphabets derived from the Latin alphabet has further
complicated this problem, for example when pronouncing Chinese place names.
Third, some prescriptivists have had partial success in their attempts to
normalize the English language, forcing a change in spelling but not in
pronunciation.

The regular spelling system of Old English was swept away by the Norman
Conquest, and English itself was eclipsed by French for three centuries,
eventually emerging with its spelling much influenced by French. English had
also borrowed large numbers of words from French, which for reasons of
prestige and familiarity kept their French spellings. The spelling of Middle
English, such as in the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer, is very irregular and
inconsistent, with the same word being spelled differently, sometimes even in
the same sentence. However, these were generally much better guides to
pronunciation than modern English spelling can honestly claim.

For example, the sound /Ê/, normally written u, is spelled with an o in son,
love, come, etc., due to Norman spelling conventions which prohibited writing
u before v, m, n due to the graphical confusion that would result. (v, u, n
were identically written with two minims in Norman handwriting; w was written
as two u letters; m was written with three minims, hence mm looked like vun,
nvu, uvu, etc.) Similarly, spelling conventions also prohibited final v. Hence
the identical spellings of the three different vowel sounds in love, grove and
prove are due to ambiguity in the Middle English spelling system, not sound
change.

There was also a series of linguistic sound changes towards the end of this
period, including the Great Vowel Shift, which resulted in "i" in "mine"
changing from a pure vowel to a diphthong. These changes for the most part did
not detract from the rule-governed nature of the spelling system; but in some
cases they introduced confusing inconsistencies, like the well-known example
of the many pronunciations of "ough" (rough, through, though, trough, plough,
etc.). Most of these changes happened before the arrival of printing in
England. However, the arrival of the printing press merely froze the current
system, rather than providing the impetus for a realignment of spelling with
pronunciation. Furthermore, it introduced further inconsistencies, partly
because of the use of typesetters trained abroad, particularly in the Low
Countries. For example, the "h" in "ghost" was influenced by Dutch.[8] The
addition and deletion of a silent "e" at the ends of words was also sometimes
used to make the right-hand margin line up more neatly.[8]

By the time dictionaries were introduced in the mid 1600s, the spelling system
of English started to stabilize, and by the 1800s, most words had set
spellings.
