John Keats (IPA: /ËkiËts/; 31 October 1795 â 23 February 1821) was an
English poet who became one of the key poets of the English Romantic movement
during the early nineteenth century. During his very short life, his work
received constant critical attacks from periodicals of the day, but his
posthumous influence on poets such as Alfred Tennyson has been immense.
Elaborate word choice and sensual imagery characterize Keats's poetry,
including a series of odes that were his masterpieces and which remain among
the most popular poems in English literature. Keats's letters, which expound
on his aesthetic theory of "negative capability"[1], are among the most
celebrated by any writer.

## [edit] Life

John Keats was born in 1795 at 85 Moorgate in London, England, where his
father, Thomas Keats, was a hostler. The pub is now called 'Keats at the
Globe', only a few yards from Moorgate station. Keats was baptized at St
Botolph-without-Bishopsgate and lived happily for the first seven years of his
life. The beginnings of his troubles occurred in 1804, when his father died of
a fractured skull after falling from his horse. A year later, in 1805, Keats'
grandfather died. His mother, Frances Jennings Keats, remarried soon
afterwards, but quickly left the new husband and moved herself and her four
children (a son had died in infancy) to live with Keats's grandmother, Alice
Jennings. There, Keats attended a school that first instilled a love of
literature in him.

Keats's grave in Rome

In 1810 his mother died of tuberculosis, leaving him and his siblings in the
custody of their grandmother who appointed two guardians to take care of her
new "charges". They removed Keats from his old school to become a surgeon's
apprentice at Thomas Hammond's apothecary shop in Edmonton [2] (now part of
the London Borough of Enfield). This continued until 1814, when, after a fight
with his master, he left his apprenticeship and became a student at Guy's
Hospital (now part of King's College London, University of London). During
that year, he devoted more and more of his time to the study of literature.
Keats traveled to the Isle of Wight in the spring of 1819, where he spent a
week. Later that year he stayed in Winchester. It was here that Keats wrote
Isabella, St. Agnes' Eve and Lamia. Parts of Hyperion and the five-act poetic
tragedy Otho The Great were also written in Winchester.

Following the death of his grandmother, he soon found his brother, Tom Keats,
entrusted to his care. Tom was suffering, as his mother had, from
tuberculosis. Finishing his epic poem "Endymion", Keats left to work in
Scotland and Ireland with his friend Charles Armitage Brown. However, he too
began to show signs of tuberculosis infection on that trip, and returned
prematurely. When he did, he found that Tom's condition had deteriorated, and
that Endymion had, as had Poems before it, been the target of much abuse from
the critics. On 1 December 1818, Tom Keats died of his disease, and John Keats
moved again, to live in Brown's house in Hampstead, next to Hampstead Heath.
There he lived next door to Fanny Brawne, who had been staying there with her
mother. He then quickly fell in love with Fanny. However, it was overall an
unhappy affair for the poet; Keats's ardour for her seemed to bring him more
vexation than comfort. The later (posthumous) publication of their
correspondence was to scandalise Victorian society. In the diary of Fanny
Brawne was found only one sentence regarding the separation: "Mr. Keats has
left Hampstead." Fanny's letters to Keats were, as the poet had requested,
destroyed upon his death. However, in 1937, a collection of 31 letters,
written by Fanny Brawne to Keats's sister, Frances, were published by Oxford
University Press. While these letters revealed the depth of Brawne's feelings
toward Keats and in many ways attempted to redeem her rather promiscuous
reputation, it is arguable whether or not they succeeded.

Life and Death masks in Rome

This relationship was cut short when, by 1820, Keats began showing serious
signs of tuberculosis, the disease that had plagued his family. On the
suggestion of his doctors, he left the cold airs of London behind and moved to
Italy with his friend Joseph Severn. Keats moved into a house, which is now a
museum that is dedicated to his life and work, The Keats-Shelley House, on the
Spanish Steps, in Rome, where despite attentive care from Severn and Dr. John
Clark, the poet's health rapidly deteriorated.

He died in 1821 and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome. His last
request was to be buried under a tombstone reading, "Here lies One Whose Name
was writ in Water." His name was not to appear on the stone. Despite these
requests, however, Severn and Brown also added the epitaph: "This Grave
contains all that was mortal, of a YOUNG ENGLISH POET, who on his Death Bed,
in the Bitterness of his heart, at the Malicious Power of his enemies, desired
these words to be Engraven on his Tomb Stone" along with the image of a lyre
with broken strings.

the house in the right foreground, which is now a museum.

Shelley blamed Keats' death on an article published shortly before in the
Quarterly Review, with a scathing attack on Keats' Endymion. The offending
article was long believed to have been written by William Gifford, though
later shown to be the work of John Wilson Croker. Keats's death inspired
Shelley to write the poem Adonais.'; Byron later composed a short poem on this
theme using the phrase "snuffed out by an article." However Byron, far less
admiring of Keats's poetry than Shelley and generally more cynical in nature,
was here probably just as much poking fun at Shelley's interpretation as he
was having a dig at his old fencing partners the critics. (see below, Byron's
other less than serious poem on the same subject).

The largest collection of Keats's letters, manuscripts, and other papers is in
the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Other collections of such material
can be found at the British Library; Keats House, Hampstead; The Keats-Shelley
House, Rome; and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York.

Keats is also a distant relative of the Metaphysical poet, John
Donne.[citation needed]

Portrait, Keats' grave in Rome

  * In Rudyard Kipling's story "Wireless", from his book Traffics and Discoveries (1904), a chemist (or "pharmacist", in American English) with tuberculosis, while dozing under the influence of drugs, reproduces almost perfectly about a dozen lines of Keats' poem "The Eve of St. Agnes", although he has never read Keats. The narrator believes that this remarkable near-perfect reproduction happens because of the combination of the chemist's drug-trance and his having the same illness and profession as Keats, causing him to "pick up" the same "universal spiritual vibrations" that Keats once did. The story at the same time makes fun of the infant science of radio-telegraphy: in the next room a "wireless telegraph" hobbyist is attempting to communicate with a friend, with little success.

  * F. Scott Fitzgerald refers to a line in "Ode to a Nightingale" in the title of his novel Tender Is The Night.

  * Arthur Ransome uses two references from "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer" in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.[3]

  * P.G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention used a phrase from "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer": "Now I understand what that âwhen a new planet swims into his kenâ excitement is all about."[4]

  * J. D. Salinger, in his novella Seymour: An Introduction, introduces the reader to a certain haiku, the authorship of which he attributes to his most complex fictional creation, Seymour Glass. The haiku reads as follows: "John Keats/ John Keats/ John/ Please put your scarf on." (Tuberculosis is a condition aggravated by cold weather.)

  * In allusion to Keat's complaint to Sir Isaac Newton for destroying the beauty of the rainbow, Richard Dawkins names his book Unweaving the Rainbow

  * Dan Simmons's science-fiction novels of the Hyperion Cantos feature two characters with the cloned body of John Keats, as well as his personality (reconstructed and programmed into an AI). Some of the main themes of these novels, as well as their names, draw upon "Hyperion" and "Endymion".

  * A quote from Keats appears in Phillip Pullman's novel The Subtle Knife, "...capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason -" (from a 21 Dec. 1817 letter by Keats on his theory of negative capability).

  * The popular teen series Gossip Girl mention Keats throughout the novels as the male protagonist Daniel Humphrey's poetic hero and is referenced numerous times by the character.

  * In 1977 author Anthony Burgess (A Clockwork Orange, Napoleon Symphony) recreated Keats' last days in Rome in a book entitled ABBA ABBA.

  * Ann Brashares named one of her chapters in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on," from Ode to a Grecian Urn

  * In the introduction to Literary Theory, Terry Eagleton writes, "If you approach me at a bus stop and murmur 'Thou still unravished bride of quietness,' then I am instantly aware that I am in the presence of the literary." What is murmured by the hypothetical bus rider is the first line of Keats' "Ode to a Grecian Urn".

  * In The Bear by William Faulkner, McCaslin Edmonds reads some lines of Ode on a Grecian Urn to Isaac McCaslin :" She cannot fade,though thou hast not thy bliss/ Forever will thou love and she be fair!"
