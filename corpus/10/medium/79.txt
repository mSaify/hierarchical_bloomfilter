Jean DÃ©sirÃ© Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819 â 31 December 1877) was a French
painter who led the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting.

â I am fifty years old and I have always lived in freedom; let me end my
life free; when I am dead let this be said of me: 'He belonged to no school,
to no church, to no institution, to no academy, least of all to any rÃ©gime
except the rÃ©gime of liberty.[1] â

## [edit] Realism

Best known as an innovator in Realism (and credited with coining the term),
Courbet was a painter of figurative compositions, landscapes and seascapes. He
also worked with social issues, and addressed peasantry and the grave working
conditions of the poor. His work belonged neither to the predominant Romantic
nor Neoclassical schools. Rather, Courbet believed the Realist artist's
mission was the pursuit of truth, which would help erase social contradictions
and imbalances.

For Courbet realism dealt not with the perfection of line and form, but
entailed spontaneous and rough handling of paint, suggesting direct
observation by the artist while portraying the irregularities in nature. He
depicted the harshness in life, and in so doing, challenged contemporary
academic ideas of art.

His work, along with the work of HonorÃ© Daumier and Jean-FranÃ§ois Millet,
became known as Realism.

Born in Ornans (Doubs), into a prosperous farming family which wanted him to
study law, he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of Steuben and
Hesse. An independent spirit, he soon left, preferring to develop his own
style by studying Spanish, Flemish and French painters and painting copies of
their work.

His first works were an Odalisque, suggested by the writing of Victor Hugo,
and a LÃ©lia, illustrating George Sand, but he soon abandoned literary
influences for the study of real life.

A trip to the Netherlands in 1847 strengthened Courbet's belief that painters
should portray the life around them, as Rembrandt, Hals, and the other Dutch
masters had done.

Among his early works, he painted his own portrait with his dog, and The Man
with a Pipe, both of which the Paris Salon jury rejected. However, the younger
critics, the Neo-romantics and Realists, loudly sang his praises, and by 1849
Courbet was becoming well known, producing such pictures as After Dinner at
Ornans (for which the Salon awarded him a medal) and The Valley of the Loire.

One of Courbet's most important works is A Burial at Ornans, a canvas
recording an event which he witnessed in September 1848. Courbet's painting of
the funeral of his grand uncle became the first masterpiece in the Realist
style. People who had attended the funeral were used as models for the
painting. Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives;
here Courbet said that he "painted the very people who had been present at the
interment, all the townspeople". The result is a realistic presentation of
them, and of life, in Ornans. The painting caused a fuss with critics and the
public. It is an enormous work, measuring 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters),
depicting a prosaic ritual on a scale which previously would have been
reserved for a religious or royal subject. According to art historian Sarah
Faunce, "In Paris the Burial was judged as a work that had thrust itself into
the grand tradition of history painting, like an upstart in dirty boots
crashing a genteel party, and in terms of that tradition it was of course
found wanting."[2] Then too, the painting lacks the sentimental rhetoric that
was expected in a genre work: Courbet's mourners make no theatrical gestures
of grief, and their faces seemed more caricatured than ennobled. The critics
accused Courbet of a deliberate pursuit of ugliness.[2] Eventually the public
grew more interested in the new Realist approach, and the lavish, decadent
fantasy of Romanticism lost popularity. The artist well understood the
importance of this painting; as Courbet said: "The Burial at Ornans was in
reality the burial of Romanticism."

probable model for L'Origine du monde

The Salon of 1850 found him triumphant with A Burial at Ornans, the Stone-
Breakers (destroyed in 1945), and the Peasants of Flagey. Other figurative
works, with common folk and friends as his subjects, included Village Damsels
(1852), the Wrestlers, Bathers, and A Girl Spinning (1852).

Courbet associated his ideas of realism in art with anarchism, and, having
gained an audience, he promoted democratic and socialist ideas by writing
politically motivated essays and dissertations.

To a friend in 1850 he wrote,

â ...in our so very civilized society it is necessary for me to live the
life of a savage. I must be free even of governments. The people have my
sympathies, I must address myself to them directly.[3] â  
He displayed his monumental The Artist's Studio in 1855. It is an allegory of
his life as a painter, seen as a heroic venture, in which he is flanked by
friends and admirers on the right, and his opposition to the left. Friends on
the right include Charles Baudelaire, and art collector Alfred Bruyas.

The Origin of the World (L'Origine du monde). (1866). Paris: MusÃ©e d'Orsay.

Towards the end of the 1860s, Courbet painted a series of increasingly erotic
works such as Femme nue couchÃ©e. This culminated in The Origin of the World
(L'Origine du monde) (1866), depicting female genitalia, and Sleep (1866),
featuring two women in bed. While banned from public display, the works only
served to increase his notoriety.

On 14 April 1870, Courbet established a "Federation of Artists" (FÃ©dÃ©ration
des artistes) for the free and uncensored expansion of art. The group's
members included AndrÃ© Gill, HonorÃ© Daumier, Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot,
EugÃ¨ne Pottier, Jules Dalou, and Ãdouard Manet.

His refusal of the cross of the Legion of Honour offered to him by Napoleon
III made him immensely popular with those who opposed the current regime, and
in 1871 under the revolutionary Paris Commune he was placed in charge of all
the Paris art museums and saved them from looting mobs. For his insistence in
executing the Communal decree for the destruction of the VendÃ´me Column, he
was designated as responsible for the act and accordingly sentenced on 2
September 1871 by a Versailles court martial to six months in prison and a
fine of 500 francs.

In 1873, the newly elected president Mac-Mahon wanted to resurrect the Column,
and Courbet was singled out to pay the expenses. He then took refuge in
Switzerland to avoid bankruptcy. On 4 May 1877, the estimate of the costs was
finally established: 323,091 fr 68 cent. Courbet was allowed to pay the fine
in yearly installments of 10,000 francs for the next 33 years, until his 91st
birthday.

Courbet died, age 58, in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, of a liver disease
aggravated by heavy drinking on 31 December 1877, a day before the payment of
the first installment was due. (Bernard NoÃ«l, 1978)

### [edit] Notable exhibitions

An exhibition of his works was held in 1882 at the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts.

A major exhibition of Courbet's work, "The Born Rebel Artist", is being held
beginning in 2007 at the Grand Palais, and at the MusÃ©e Fabre (Montpellier,
France) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) during 2008.[4][5]

### [edit] Influence

Courbet's particular kind of realism influenced many artists to follow,
notably among them the German painters of the Leibl circle,[6] James McNeill
Whistler, and Paul CÃ©zanne. Courbet's influence can also be seen in the work
of Edward Hopper, whose "Bridge in Paris" (1906) and "Approaching a City"
(1946) seem Freudian echoes of Courbet's "The Source of the Loue" and "The
Origin of the World." Hopper's "Les Deux Pigeons" (1920) is "infused with the
spirit of Courbet. Lovers on a terrace ardently embrace while the river flows
freely through the forest below them." [7]
