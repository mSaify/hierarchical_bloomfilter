## [edit] Life and work

Born in Highland Park, Illinois on March 24, 1886. [1] He was given his first
camera, a Kodak Bull's-Eye #2, for his 16th birthday, when he began taking
photographs. His favorite hangouts were Chicago parks and a farm owned by his
aunt. Weston met with quick success and the Chicago Art Institute exhibited
his photographs a year later, in 1903. He attended the Illinois College of
Photography.

In 1906, Weston moved to California, where he decided to stay and pursue a
career in photography. He had four sons with his wife, Flora May Chandler
(whom he married in 1909): Edward Chandler (1910), Theodore Brett (1911),
Laurence (1914) and Cole (1919). In 1910, Weston opened his first photographic
studio in Tropico, California (now Glendale) and wrote articles about his
unconventional methods of portraiture for several high-circulation magazines.

In 1922, Weston experienced a transition from pictorialism to straight
photography, becoming "the pioneer of precise and sharp presentation". His
pictures included the human figure as well as items of nature, including
seaside wildlife, plants, and landscapes. Tina Modotti, his professional (and
romantic) partner, often accompanied him to Mexico, creating much gossip in
the media. Weston's sons were also frequent companions, receiving lessons in
photography from their experienced father. Brett and Cole later embarked on
their own careers in the field, along with Weston's grandson Kim and great-
granddaughter Christine.

After 1927, Weston worked mainly with nudes, still life â his shells and
vegetable studies were especially important â and landscape subjects.
Henrietta Shore was a companion in the 1930s; her paintings influenced him to
photograph her shells.[2] After a few exhibitions of his works in New York, he
co-founded Group f/64 in 1932 with Ansel Adams, Willard Van Dyke and others.
The term f/64 referred to a very small aperture setting on a large format
camera, which secured great depth of field, making a photograph appear evenly
sharp from foreground to background. Weston also achieved great sharpness by
not enlarging. He made contact prints from his 4x5" or 8x10" negatives. The
detailed, straight photography that the group espoused was in opposition to
the pictorialist soft-edged methods that were still in fashion at the time.

In 1937 the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation awarded Weston a fellowship, the
first given to a photographer. He married his assistant, Charis Wilson, the
following year (they had lived together since 1934, and divorced in 1946).
During this time he received exclusive commissions and published several
books, some with Wilson, including an edition of Whitman's Leaves of Grass
illustrated with his photographs. He also produced some of his few color
photographs with Willard Van Dyke in 1947. Weston also collaborated on several
volumes of his photographs with photography critic Nancy Newhall, beginning in
1946.

The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson
houses a full archive of Edward Weston's work.

## [edit] Illness and death

Stricken with Parkinson's Disease, Weston made his last photographs at Point
Lobos State Reserve in 1948. 1952 saw the publication of a 50th-anniversary
portfolio of his work, printed by his son Brett. Brett and Cole Weston, as
well as Brett's wife Dody Warren, were appointed to print 800 of what he
considered his most important negatives under his supervision in the years
1955 to 1956.

Edward Weston died in his house on Wildcat Hill in Carmel Highlands in Big
Sur, California on January 1, 1958, aged 71.[3]

## [edit] Legacy

His comprehensive legacy includes the detailed and articulate Daybooks he kept
regularly from the mid-1920s to 1934, which allow a very intimate glimpse into
his personal life, his views on photography, and his working methods. Weston
is generally recognized as one of the greatest photographic artists of the
20th century.

Most of his photographs are rare and unnumbered and few vintage photographs
are available.

Even though he was a celebrated photographer he survived selling his photos
for a humble price of $7-10. Now, they have gone up over 1,000,000% in value.

## [edit] Quotations

"Photography to the amateur is recreation, to the professional it is work, and
hard work too, no matter how pleasurable it may be."

"The camera should be used for a recording of life, for rendering the very
substance and quintessence of the thing itself, whether it be polished steel
or palpitating flesh."

"I cannot believe I learned anything of value in school unless it be the will
to rebel."

"I want the stark beauty that a lens can so exactly render presented without
interference of artistic effect."
