## [edit] Life and philosophy

Emanuelis Levinas (later adapted to French orthography as Emmanuel Levinas)
received a traditional Jewish education in Lithuania. After WWII, he studied
the Talmud under the enigmatic "Monsieur Chouchani," whose influence he
acknowledged only late in his life.

Levinas began his philosophical studies at Strasbourg University in 1924,
where he began his lifelong friendship with the French philosopher Maurice
Blanchot. In 1928, he went to Freiburg University to study phenomenology under
Edmund Husserl. At Freiburg he also met Martin Heidegger. Levinas became one
of the very first French intellectuals to draw attention to Heidegger and
Husserl, by translating Husserl's Cartesian Meditations and by drawing on
their ideas in his own philosophy, in works such as his The Theory of
Intuition in Husserlâs Phenomenology, De l'Existence Ã l'Existant, and En
DÃ©couvrant lâexistence avec Husserl et Heidegger.

According to his New York Times obituary, Levinas came to regret his
enthusiasm for Heidegger, because of the latter's lack of antipathy for the
Nazis. During a lecture on forgiveness, Levinas stated "One can forgive many
Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is
difficult to forgive Heidegger."[1]

After earning his doctorate Levinas taught at a private Jewish High School in
Paris, the Ãcole Normale IsraÃ©lite Orientale, eventually becoming its
director. He began teaching at the University of Poitiers in 1961, at the
Nanterre campus of the University of Paris in 1967, and at the Sorbonne in
1973, from which he retired in 1979. He was also a Professor at the University
of Fribourg in Switzerland.

In the 1950s, Levinas emerged from the circle of intellectuals surrounding
Jean Wahl as a leading French thinker. His work is based on the ethics of the
Other or, in Levinas' terms, on "ethics as first philosophy." For Levinas, the
Other is not knowable and cannot be made into an object of the self, as is
done by traditional metaphysics (which Levinas called "ontology"). Levinas
prefers to think of philosophy as the "wisdom of love" rather than the love of
wisdom (the literal Greek meaning of the word "philosophy"). By his lights,
ethics becomes an entity independent of subjectivity to the point where
ethical responsibility is integral to the subject; hence an ethics of
responsibility precedes any "objective searching after truth."

Levinas derives the primacy of his ethics from the experience of the encounter
with the Other. For Levinas, the irreducible relation, the epiphany, of the
face-to-face, the encounter with another, is a privileged phenomenon in which
the other person's proximity and distance are both strongly felt. "The Other
precisely reveals himself in his alterity not in a shock negating the I, but
as the primordial phenomenon of gentleness."[2]. At the same time, the
revelation of the face makes a demand, this demand is before one can express,
or know one's freedom, to affirm or deny.[3] One instantly recognizes the
transcendence and heteronomy of the Other. Even murder fails as an attempt to
take hold of this otherness.

In Levinas's later thought following "Totality and Infinity", he argued that
our responsibility for the other was already rooted within our subjective
constitution. It should be noted that the first line of the preface of this
book is "everyone will readily agree that it is of the highest importance to
know whether we are not duped by morality."[4] This can be seen most clearly
in his later account of recurrence (chapter 4 in "Otherwise Than Being"),
where Levinas maintained that subjectivity was formed in and through our
subjected-ness to the other. In this way, his effort was not to move away from
traditional attempts to locate the other within subjectivity (this he agrees
with), so much as his view was that subjectivity was primordially ethical and
not theoretical. That is to say, our responsibility for the other was not a
derivative feature of our subjectivity; instead, obligation founds our
subjective being-in-the-world by giving it a meaningful direction and
orientation. Levinas's thesis "ethics as first philosophy", then, means that
the traditional philosophical pursuit of knowledge is but a secondary feature
of a more basic ethical duty to the other.

The elderly Levinas was a distinguished French public intellectual, whose
books reportedly sold well. He had a major impact on the young Jacques
Derrida, a fellow French Jew whose seminal Writing and Difference contains an
essay, "Violence and Metaphysics," on Levinas. Derrida also delivered a eulogy
at Levinas's funeral, later published as Adieu Ã Emmanuel Levinas, an
appreciation and exploration of Levinas's moral philosophy.

## [edit] War experiences

Levinas became a naturalized French citizen in 1930. When France declared war
on Germany, he was ordered to report for military duty. During the German
invasion of France in 1940, his military unit was quickly surrounded and
forced to surrender. Levinas spent the rest of World War II as a prisoner of
war in a camp near Hannover in Germany. Levinas was assigned to a special
barracks for Jewish prisoners, who were forbidden any forms of religious
worship. Life in the camp was as difficult as might be expected, with Levinas
often forced to chop wood and do other menial tasks. Other prisoners saw him
frequently jotting in a notebook. These jottings became his book De
l'existence Ã l'existant (1947) and a series of lectures published under the
title Le Temps et l'Autre (1948).

Meanwhile, Maurice Blanchot helped Levinas' wife and daughter spend the war in
a monastery, thus sparing them from the Holocaust. Blanchot, at considerable
personal risk, also saw to it that Levinas was able to keep in contact with
his immediate family through letters and other messages. Other members of
Levinas' family were not so fortunate; his mother-in-law was deported and
never heard from again, while his father and brothers were murdered in
Lithuania by the Nazi SS [1].
