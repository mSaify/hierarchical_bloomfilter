Alonzo Church (June 14, 1903 â August 11, 1995) was an American
mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematical logic
and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is best known for the
lambda calculus, Church's thesis and the Church-Rosser theorem.

## [edit] Life

Alonzo Church was born on June 14, 1903 in Washington, DC where his father,
Samuel Robbins Church, was the Justice of the Municipal Court for the District
of Columbia. The family later moved to Virginia after his father lost this
position because of failing eyesight. With help from his uncle, Alonzo Church
was able to attend Ridgefield High School in Connecticut. After graduating
from Ridgefield in 1920, Church attended Princeton University where he was an
exceptional student, publishing his first paper, on Lorentz transformation,
and graduating in 1924 with a degree in mathematics. He stayed on at
Princeton, earning a Ph.D. in mathematics in three years under Oswald Veblen.

He married Mary Julia Kuczinski in 1925 and the couple had three children,
Alonzo Church, Jr. (1929), Mary Ann (1933) and Mildred (1938).

After receiving his Ph.D. he taught briefly as an instructor at the University
of Chicago and then received a two-year National Research Fellowship. This
allowed him to attend Harvard University in 1927â1928 and then both
University of GÃ¶ttingen and University of Amsterdam the following year. He
taught at Princeton, 1929â1967, and at the University of California, Los
Angeles, 1967â1990.

He died in 1995 and was buried in Princeton Cemetery.

## [edit] Mathematical work

Church is best known for the following accomplishments:

  * His proof that Peano arithmetic and first-order logic are undecidable. The latter result is known as Church's theorem.
  * His articulation of what has come to be known as Church's thesis.
  * He was the founding editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, editing its reviews section until 1979.
  * His creation of the lambda calculus.

The lambda calculus emerged in his famous 1936 paper showing the existence of
an "undecidable problem". This result preceded Alan Turing's famous work on
the halting problem which also demonstrated the existence of a problem
unsolvable by mechanical means. He and Turing then showed that the lambda
calculus and the Turing machine used in Turing's halting problem were
equivalent in capabilities, and subsequently demonstrated a variety of
alternative "mechanical processes for computation." This resulted in the
Church-Turing thesis.

The lambda calculus influenced the design of the LISP programming language and
functional programming languages in general. The Church encoding is named in
his honor.

## [edit] Students

Church's doctoral students were an extraordinarily accomplished lot, including
C. Anthony Anderson, Peter Andrews, Martin Davis, Leon Henkin, John George
Kemeny, Stephen Kleene, Gary Mar, Michael O. Rabin, Hartley Rogers, Jr, J.
Barkley Rosser, Dana Scott, Raymond Smullyan, and Alan Turing. See [1]. A more
complete list is at [2] as part of the Mathematics Genealogy Project.
