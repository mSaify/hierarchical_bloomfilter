Nhat Hanh (Vietnamese: Nháº¥t Háº¡nh; pronounced [tÊ°Çk É²ÉÌt hÉÌÊÉ²]
ThichNhatHanh.ogg listen (helpÂ·info) (born October 11, 1926 in central
Vietnam) is an expatriate Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, teacher, author, poet
and peace activist. He joined a Zen monastery at the age of 16, studied
Buddhism as a novice, and was fully ordained as a monk in 1949. Commonly
referred to as Thich Nhat Hanh (Vietnamese: ThÃ­ch Nháº¥t Háº¡nh), the title
ThÃ­ch is used by all Vietnamese monks and nuns, meaning that they are part of
the Shakya (Shakyamuni Buddha) clan.[1]

In the early 1960s, he founded the School of Youth for Social Services (SYSS)
in Saigon, a grassroots relief organization that rebuilt bombed villages, set
up schools and medical centers, and resettled families left homeless during
the Vietnam War.[2] He traveled to the U.S. a number of times to study at
Princeton University, and later to lecture at Cornell University and teach at
Columbia University. His main goal of those travels, however, was to urge the
U.S. government to withdraw from Vietnam. He urged Martin Luther King, Jr., to
oppose the Vietnam War publicly, and spoke with many people and groups about
peace. In a January 25, 1967, letter to the Nobel Institute, King nominated
him for the Nobel Peace Prize.[3] Nhat Hanh led the Buddhist delegation to the
Paris Peace Talks.

One of the best known Buddhist teachers in the West,[4][5] Thich Nhat Hanh's
teachings and practices appeal to people from various religious, spiritual,
and political backgrounds. He offers a practice of mindfulness adapted to
Western sensibilities.[6] He created the Order of Interbeing in 1966, and
established monastic and practice centers around the world. As of 2007 his
home is Plum Village Monastery in the Dordogne region in the South of
France[2] and he travels internationally giving retreats and talks. He coined
the term Engaged Buddhism in his book Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire.[7]

Exiled from Vietnam for many years, he was allowed to return for a trip in
2005[8] and again in 2007.[9] He has published more than 100 books, including
more than 40 in English. He also publishes a quarterly Dharma talk in the
journal of the Order of Interbeing, The Mindfulness Bell. Nhat Hanh continues
to be active in the peace movement, sponsoring retreats for Israelis and
Palestinians, encouraging them to listen and learn about each other. He has
given speeches urging warring countries to stop fighting and look for non-
violent solutions to problems;[10] conducted a peace walk in Los Angeles in
2005, and again in 2007, attended by thousands of people;[11] and urging
support of the demonstrating monks in Myanmar.[12] He was awarded the Courage
of Conscience award June 16, 1991.[13]

## [edit] Biography

<IMG>

<IMG>

Thich Nhat Hanh in Vught, The Netherlands, 2006

Thich Nhat Hanh was born Nguyá» n XuÃ¢n Báº£o in Thá»«a ThiÃªn (Central
Vietnam) in 1926. At the age of 16 he entered the monastery at Tá»« Hiáº¿u
Temple near Huáº¿, Vietnam, where his primary teacher was Dhyana (meditation
Zen) Master Thanh QuÃ½ ChÃ¢n Tháº­t.[1][14][15] A graduate of Bao Quoc
Buddhist Academy in Central Vietnam,[7] Thich Nhat Hanh received training in
Zen (in Vietnamese: Thiá»n) and the Mahayana school of Buddhism and was
ordained as a monk in 1949.

In 1956 he was named editor-in-chief of Vietnamese Buddhism, the periodical of
the Unified Vietnam Buddhist Association (GiÃ¡o Há»i Pháº­t GiÃ¡o Viá»t Nam
Thá»ng Nháº¥t). In the following years he founded LÃ¡ Bá»i Press, the Van
Hanh Buddhist University in Saigon, and the School of Youth for Social Service
(SYSS), a neutral corps of Buddhist peaceworkers who went into rural areas to
establish schools, build healthcare clinics, and help re-build villages.[2]

Thich Nhat Hanh is now recognized as a Dharmacharya and as the spiritual head
of the Tá»« Hiáº¿u Temple and associated monasteries.[16][dead link] He is the
Elder of the Tá»« Hiáº¿u branch of the 8th generation of the Liá» u QuÃ¡n
lineage in the 42nd generation of the LÃ¢m Táº¿ Dhyana school (Lin Chi ChÃ¡n
è¨æ¿ç¦ª in Chinese or Rinzai Zen in Japanese).[1] On May 1, 1966 at Tá»«
Hiáº¿u Temple, Thich Nhat Hanh received the âlamp transmissionâ, making
him a Dharmacharya or Dharma Teacher, from Master ChÃ¢n Tháº­t.[1]

Thich Nhat Hanh has combined his deep knowledge of a variety of traditional
Zen teachings with methods from Theravada Buddhism, insights from Mahayana
Buddhism, and ideas from Western psychology to form his approach to modern
meditation practice. Thich Nhat Hanh has become an important influence in the
development of Western Buddhism.

### [edit] During the Vietnam War

Van Hanh Buddhist University became a prestigious private university that
focused on Buddhist studies, Vietnamese culture, and languages. Nhat Hanh
taught Buddhist psychology and Prajnaparamita literature. At a meeting in
April 1965, Van Hanh Union students issued a Call for Peace statement. Its
main theme was: "It is time for North and South Vietnam to find a way to stop
the war and help all Vietnamese people live peacefully and with mutual
respect." When Thich Nhat Hanh left for the U.S. shortly afterwards, control
over Van Hanh University was taken over by one of the Chancellors who wished
to sever ties with Thich Nhat Hanh and the SYSS, calling Sister Chan Khong,
who was left in control of the organization, a "communist". From that point,
the SYSS struggled to raise funds and endured a number of attacks on its
members, many of whom were threatened, harassed, and murdered. The SYSS
persisted in their efforts, refusing to take sides in the conflict and
continuing to provide aid to people in need.[7]

Thich Nhat Hanh has been a leader in the Engaged Buddhism movement and he is
credited with bringing the idea to the West. He credits the thirteenth-century
Vietnamese King Tran Nhan Tong with the origination of the concept. Tran Nhan
Tong abdicated his throne to become a monk, and founded the still dominant
Vietnamese Buddhist school, the Bamboo Forest tradition.[17]

In 1960, Thich Nhat Hanh came to the U.S. to study comparative religion at
Princeton University, and he was subsequently appointed lecturer in Buddhism
at Columbia University. By then, he had gained fluency in French, Chinese,
Sanskrit, Pali, Japanese, and English, in addition to his native Vietnamese.
In 1963 he returned to Vietnam to aid his fellow monks in their non-violent
peace efforts.

Thich Nhat Hanh returned to the US in 1966 to lead a symposium in Vietnamese
Buddhism at Cornell University and to continue his work for peace. Thich Nhat
Hanh had written a letter to Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1965 entitled:
âSearching for the Enemy of Manâ and it was during his 1966 stay in the
U.S. that Thich Nhat Hanh met with Martin Luther King, Jr. and urged him to
publicly denounce the Vietnam War.[18]

Dr. King gave his famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City in
1967,[19] his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
Later that year, Dr. King nominated Thich Nhat Hanh for the 1967 Nobel Peace
Prize. In his nomination Rev. King said, "I do not personally know of anyone
more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for
peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood,
to humanity." (Despite King's high praise, the committee decided not to make
an award that year. King's revelation of his nomination was a violation of
tradition and the explicit "strong request" of the prize committee.)[3]

In 1969, Thich Nhat Hanh was the delegate for the Buddhist Peace Delegation at
the Paris Peace talks. When the Paris Peace Accords were signed in 1973, the
Vietnamese government denied Thich Nhat Hanh permission to return to Vietnam,
and he went into exile in France. From 1976 through 1977, he led efforts to
help rescue Vietnamese boat people in the Gulf of Siam, but was forced to stop
because of the hostility of the governments of Thailand and Singapore.[20] In
1969, Thich Nhat Hanh established the Unified Buddhist Church (Ãglise
Bouddhique UnifiÃ©e) in France (not a part of the Unified Buddhist Church of
Vietnam).

### [edit] Establishing the Order of Interbeing

<IMG>

<IMG>

Deer Park Monastery in California

In 1975, he formed the Sweet Potatoes Meditation Center. The center grew and
in 1982 he and his colleague Sister ChÃ¢n KhÃ´ng founded Plum Village Buddhist
Center (LÃ ng Mai), a monastery and Practice Center in the Dordogne in the
south of France.[2] Since the mid 60s he has headed a monastic and lay group,
the Order of Inter-Being, teaching the Five and Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings
and "Engaged Buddhism." The Unified Buddhist Church is the legally recognized
governing body for Plum Village (LÃ ng Mai) in France, for Blue Cliff
Monastery in Pine Bush, New York, the Community of Mindful Living, Parallax
Press, Deer Park Monastery in California, and the Magnolia Village in
Mississippi.[21]

There are now two monasteries in Vietnam, at the original Tá»« Hiáº¿u Temple
near Huáº¿ and at Prajna Temple in the central highlands. Thich Nhat Hanh and
the Order of Interbeing have established monasteries and Dharma centers in the
United States at Deer Park Monastery (Tu Viá»n Lá»c Uyá»n) in Escondido,
California, Maple Forest Monastery (Tu Viá»n Rá»«ng Phong) and Green Mountain
Dharma Center (Ãáº¡o TrÃ ng Thanh SÆ¡n) in Vermont both of which closed in
2007 and moved to the Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, New York, and
Magnolia Village Practice Center (Äáº¡o TrÃ ng Má»c Lan) in Mississippi.
These monasteries are open to the public during much of the year and provide
on-going retreats for lay people. The Order of Interbeing also holds focused
retreats for groups of lay people, such as families, teenagers, veterans,[22]
the entertainment industry, members of Congress,[23] law enforcement
officers,[24] people of color,[25][26][dead link][27] and professional and
scientific[28][dead link] interest groups.

Notable students of Thich Nhat Hanh include: Skip Ewing founder of the
Nashville Mindfulness Center, Natalie Goldberg author and teacher, Joan
Halifax founder of the Upaya Institute, Stephanie Kaza environmentalist,
Sister Chan Khong Dharma teacher, Sister Annibell Laity translator of many of
Thich Nhat Hanh's books and director of North American Dharma centers, Noah
Levine author, Albert Low Zen teacher and author, Joanna Macy environmentalist
and author, Caitriona Reed Dharma teacher and co-founder of Manzanita Village
Retreat Center, Leila Seth author and Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court,
and Pritam Singh real estate developer and editor of several of Thich Nhat
Hanh's books.

### [edit] Return to Vietnam

<IMG>

<IMG>

Nhat Hanh during a ceremony in Da Nang on his 2007 trip to Vietnam

From January 12 until April 11, 2005, Thich Nhat Hanh returned to Vietnam
after a series of negotiations that allowed him to teach, have select titles
of his books published in Vietnamese, and allowed 100 monastic and 90 lay
members of his Order to accompany him in his travels around the country,
including a return to his root temple, Tu Hieu Temple in Hue.[8][29]

Prior to the 2005 trip, Thich Nhat Hanhâs organization had been highly
critical of the restrictions imposed by the Vietnamese government regarding a
possible visit. Those restrictions included: not allowing his monastics to
stay in Buddhist monasteries, not allowing him to teach to large crowds as he
does in the West, and not allowing his books to be published in
Vietnamese.[30][dead link]

Nhat Hanh at Huong Son temple on his 2007 trip to Vietnam

The trip was not without controversy. Thich Vien Dinh writing on behalf of the
Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (considered illegal by the Vietnamese
government) called for Thich Nhat Hanh to make a statement against the Vietnam
governmentâs poor record on religious freedom. Thich Vien Dinh feared that
the trip would be used as propaganda by the Vietnamese government, making the
world believe that the issues of religious freedom are improving there, while
abuses continue.[31][32][33]

Nhat Hanh returned to Vietnam in 2007 despite continued controversy over his
return and the continued house arrest of two top officials of the government-
banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.[9] According to the Plum Village
Website, the three goals of his 2007 trip back to Vietnam are to support new
monastics in his Order, organize and conduct "Great Chanting Ceremonies"
intended to help heal remaining wounds from the Vietnam war, and to lead
retreats for monastics and lay people.[34] The chanting ceremonies were
originally called "Grand Requiem for Praying Equally for All to Untie the
Knots of Unjust Suffering," but Vietnamese officials objected, saying it was
improper to "equally" pray for soldiers in the South Vietnamese army or U.S.
soldiers. Nhat Hanh agreed to change the name to "Grand Requiem For
Praying."[9]

## [edit] Names applied to him

The Vietnamese title ThÃ­ch (é) is from "ThÃ­ch Ca" or "ThÃ­ch GiÃ "
(éè¿¦), means "of the Shakya (Shakyamuni Buddha) clan."[1] All Vietnamese
(and Chinese) Buddhist monks and nuns adopt this title as their "family" name
or surname implying that their first family is the Buddhist community. In many
Buddhist traditions, there are a progression of names that a person can
receive. The first, the lineage name, is given when a person takes refuge in
the Three Jewels. Thich Nhat Hanh's lineage name is Trá»«ng Quang. The next is
a Dharma name, given when a person, lay or monastic, takes additional vows or
when one is ordained as a monastic. Thich Nhat Hanh's Dharma name is Phung
Xuan. Additionally, Dharma titles are sometimes given, and Thich Nhat Hanh's
Dharma title is "Nhat Hanh".[1]

Neither Nháº¥t (ä¸) nor Háº¡nh (è¡) â which approximate the roles of
middle or intercalary name and given name, respectively, when referring to him
in English â was part of his name at birth. Nháº¥t (ä¸) means "one",
implying "first-class," or "of best quality," in English; Háº¡nh (è¡) means
"move", implying "right conduct" or "good nature." ThÃ­ch Nháº¥t Háº¡nh has
translated his Dharma Names in the following manner: Nháº¥t = One, and Háº¡nh
= Action. Taken collectively, his Dharma Names are best translated as "One
Action". Vietnamese names follow this naming convention, placing the family or
surname first, then the middle or intercalary name which often refers to the
person's position in the family or generation, followed by the given name.[35]

Thich Nhat Hanh is often referred to as "Thay" (Vietnamese: Tháº§y, "master;
teacher") or Thay Nhat Hanh by his followers. On the Vietnamese version of the
Plum Village website, he is also referred to as Thiá»n SÆ° Nháº¥t Háº¡nh
which can translated as "Zen Priest", "Zen Master", or "Dhyana Master".[36]
Any Vietnamese monk or nun in the Mahayana tradition can be addressed as
"Tháº§y" ("teacher"). Vietnamese Buddhist monks are addressed "Tháº§y tu"
("priest" or "monk") and nuns are addressed "SÆ° CÃ´" ("sister") or "SÆ° BÃ "
("elder sister").
