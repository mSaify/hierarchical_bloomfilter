Marcus Mosiah Garvey, Jr., National Hero of Jamaica (17 August 1887 â 10
June 1940[1]), was a publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, Black Nationalist,
Pan-Africanist, and orator. Marcus Garvey was founder of the Universal Negro
Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL).[2]

Prior to the twentieth century, leaders such as Prince Hall, Martin Delany,
Edward Wilmot Blyden, and Henry Highland Garnet advocated the involvement of
the African diaspora in African affairs. Garvey was unique in advancing a Pan-
African philosophy to inspire a global mass movement focusing on Africa known
as Garveyism.[2] Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of African Redemption,
Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the Nation of Islam,
to the Rastafari movement (which proclaims Garvey as a prophet). The intention
of the movement was for those of African ancestry to "redeem" Africa and for
the European colonial powers to leave it. The idea that African Americans
should return to Africa was known as the Colonist Movement. His essential
ideas about Africa were stated in an editorial in the Negro World entitled
âAfrican Fundamentalismâ where he wrote:

â Our union must know no clime, boundary, or nationalityâ¦ let us hold
together under all climes and in every countryâ¦[3] â

## [edit] Early years

Garvey was born in St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, on August 17, 1887, to Marcus
Mosiah Garvey, Sr., a mason, and Sarah Jane Richards, a domestic worker and
farmer. Of eleven siblings, only Marcus and his sister Indiana reached
maturity.[4] Garvey's father was known to have a large library, and it was
from his father that Marcus gained his love for reading.[2][5] Sometime in the
year 1900, Garvey entered into an apprenticeship with his uncle, Alfred
Burrowes. Like Garvey Sr., Burrowes had an extensive library, of which young
Garvey made good use.[6][7] When he was about fourteen, Garvey left St. Ann's
Bay for Kingston, where he found employment as a compositor in the printing
house of P. A. Benjamin, Limited. He was a master printer and foreman at
Benjamin when, in November 1907, he was elected vice-president of the Kingston
Union. However, he was fired when he joined a strike by printers in late 1908.
Having been blacklisted for his stance in the strike, he later found work at
the Government Printing Office. In 1909, his newspaper The Watchman began
publication, but it only lasted for three issues.

In 1910 Garvey left Jamaica and began traveling throughout the Central
American region. He lived in Costa Rica for several months, where he worked as
a time-keeper on a banana plantation. He began work as editor for a daily
newspaper entitled La Nacionale in 1911. Later that year, he moved to ColÃ³n,
Panama, where he edited a biweekly newspaper before returning to Jamaica in
1912.

After years of working on the Caribbean, Garvey left Jamaica to live in London
from 1912 to 1914, where he attended Birkbeck College, worked for the African
Times and Orient Review, published by DusÃ© Mohamed Ali, and sometimes spoke
at Hyde Park's Speakers' Corner.

## [edit] Founding and Projects of the UNIA-ACL

During his travels, Garvey became convinced that uniting Blacks was the only
way to improve their condition. Towards that end, he departed England on 14
June 1914 aboard the S.S. Trent, reaching Jamaica on 15 July 1914. He founded
the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in August 1914 as a means
of uniting all of Africa and its diaspora into "one grand racial hierarchy."
Amy Ashwood, who would later be Garvey's first wife, was among the founders.
As the group's first President-General, Garvey's goal was "to unite all people
of African ancestry of the world to one great body to establish a country and
absolute government of their own."[8]

Following much reflection the following day and night about what he learned,
he named the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and
African Communities (Imperial) League."[9]

After corresponding with Booker T. Washington, Garvey arrived in the U.S. on
23 March 1916 aboard the S.S. Tallac to give a lecture tour and to raise funds
to establish a school in Jamaica modeled after Washington's Tuskegee
Institute. Garvey visited Tuskegee, and afterward, visited with a number of
Black leaders. After moving to New York, he found work as a printer by day. He
was influenced by Hubert Harrison. At night he would speak on street corners,
much like he did in London's Hyde Park. It was then that Garvey perceived a
leadership vacuum among people of African ancestry. On 9 May 1916, he held his
first public lecture in New York City at St Mark's Church in-the-Bowery and
undertook a 38-state speaking tour.

In May 1917, Garvey and thirteen others formed the first UNIA division outside
Jamaica and began advancing ideas to promote social, political, and economic
freedom for Blacks. On July 2, the East St. Louis riots broke out. On July 8,
Garvey delivered an address, entitled "The Conspiracy of the East St. Louis
Riots," at Lafayette Hall in Harlem. During the speech, he declared the riot
was "one of the bloodiest outrages against mankind." By October, rancor within
the UNIA had begun to set in. A split occurred in the Harlem division, with
Garvey enlisted to become its leader; although he technically held the same
position in Jamaica.

Garvey next set about the business of developing a program to improve the
conditions of those of African ancestry "at home and abroad" under UNIA
auspices. On 17 August 1918, publication of the widely distributed Negro World
newspaper began. Garvey worked as an editor without pay until November 1920.
By June 1919 the membership of the organization had grown to over two million.

On 27 June 1919, the Black Star Line of Delaware, was incorporated by the
members of the UNIA with Garvey as President. By September, it obtained its
first ship. Much fanfare surrounded the inspection of the S.S. Yarmouth and
its rechristening as the S.S. Frederick Douglass on 14 September 1919. Such a
rapid accomplishment garnered attention from many.

One person who noticed was Edwin P. Kilroe, Assistant District Attorney in the
District Attorney's office of the County of New York. Kilroe began an
investigation into the activities of the UNIA, without finding any evidence of
wrongdoing or mismanagement. After being called to Kilroe's office numerous
times, Garvey wrote an editorial on Kilroe's activities for the Negro World.
Garvey was arrested and indicted for criminal libel in relation to the
article, but charges were dismissed after Garvey published a retraction.

While in his Harlem office at 56 West 156th Street on 14 October 1919, Garvey
received a visit from George Tyler, who told him that Kilroe "had sent him" to
get Garvey. Tyler then pulled a .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots,
wounding Garvey in the right leg and scalp. Garvey was taken to the hospital
and Tyler arrested. The next day, it was let out that Tyler had committed
suicide by leaping from the third tier of the Harlem jail as he was being
taken to his arraignment.

By August 1920, the UNIA claimed four million members. That month, the
International Convention of the UNIA was held. With delegates from all over
the world in attendance, over 25,000 people filled Madison Square Garden on
August 1 to hear Garvey speak.

Another of Garvey's ventures was the Negro Factories Corporation. His plan
called for creating the infrastructure to manufacture every marketable
commodity in every big U.S. industrial center, as well as in Central America,
the West Indies, and Africa. Related endeavors included a grocery chain,
restaurant, publishing house, and other businesses.

Convinced that Blacks should have a permanent homeland in Africa, Garvey
sought to develop Liberia.

The Liberia program, launched in 1920, was intended to build colleges,
universities, industrial plants, and railroads as part of an industrial base
from which to operate. However, it was abandoned in the mid-1920s after much
opposition from European powers with interests in Liberia. In response to
suggestions that he wanted to take all Americans of African ancestry back to
Africa, he wrote, "We do not want all the Negroes in Africa. Some are no good
here, and naturally will be no good there."[10]

Garvey has been credited with creating the biggest movement of people of
African descent. This movement that took place in the 1920s is said to have
had more participation from people of African descent than the Civil Rights
Movement. In essence the UNIA was the largest Pan-African movement.

## [edit] Charge of mail fraud

In a memorandum dated 11 October 1919[11], J. Edgar Hoover, special assistant
to the Attorney General, and head of the General Intelligence Division (or
"anti-radical division") [12] of The Bureau of Investigation or BOI (after
1935, the Federal Bureau of Investigation),[13] wrote a memorandum to Special
Agent Ridgely regarding Marcus Garvey. In the memo, Hoover wrote that:

â Unfortunately, however, he [Garvey] has not as yet violated any federal
law whereby he could be proceeded against on the grounds of being an
undesirable alien, from the point of view of deportation.[14][15] â  
Sometime around November 1919 an investigation by the BOI was begun into the
activities of Garvey and the UNIA. Toward this end, the BOI hired James Edward
Amos, Arthur Lowell Brent, Thomas Leon Jefferson, James Wormley Jones, and
Earl E. Titus as its first five African-American agents. Although initial
efforts by the BOI were to find grounds upon which to deport Garvey as "an
undesirable alien", a charge of mail fraud was brought against Garvey in
connection with stock sales of the Black Star Line after the U.S. Post Office
and the Attorney General joined the investigation.[15]

The accusation centered on the fact that the corporation had not yet purchased
a ship with the name "Phyllis Wheatley". Although one was pictured with that
name emblazoned on its bow on one of the company's stock brochures, it had not
actually been purchased by the BSL and still had the name Orion. The
prosecution produced as evidence a single empty envelope which it claimed
contained the brochure. During the trial, a man by the name of Benny Dancy
testified that he didn't remember what was in the envelope, although he
regularly received brochures from the Black Star Line. Another witness for the
prosecution, Schuyler Cargill, perjured himself after admitting[16] to having
been told to mention certain dates in his testimony by Chief Prosecutor
Maxwell S. Mattuck. Furthermore, he admitted that he could not remember the
names of any coworkers in the office, including the timekeeper who punched
employees' time cards. Ultimately, he acknowledged being told to lie by Postal
Inspector F.E. Shea. [17] He said Shea told him to state that he mailed
letters containing the purportedly fraudulent brochures. The Black Star Line
did own and operate several ships over the course of its history and was in
the process of negotiating for the disputed ship at the time the charges were
brought. Assistant District Attorney, Leo H. Healy, who was, before he became
a District Attorney, attorney for Harris McGill and Co., the sellers of the
first ship, the S. S. Yarmouth, to the Black Star Line Inc. was also a key
witness for the government during the trial. [18]

Of the four Black Star Line officers charged in connection with the
enterprise, only Garvey was found guilty of using the mail service to defraud.
His supporters called the trial fraudulent. While there were serious
accounting irregularities within the Black Star Line and the claims he used to
sell Black Star Line stock could be considered misleading, Garvey's supporters
still contest that the prosecution was a politically motivated miscarriage of
justice, given the above-mentioned false statement testimony and Hoover's
explicit regret that Garvey had committed no crimes.

When the trial ended on 23 June 1923, Garvey had been sentenced to five years
in prison. He initially spent three months in the Tombs Jail awaiting approval
of bail. While on bail, he continued to maintain his innocence, travel, speak
and organize the UNIA. After numerous attempts at appeal were unsuccessful, he
was taken into custody and began serving his sentence at the Atlanta Federal
Penitentiary on 8 February 1925.[19] Two days later, he penned his well known
"First Message to the Negroes of the World From Atlanta Prison" wherein he
makes his famous proclamation:

â Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you,
for, with God's grace, I shall come and bring with me countless millions of
black slaves who have died in America and the West Indies and the millions in
Africa to aid you in the fight for Liberty, Freedom and Life.[20] â  
Professor Judith Stein has stated, âhis politics were on trial.â[21]

Garvey's sentence was eventually commuted by President Calvin Coolidge. Upon
his release in November 1927, Garvey was deported via New Orleans to Jamaica,
where a large crowd met him at Orrett's Wharf in Kingston. A huge procession
and band converged on UNIA headquarters.

## [edit] Criticism

While W. E. B. Du Bois expressed the Black Star Line was âoriginal and
promising,â[22] he also said: âMarcus Garvey is, without doubt, the most
dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and in the world. He is either a
lunatic or a traitor.â[23] Du Bois feared that Garvey's activities would
undermine his efforts toward black rights.

Garvey suspected Du Bois was prejudiced against him because he was a Caribbean
native with darker skin. Du Bois once described Marcus Garvey as "a little fat
black man, ugly, but with intelligent eyes and a big head."[citation needed]
Garvey called Du Bois âpurely and simply a white man's nigger" and "a little
Dutch, a little French, a little Negro â¦ a mulatto â¦ a monstrosity.â
This led to an acrimonious relationship between Garvey and the NAACP.[24]
Garvey accused Du Bois of paying conspirators to sabotage the Black Star Line
to destroy his reputation.[25]

Garvey recognized the influence of the Ku Klux Klan, and in early 1922, he
went to Atlanta, Georgia for a conference with KKK imperial giant Edward Young
Clarke.

According to Garvey, âI regard the Klan, the Anglo-Saxon clubs and White
American societies, as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the
race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together. I like honesty
and fair play. You may call me a Klansman if you will, but, potentially, every
white man is a Klansman, as far as the Negro in competition with whites
socially, economically and politically is concerned, and there is no use
lying.â[26] Leo H. Healy publicly accused Garvey of being a member of the Ku
Klux Klan in his testimony during the mail fraud trial. [27]

After Garvey's entente with the Ku Klux Klan, a number of African American
leaders appealed to U.S. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty to have Garvey
incarcerated.[28]

## [edit] Later years

In 1928, Garvey travelled to Geneva to present the Petition of the Negro Race.
This petition outlined the worldwide abuse of Africans to the League of
Nations. In September 1929, he founded the People's Political Party (PPP),
Jamaica's first modern political party, which focused on workers' rights,
education, and aid to the poor.

Also in 1929, Garvey was elected councilor for the Allman Town Division of the
Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). However, he lost his seat because
of having to serve a prison sentence for contempt of court. But, in 1930,
Garvey was re-elected, unopposed, along with two other PPP candidates.

In April 1931, Garvey launched the Edelweiss Amusement Company. He set the
company up to help artists earn their livelihood from their craft. Several
Jamaican entertainers â Kidd Harold, Ernest Cupidon, Bim & Bam, and Ranny
Williams â went on to become popular after receiving initial exposure that
the company gave them.

In 1935, Garvey left Jamaica for London. He lived and worked in London until
his death in 1940. During these last five years, Garvey remained active and in
touch with events in war-torn Ethiopia (then known as Abyssinia) and in the
West Indies. In 1937, he wrote the poem Ras Nasibu Of Ogaden[29] in honor of
Ethiopian Army Commander (Ras) Nasibu Emmanual. In 1938, he gave evidence
before the West Indian Royal Commission on conditions there. Also in 1938 he
set up the School of African Philosophy in Toronto to train UNIA leaders. He
continued to work on the magazine The Black Man.

In 1937, a group of Garvey's American supporters called the Peace Movement of
Ethiopia openly collaborated with Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo in the
promotion of a repatriation scheme introduced in the US Congress as the
Greater Liberia Act. In the Senate, Bilbo was a supporter of Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal. Bilbo was an outspoken supporter of segregation and
white supremacy and, attracted by the ideas of Black separatists like Garvey,
Bilbo proposed an amendment to the federal work-relief bill on June 6, 1938,
proposing to deport 12 million black Americans to Liberia at federal expense
to relieve unemployment.[30] He took the time to write a book titled Take Your
Choice, Separation or Mongrelization, advocating the idea. Garvey praised him
in return, saying that Bilbo had "done wonderfully well for the Negro".[31]

During this period, the grandmother of the current (55th) Governor of New
York, David Paterson served as his secretary.

## [edit] Death

See also: List of premature obituaries

On June 10, 1940, Garvey died after two strokes, putatively after reading a
mistaken, and negative, obituary of himself in the Chicago Defender which
stated, in part, that Garvey died "broke, alone and unpopular".[32] Because of
travel conditions during World War II, he was interred at Kensal Green
Cemetery in London. Rumours claimed that Garvey was in fact poisoned on a boat
on which he was travelling and that was where and how he actually died.

In 1964, his remains were exhumed and taken to Jamaica. On 15 November 1964,
the government of Jamaica, having proclaimed him Jamaica's first national
hero, re-interred him at a shrine in National Heroes Park.

## [edit] Personal life

Marcus Garvey was married twice: to the Jamaican Pan-African activist Amy
Ashwood (married 1919, divorced 1922), who worked with him in the early years
of UNIA; then to the journalist and publisher Amy Jacques (married 1922). The
latter was mother to his two sons, Marcus Jr. and Julius.

## [edit] Influence

The UNIA flag uses three colors: red, black and green.

Garvey's memory has been kept alive.[33] Schools, colleges, highways, and
buildings in Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and the United States have been
named in his honor. The UNIA red, black, and green flag has been adopted as
the Black Liberation Flag. Since 1980, Garvey's bust has been housed in the
Organization of American States' Hall of Heroes in Washington, D.C.

Malcolm X's parents, Earl and Louise Little, met at a UNIA convention in
Montreal. Earl was the president of the UNIA division in Omaha, Nebraska and
sold the Negro World newspaper while Louise was a contributor to the Negro
World.

Kwame Nkrumah named the national shipping line of Ghana the Black Star Line in
honor of Garvey and the UNIA. Nkrumah also named the national soccer team the
Black Stars as well. The black star at the center of Ghana's flag is also
inspired by the Black Star Line.

During a trip to Jamaica, Martin Luther King and his wife Coretta Scott King
visited the shrine of Marcus Garvey on 20 June 1965 and laid a wreath.[34] In
a speech he told the audience that Garvey "was the first man of color to lead
and develop a mass movement. He was the first man on a mass scale and level to
give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny. And make the Negro
feel he was somebody."[35]

King was also the posthumous recipient of the first Marcus Garvey Prize for
Human Rights on 10 December 1968 issued by the Jamaican Government and
presented to King's widow.

The United States of Africa first saw light in a 1924 poem by Garvey and is
still discussed.

There have been pop culture references to Marcus Garvey since he first came on
the international scene. Garvey is cited repeatedly in a diverse variety of
books, songs and films. He is mentioned particularly frequently in blues,
reggae, jazz and hip hop music.

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Marcus Garvey on his list of 100
Greatest African Americans.[36]

### [edit] Rastafari and Garvey

Rastafarians consider Garvey a religious prophet, and sometimes even the
reincarnation of Saint John the Baptist. This is partly because of his
frequent statements uttered in speeches throughout the 1920s, usually along
the lines of "Look to Africa, when a black king shall be crowned for the day
of deliverance is at hand!"[37]

His beliefs deeply influenced the Rastafari, who took his statements as a
prophecy of the crowning of Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. Early Rastas were
associated with his Back-to-Africa movement in Jamaica. This early Rastafari
movement was also influenced by a separate, proto-Rasta movement known as the
Afro-Athlican Church that was outlined in a religious text known as the Holy
Piby â where Garvey was proclaimed to be a prophet as well. Thus, the
Rastafari movement can be seen as an offshoot of Garveyite philosophy. As his
beliefs have greatly influenced Rastafari, he is often mentioned in reggae
music.

Garvey himself never identified with the Rastafari movement, and was, in fact,
raised as a Methodist who went on to become a Catholic.
