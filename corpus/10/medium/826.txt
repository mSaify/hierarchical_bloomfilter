1688) was a Welsh privateer, who made a name in the Caribbean as a leader of
privateers. He was one of the most notorious and successful privateers from
Wales, and one of the most dangerous pirates that lurked in the Spanish Main.

## [edit] Early life

Henry Morgan was supposedly the oldest son of Robert Morgan, a squire of
Llanrumney in the Welsh county of Monmouthshire. However, it has also been
postulated that he was from Abergavenny within the same county of Wales, there
being a record of an entry in the 'Bristol Apprentice Books' showing 'Servants
to Foreign Plantations' : February 9th 1655; 'Henry Morgan of Abergavenny,
Labourer, Bound to Timothy Tounsend of Bristol, Cutler, for three years, to
serve in Barbadoras on the like Condiciouns' ; there is no record of Morgan
himself before 1665. He said later that he left school early, and was "more
used to the pike than the book." Exquemelin says that he indentured in
Barbados but he was forced to retract his claim and subsequent editions were
amended after Morgan sued the publishers for libel and was awarded Â£200
against the publishers [1]; Richard Browne, his surgeon at Panama, said that
Morgan came to Jamaica in 1658, as a young man, and raised himself to "fame
and fortune by his valour".[2] Jamaica had been conquered by the English
Commonwealth in May 1655.

His uncle Edward Morgan was Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica after the
Restoration of Charles II of England in 1660, and Henry Morgan married his
uncle's daughter Mary. Therefore it is more likely that he was the "Captain
Morgan" who joined the fleet of Christopher Myngs in 1663 and accompanied the
expedition of John Morris and Jackman when the Spanish settlements at Vildemos
(on the Tabasco river), Trujillo, (Honduras) and Granada (in Coahuila, Mexico)
were taken.[who?][citation needed]

In late 1665, Morgan commanded a ship in the old privateer Edward
Mansfield's[3] expedition sent by Sir Thomas Modyford, the governor of
Jamaica, which seized the islands of Providence and Santa Catalina. When
Mansfield was captured and killed by the Spanish shortly afterwards, Morgan
was chosen by the privateers as their admiral.

## [edit] Governor's commission, privateering career

In 1667, he was commissioned by Modyford to capture some Spanish prisoners in
Cuba in order to discover details of the threatened attack on Jamaica.
Collecting 10 ships with 500 men, Morgan landed on the island and captured and
sacked Puerto Principe (Spanish name for Port-au-Prince Haiti), then went on
to take the fortified and well-garrisoned town of Portobelo, Panama.

The governor of Panama, astonished at this daring adventure, attempted in vain
to drive out the invaders, and finally Morgan consented to evacuate the place
on the payment of a large ransom. These exploits had considerably exceeded the
terms of Morgan's commission and had been accompanied by frightful cruelties
and excesses, but the governor of Jamaica endeavoured to cover the whole under
the necessity of allowing the English a free hand to attack the Spanish
whenever possible. In London the Admiralty publicly claimed ignorance about
this, whilst Morgan and his crew returned to their base at Port Royal,
Jamaica, to celebrate.

Modyford almost immediately entrusted Morgan with another expedition against
the Spaniards, and he proceeded to ravage the coast of Cuba. Soon after,
England sent Port Royal HMS Oxford (as a gift meant to protect Port Royal);
Port Royal gave it to Morgan to help his career. On January 1669, HMS Oxford
was blown up accidentally when the ammunitions depot was lit during a party,
with Morgan and his officers narrowly escaping death. In March he sacked
Maracaibo, Venezuela which had emptied out when his fleet was first spied, and
afterwards spent a few weeks at the Venezuelan settlement of Gibraltar on Lake
Maracaibo, torturing the wealthy residents to discover hidden treasure.

Returning to Maracaibo, Morgan found three Spanish ships, the Magdalena, the
San Luis, and the Soledad, waiting at the inlet to the Caribbean; he destroyed
the Magdalena, and captured the Soledad, while the San Luis's crew burned down
their ship to stop the pirates from having it.[citation needed] Finally, by an
ingenious stratagem, he faked a landward attack on the fort which convinced
the governor to shift his cannon. In doing so, he eluded the enemy's guns
altogether and escaped in safety. On his return to Jamaica he was again
reproved, but not punished by Modyford.

The Spaniards for their part started to react and threaten Jamaica. A new
commission was given to Morgan as commander-in-chief of all the ships of war
in Jamaica, to levy war on the Spaniards and destroy their ships and stores -
the booty gained in the expedition being the only pay. Thus Morgan and his
crew were on this occasion privateers, not pirates. After ravaging the coasts
of Cuba and the mainland, Morgan determined on an expedition to Panama.

He recaptured the island of Santa Catalina on December 15, 1670, and, on
December 27, he gained possession of the fortress of San Lorenzo in the
Caribbean coast of Panama, killing 300 men of the garrison and leaving 23
alive. Then with 1,400 men he ascended the Chagres River towards the Pacific
coast and Panama City.

## [edit] Burning of Panama and loss of English support

On January 18, 1671, Morgan discovered that Panama had roughly 1,500 infantry
and cavalry. He split his forces in two, using one to march through the forest
and flank the enemy. The Spaniards were untrained and rushed Morgan's line
where he cut them down with gunfire, only to have his flankers emerge and
finish off the rest of the Spanish soldiers. Although Panama was at the time
the richest city in New Spain, Morgan and his men obtained far less plunder
than they had expected. Much of the city's wealth had been removed onto a
Spanish ship that then stood out into the Gulf of Panama, beyond the looters'
reach.[4] Most of the inhabitants' remaining goods were destroyed in a fire of
unclear cause. Morgan's men tortured those residents of Panama they could
catch, but very little gold was forthcoming from the victims. After Morgan's
attack, the Panama city had to be rebuilt in a new site a few kilometres to
the west (the current site). The former site is called PanamÃ¡ Viejo and still
contains the remaining parts of the old Panama City.

Because the sack of Panama violated a peace treaty between England and Spain,
Morgan was arrested and conducted to the Kingdom of England in 1672. He proved
he had no knowledge of the treaty. Instead of punishment, Morgan was knighted
in 1674 before returning to Jamaica the following year to take up the post of
Lieutenant Governor.[citation needed]

By 1681, then-acting governor Morgan had fallen out of favour with the English
king, who was intent on weakening the semi-autonomous Jamaican Council, and
was replaced by long-time political rival Thomas Lynch. He gained considerable
weight and a reputation for rowdy drunkenness.

## [edit] Retirement

In 1683, Morgan was suspended from the Jamaican Council by the machinations of
Governor Lynch. Also during this time, an account of Morgan's disreputable
exploits was published by Alexandre Exquemelin, who once had been his
confidante, probably as a barber-surgeon, in a Dutch volume entitled De
Americaensche Zee-Roovers (History of the Buccaneers of America). Morgan took
steps to discredit the book and successfully brought a libel suit against the
book's publisher, securing a retraction and damages of two hundred English
pounds (Campbell, 2003). The book nonetheless contributed much to Morgan's
reputed fame as a bloodthirsty pirate over time.

When Thomas Lynch died in 1684, his friend Christopher Monck was appointed to
the governorship and arranged the dismissal of Morgan's suspension from the
Jamaican Council in 1688. Morgan's health had steadily declined since 1681. He
was diagnosed with "dropsie", but may have contracted tuberculosis in London,
and died August 25, 1688. It is also possible that he may have had liver
failure due to his heavy drinking. He is buried in Palisadoes cemetery, which
sank beneath the sea after the 1692 earthquake. [1]

Morgan had lived in an opportune time for pirates. He was successfully able to
use the conflicts between England and her enemies both to support England and
to enrich himself and his crews. With his death, the pirates who would follow
would also use this same ploy, but with less successful results. He was also
one of the few pirates who were able to retire from his piracy, having had
great success, and with little legal retribution.

## [edit] Appearances in popular culture

  * In 2006, The History Channel premiered the documentary True Caribbean Pirates, which retells the known facts of Henry Morgan's life and death through re-enactments. The Morgan segment takes place in the first half hour of this two hour special that highlights the true exploits of the most famous pirates from the golden age of piracy. Morgan is portrayed by Lance J. Holt.
  * The 1961 film Morgan the Pirate, starring Steve Reeves, gives the account of how he became a pirate and was then courted by the British to work for them.

tattermedallions / Scum and scourge of the hemisphere, / Who looted the loot
of the stately galleons, / Led by Morgan, the Buccaneer.
