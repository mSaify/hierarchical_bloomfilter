## [edit] Biography

According to the 1930 U.S. Census, Mandino was named after his paternal
grandfather.

Mandino was once the editor of a high school paper and planned to attend the
University of Missouri's journalism school. But in the summer of 1940, before
Mandino was able to enter college, his mother died suddenly from a massive
heart attack. This happened while Mandino's mother was in the kitchen
preparing his lunch. After the incident, Mandino decided to work in a paper
factory until 1942. Afterwards, Mandino joined the United States Army Air
Corps where he became a military officer and a bombardier. He flew for thirty
bombing missions over Germany on board a B-24 Liberator during World War
II.[1] It was also during this time that Mandino flew with fellow pilot and
movie star, James Stewart. Mandino kept a personalized 8 X 10 photograph of
Stewart. This photograph hung on the wall of his home office where he wrote
his books.

After his military duties, Mandino discovered that many companies were not
hiring many former bomber pilots. As a result, he became an insurance
salesman. Traveling on the road and sitting in bars at night, Mandino became
an alcoholic. He was unable to keep a job. As a result, Mandino's wife,
together with their only child, left him. One wintry November morning in
Cleveland, Mandino almost tried to commit suicide. But as he sorted through
several books in a library, volumes of self-help, success and motivation books
captured Mandino's attention. He selected some titles, went to a table and
began reading. Mandino followed his visit to the library with more visits to
many other libraries around the United States. He read hundreds of books that
dealt with success, a pastime that help him alleviate his alcoholism. It was
in a library in Concord, New Hampshire, where he found W. Clement Stone's
classic, Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, a book that changed
Mandino for the better.

Mandino eventually became a successful writer. His works were inspired by the
Bible and influenced by Napoleon Hill, W. Clement Stone, and Emmet Fox.

## [edit] Philosophy

Mandino wrote The Greatest Salesman in the World which contains the time-
tested wisdom of the ancients distilled into ten simple scrolls which, if
followed for the prescribed ten months, will as Og says, "will seep into my
other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my
dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend. As the words of
these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each
morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my
enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I
once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible
to be in this world of strife and sorrow." (Scroll I)

The scrolls each have a principle designed to replace bad habits built up over
a lifetime which "threatens to imprison my future" (Scroll I) with good habits
developed through a ten month process of studying the scrolls. Each Scroll's
principle is life altering. They are:

  * Scroll I - Today I begin a new life.
  * Scroll II - I will greet this day with love in my heart.
  * Scroll III - I will persist until I succeed.
  * Scroll IV - I am nature's greatest miracle.
  * Scroll V - I will live this day as if it is my last.
  * Scroll VI - Today I will be master of my emotions.
  * Scroll VII - I will laugh at the world (Keep perspective)
  * Scroll VIII - Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.
  * Scroll IX - I will act now, I will act now, I will act now.
  * Scroll X - I will pray for guidance.

Mandino's main philosophical message is that every person on earth is a
miracle and should choose to direct their life with confidence and congruent
to the laws that govern abundance. He wrote in Scroll I, "I will not fail as
the others, for in my hands I now hold the charts (the Ten Scrolls) which will
guide me through perilous waters to shores which only yesterday seemed but a
dream." Og was also a proponent of taking action now. In Scroll IX, the phrase
I will act now is written 18 times. He recognized that all successful people
take on their own lives by "charting" or consciously choosing both the desired
destination and the path to reach it. Although Mandino's philosophical
messages have Christian undertones, they are actually encouragements to build
good habits, to live according to the laws that govern abundance and to find a
vigor and joy in life as we learn to stand at the helm of our ship charting
its course into the safety of the harbor instead of just waiting for someone
else to bring it in.

## [edit] Profile

Mandino was married to his second wife Bette on December 9, 1957. He wrote a
total of 19 books, 16 of which are still in print, the first being The
Greatest Salesman in the World. He retired at the age of 52. Mandino was six
feet tall with brown eyes and brown hair. He liked pasta in marinara sauce and
spicy and hot foods. His wife, Bette, used to carry a jar of red pepper at all
times inside her purse for Mandino. Because Mandino's favorite color was
green, he therefore always tried to autograph his books in green ink, which is
surprising, considering he was colorblind. He liked to travel to Bermuda.

Mandino's hometown was Natick, Massachusetts. He was the oldest of three
children. He had a younger brother named Silvio and a sister named
Jacquintine.

Mandino was a golf enthusiast, and also loved track-and-field events. He
usually read when not writing. He adored his family, and liked playing
baseball and reading for his children. Every weekend, Mandino and his family
had automobile races in the basement of their home.

Because Mandino was color-blind, it was necessary for his wife, Bette, to
write down the color of each pair of pants on the zipper area and mark his
ties with numbers, before leaving for any speaking engagements and book tours.
Bette also had to put a stack of cards inside Mandino's suitcase to help him
identify which pair of pants would match with his ties.

According to his wife, Niceleta, Mandino was an avid reader of books.[2]. His
favorite author was Henry David Thoreau. And he also enjoyed reading science
fiction, historical and religious books, and letters written by authors.
