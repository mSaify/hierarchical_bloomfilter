## [edit] Early life

Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan on 8 November, 1954, the son of Shigeo
Ishiguro, an oceanographer, and his wife Shizuko.[2] In 1960 his family,
including his two sisters, moved to Guildford, Surrey so that his father could
work on oil development in the North Sea.[2] He attended Stoughton Primary
School and then Woking County Grammar School in Surrey.[2] After finishing
school he took a 'gap year' and travelled through America and Canada, whilst
writing a journal and sending demo tapes to record companies.[2]

In 1974 he began studies at the University of Kent, Canterbury, and he
graduated in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts (honours) in English and
Philosophy.[2] After spending a year writing fiction, he resumed his studies
at the University of East Anglia where he gained a Master of Arts in Creative
Writing.[2]

## [edit] Literary characteristics

A number of his novels are set in the past. His most recent, Never Let Me Go,
had science fiction qualities and a futuristic tone; however, the given time
period is the late 1990s, and thus takes place in an alternate, though very
similar, world. His fourth novel, The Unconsoled, takes place in an unnamed
Central European city. The Remains of the Day is set in the large country
house of an English lord, in the period leading up to, and the period after,
the Second World War.

An Artist of the Floating World is set in Ishiguro's home town of Nagasaki
during the period of reconstruction following the detonation of the atomic
bomb there in 1945. The narrator is forced to come to terms with his part in
the Second World War. He finds himself blamed by the new generation who accuse
him of being part of Japan's misguided foreign policy, and is forced to
confront the ideals of the modern times as represented in his grandson.

The novels are written in the first-person narrative style and the narrators
often exhibit human failings. Ishiguro's technique is to allow these
characters to reveal their flaws implicitly during the narrative. The author
thus creates a sense of pathos by allowing the reader to see the narrator's
flaws while being drawn into sympathy with him. That pathos is often derived
from the narrator's actions, or, more often, inaction. In The Remains of the
Day, the butler Stevens fails to act on his romantic feelings toward the
housekeeper Miss Kenton because he fails to reconcile his sense of service and
his personal life.

The novels end without a sense of resolution. The issues his characters
confront are buried in the past, and those issues remain unresolved. Thus
Ishiguro ends many of his novels on a note of melancholic resignation, whereby
his characters accept their past and who they have become, and find comfort in
that realization by a relief from mental anguish. This can be seen as a
literary reflection on the Japanese idea of mono no aware.

### [edit] Ishiguro and Japan

Although Ishiguro was born in Japan, has a Japanese name, and set his first
two novels in Japan, in several interviews he has had to clarify to the
reading audience that he has little familiarity with Japanese writing and that
his works bear little resemblance to Japanese fiction. In a 1990 interview he
said, "If I wrote under a pseudonym and got somebody else to pose for my
jacket photographs, I'm sure nobody would think of saying, 'This guy reminds
me of that Japanese writer.'"[3] Although some Japanese writers have had a
distant influence on his writing â Jun'ichirÅ Tanizaki is the one he most
frequently names â Ishiguro has said that Japanese films, especially those
of YasujirÅ Ozu and Mikio Naruse, have been a more significant influence.[4]

Ishiguro left Japan in 1960 at the age of 5 and did not return until 1989,
nearly 30 years later, as a participant in the Japan Foundation Short-Term
Visitors Program. In an interview with Kenzaburo Oe, Ishiguro acknowledged
that the Japanese setting of his first two novels was "imaginary": "I grew up
with a very strong image in my head of this other country, a very important
other country to which I had a strong emotional tie... in England I was all
the time building up this picture in my head, an imaginary Japan."[5]

## [edit] Literary Prizes

He was featured in the first two Granta Best of Young British Novelists:
1983[6] and 1993[7]. He won the Whitbread Prize in 1986 for his second novel,
An Artist of the Floating World. He won the Booker Prize in 1989 for his third
novel, The Remains of the Day. An Artist of the Floating World, When We Were
Orphans and his most recent book, Never Let Me Go, were all short-listed for
the Booker Prize, with the latter being named the runner-up. In 1998, he was
awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture.
On Time magazine's 2005 list of the 100 greatest English language books since
the magazine formed in 1923, Never Let Me Go was the most recently published
book on the list.
