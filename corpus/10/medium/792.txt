## [edit] Biography

Fela was born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti in Abeokuta, Ogun State,
Nigeria,[2] to a middle-class family. His mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, the
first Nigerian female to drive a car, was a feminist activist in the anti-
colonial movement and his father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, a
Protestant minister and school principal, was the first president of the
Nigerian Union of Teachers. His brothers, Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye
Ransome-Kuti both medical doctors, are well known in Nigeria.

Fela was sent to London in 1958 to study medicine but decided to study music
instead at the Trinity College of Music. While there he formed the band Koola
Lobitos, playing a style of music that he would later call afrobeat. The style
was a fusion of African jazz and funk with West African highlife. In 1961,
Fela married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he would have
three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola). In 1963, Fela moved back to Nigeria,
re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian
Broadcasting Corporation. In 1969, Fela took the band to the United States.
While there, Fela discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith
(now Isidore)âa partisan of the Black Panther Partyâwhich would heavily
influence his music and political views and renamed the band Nigeria â70.
Soon, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter
that Fela and his band were in the US without work permits. The band then
performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be
released as The â69 Los Angeles Sessions.

Fela and his band, renamed Africa '70, returned to Nigeria. He then formed the
Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio, and a home for many
connected to the band that he later declared independent from the Nigerian
state. Fela set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, named the Afro-Spot and
then the Afrika Shrine, where he performed regularly. Fela also changed his
middle name to Anikulapo (meaning "he who carries death in his pouch"),[3]
stating that his original middle name of Ransome was a slave name. The
recordings continued, and the music became more politically motivated. Fela's
music became very popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in general.
In fact, he made the decision to sing in Pidgin English so that his music
could be enjoyed by individuals all over Africa, where the local languages
spoken are very diverse and numerous. As popular as Fela's music had become in
Nigeria and elsewhere, it was also very unpopular with the ruling government,
and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. During 1972 Ginger Baker
recorded Stratavarious with Fela appearing alongside Bobby Gass.[4] In 1974
the police arrived with a search warrant and a cannabis joint, which they had
intended to plant on Fela. He became wise to this and swallowed the joint. In
response, the police took him into custody and waited to examine his feces.
Fela enlisted the help of his prison mates and gave the police someone else's
feces, and Fela was freed. He then recounted this tale in his release
Expensive Shit.

In 1977 Fela and the Afrika â70 released the hit album Zombie, a scathing
attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods
of the Nigerian military. The album was a smash hit with the people and
infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta
Republic, during which one thousand soldiers attacked the commune. Fela was
severely beaten, and his elderly mother was thrown from a window, causing
fatal injuries. The Kalakuta Republic was burned, and Fela's studio,
instruments, and master tapes were destroyed. Fela claimed that he would have
been killed if it were not for the intervention of a commanding officer as he
was being beaten. Fela's response to the attack was to deliver his mother's
coffin to the main army barrack in Lagos and write two songs, "Coffin for Head
of State" and "Unknown Soldier," referencing the official inquiry that claimed
the commune had been destroyed by an unknown soldier.

Fela and his band then took residence in Crossroads Hotel as the Shrine had
been destroyed along with his commune. In 1978 Fela married 27 women, many of
whom were his dancers, composers, and singers to mark the anniversary of the
attack on the Kalakuta Republic. Later, he was to adopt a rotation system of
keeping only twelve simultaneous wives.[5] The year was also marked by two
notorious concerts, the first in Accra in which riots broke out during the
song "Zombie," which led to Fela being banned from entering Ghana. The second
was at the Berlin Jazz Festival after which most of Fela's musicians deserted
him, due to rumors that Fela was planning to use the entirety of the proceeds
to fund his presidential campaign.

Despite the massive setbacks, Fela was determined to come back. He formed his
own political party, which he called Movement of the People. In 1979 he put
himself forward for President in Nigeria's first elections for more than a
decade but his candidature was refused. At this time, Fela created a new band
called Egypt 80 and continued to record albums and tour the country. He
further infuriated the political establishment by dropping the names of ITT
vice-president Moshood Abiola and then General Olusegun Obasanjo at the end of
a hot-selling 25-minute political screed titled "I.T.T. (International Thief-
Thief)."

In 1984, he was again attacked by the Military government, who jailed him on a
dubious charge of currency smuggling. His case was taken up by several human-
rights groups, and after 20 months, he was released from prison by General
Ibrahim Babangida. On his release he divorced his 12 remaining wives, saying
that "marriage brings jealousy and selfishness."[5] Once again, Fela continued
to release albums with Egypt 80, made a number of successful tours of the
United States and Europe and also continued to be politically active. In 1986,
Fela performed in Giants Stadium in New Jersey as part of the Amnesty
International Conspiracy of Hope concert, sharing the bill with Bono, Carlos
Santana, and the Neville Brothers. In 1989, Fela & Egypt 80 released the anti-
apartheid "Beasts of No Nation" album that depicts on its cover U.S. President
Ronald Reagan, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and South African Prime
Minister P.W. Botha with fangs dripping blood.

His album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually he stopped releasing
albums altogether. The battle against military corruption in Nigeria was
taking its toll, especially during the rise of dictator Sani Abacha. Rumors
were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was
refusing treatment. On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a
prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, stunned the nation by
announcing his younger brother's death a day earlier from Kaposi's sarcoma
brought on by AIDS. (Their younger brother Beko was in jail at this time at
the hand of Abacha for political activity). More than a million people
attended Fela's funeral at the site of the old Shrine compound. A new Africa
Shrine has opened since Fela's death in a different section of Lagos under the
supervision of his son Femi Kuti.

## [edit] Music

The musical style performed by Fela Kuti is called Afrobeat, which is
essentially a fusion of jazz, funk, psychedelic rock, and traditional West
African chants and rhythms. It is characterized by having African-style
percussion, vocals, and musical structure, along with jazzy, funky horn
sections. The endless groove is also used, in which a base rhythm of drums,
shekere, muted guitar, and bass guitar are repeated throughout the song. His
band was notable for featuring two baritone saxophones, whereas most groups
using this instrument only use one. This is a common technique in African and
African-influenced musical styles, and can be seen in funk and hip-hop. Some
elements often present in Fela's music are the call-and-response within the
chorus and figurative but simple lyrics. Fela's songs were almost always over
10 minutes in length, some reaching the 20- or even 30-minute marks, while
some unreleased tracks would last up to 45 minutes when performed live. This
was one of many reasons that his music never reached a substantial degree of
popularity outside of Africa. His songs were mostly sung in Nigerian pidgin,
although he also performed a few songs in the Yoruba language. Fela's main
instruments were the saxophone and the keyboards, but he also played the
trumpet, guitar, and took the occasional drum solo. Fela refused to perform
songs again after he had already recorded them, which also hindered his
popularity outside Africa. Fela was known for his showmanship, and his
concerts were often quite outlandish and wild. He referred to his stage act as
the Underground Spiritual Game. Fela attempted making a movie but lost all the
materials to the fire that was set to his house by the military government in
power.

## [edit] Political views

The American Black Power movement influenced Fela's political views. He was
also a supporter of Pan-Africanism and socialism, and called for a united,
democratic African republic. He was a fierce supporter of human rights, and
many of his songs are direct attacks against dictatorships, specifically the
militaristic governments of Nigeria in the 1970s and 1980s. He was also a
social commentator, and he criticized his fellow Africans (especially the
upper class) for betraying traditional African culture. The African culture he
believed in also included having many wives (polygyny) and the Kalakuta
Republic was formed in part as a polygamist colony. He defended his stance on
polygyny with the words "A man goes for many women in the first place. Like in
Europe, when a man is married, when the wife is sleeping, he goes out and
fucks around. He should bring the women in the house, man, to live with him,
and stop running around the streets!"[6] His views towards women are
characterised by some as misogynist, with songs like "Mattress" typically
cited as evidence[7] In a more complex example, he mocks the aspiration of
African women to European standards of ladyhood while extolling the values of
the market woman in his song "Lady." It should be noted, though, that Fela was
very open when it came to sex, as he portrayed in some of his songs, such as
"Open and Close" and "Na Poi."

### [edit] Chief Priest Say

Bypassing editorial censorship in Nigeria's predominantly state controlled
press, Kuti began in the 1970s buying advertising space in daily and weekly
newspapers such as The Daily Times and The Punch in order to run outspoken
political columns.[8] Published throughout the 1970s and early 1980s under the
title Chief Priest Say, these columns were essentially extensions of Kuti's
famous Yabi Sessionsâconsciousness-raising word-sound rituals, with himself
as chief priest, conducted at his Lagos nightclub. Organized around a
militantly Afrocentric rendering of history and the essence of black beauty,
Chief Priest Say focused on the role of cultural hegemony in the continuing
subjugation of Africans. Kuti addressed a number of topics, from explosive
denunciations of the Nigerian Government's criminal behavior; Islam and
Christianity's exploitive nature, and evil multinationals; to deconstructions
of Western medicine, Black Muslims, sex, pollution, and poverty. Chief Priest
Say was cancelled, first by Daily Times then by Punch, ostensibly due to non-
payment, but many commentators have speculated that the paper's respective
editors were placed under increasingly violent pressure to stop publication.
