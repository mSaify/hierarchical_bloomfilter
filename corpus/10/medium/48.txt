## [edit] Biography

Banks's father was an officer in the Admiralty and his mother was once a
professional ice skater. Banks studied English, philosophy, and psychology at
the University of Stirling.

### [edit] Personal life

After attending the University of Stirling, Banks moved to London and lived in
the south of England until 1988 when he returned to Scotland, living in
Edinburgh and then Fife.[1]

Banks met his wife Annie in London, before the release of his first book. They
married in Hawaii in 1992.[2] However, he announced in early 2007 that, after
25 years together, they had separated.[3] He currently lives in North
Queensferry, a town on the north side of the Firth of Forth near the Forth
Bridge and the Forth Road Bridge.

In February 2007, Banks sold his extensive car collection, including a bottle
green 3.2 litre Porsche Boxster, a burgundy Porsche 911 Turbo, a 3.8 litre
Jaguar Mark II, a 5 litre black BMW M5 and a daily use diesel Land Rover
Defender whose power he had boosted by about 50%. Banks traded all of the
vehicles for a Lexus RX 400h hybrid - since replaced by a diesel Toyota Yaris
- and vowed in the future to fly only in emergencies.[4]

While interested in technology, he is also known to be reluctant to use the
internet and email, though he likes some PC computer games, including the
famous Civilization game, which he noted as having played a lot and as having
even provided some minor inspiration to his stories.[5]

### [edit] Politics

As with his friend Ken MacLeod (another Scottish writer of technical and
social science fiction) a strong awareness of left-wing history shows in his
writings. The argument that an economy of abundance renders anarchy and
adhocracy viable (or even inevitable) attracts many as an interesting
potential experiment, were it ever to become testable. He was a signatory to
the Declaration of Calton Hill, which calls for Scottish independence.[6]

In late 2004, Banks was a prominent member of a group of British politicians
and media figures who campaigned to have Prime Minister Tony Blair impeached
following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In protest he cut up his passport and
posted it to 10 Downing Street. In an interview in Socialist Review he claimed
he did this after he "abandoned the idea of crashing my Land Rover through the
gates of Fife dockyard, after spotting the guys armed with machine guns."[7]
He relates his concerns about the invasion of Iraq in his book Raw Spirit, and
the principal protagonist (Alban McGill) in the novel The Steep Approach to
Garbadale confronts another character with arguments in a similar vein.

Banks is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society (see
Quotations) and a Distinguished Supporter of the Humanist Society of Scotland.

### [edit] Names

Interviewed on Mark Lawson's BBC Four series, first broadcast in the UK on 14
November 2006, Banks explained why his novels are published under two
different names. His parents wished to name him Iain Menzies Banks but his
father made a mistake when registering the birth and he was officially
registered as Iain Banks. Despite this he continued to use his unofficial
middle name and it was as Iain M. Banks that he submitted The Wasp Factory for
publication. However, his editor asked if he would mind dropping the 'M' as it
appeared "too fussy". The editor was also concerned about possible confusion
with Rosie M. Banks, a minor character in some of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves
novels who is a romantic novelist. After his first three mainstream novels his
publishers agreed to publish his first SF novel, Consider Phlebas. To
distinguish between the mainstream and SF novels, Banks suggested the return
of the 'M', although at one stage he considered John B. Macallan as his SF
pseudonym, the name deriving from his favourite whiskies: Johnnie Walker Black
Label and The Macallan single malt.

## [edit] Quotes

Sister project Wikiquote has a collection of quotations related to: Iain Banks  
  * "I write because I love it, I enjoy it, I've spent most of my life trying to do it better, and I can make a living from it: beats a day job."[9]
  * "The Universe says simply, but with every possible complication, 'Existence' and it neither pressures us nor draws us out, except as we allow. It all boils down to nothing, and where we have the means and will to fix our reference within that flux, then there we are. Let me be part of that outrageous chaosâ¦ and I am."[10]
  * "In all the human societies we have ever reviewed, in every age and in every state, there has seldom if ever been a shortage of eager young males prepared to kill and die to preserve the security, comfort and prejudices of their elders, and what you call heroism is just an expression of this fact; there is never a scarcity of idiots." (Use of Weapons)
  * (CNN: Would you like to live in the Culture?) 
    IMB: "Good grief yes, heck, yeah, oh it's my secular heaven â¦ Yes, I would, absolutely â¦ I haven't done a study and taken lots of replies across a cross-section of humanity to find out what would be their personal utopia. It's mine, I thought of it, and I'm going home with it â absolutely, it's great."[11]
