ÐÐµÑÐ½Ð°Ð´ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹) (March 12 [O.S. February 28] 1863 - January 6, 1945) was
a soviet mineralogist and geochemist whose ideas of noosphere were an
important contribution to Russian cosmism. He also worked in Ukraine where he
founded the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. He is most noted for his
1926 book The Biosphere in which he inadvertently worked to popularize Eduard
Suessâ 1885 term biosphere, by hypothesizing that life is the geological
force that shapes the earth. He was a founding father of several new
disciplines, including geochemistry, biogeochemistry, and radiogeology.

## [edit] Biography

Vernadsky was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, on March 12, 1863, of
mixed Russian and Ukrainian parents. His father, a descendent of Ukrainian
Cossacks,[1] had been a professor of political economy in Kiev before moving
to Saint Petersburg, and his mother was a noble woman of Russian ethnicity.[2]
He himself considered himself both Russian and Ukrainian, and had some
knowledge of the Ukrainian language, but was loyal to the Russian state and
was opposed to Ukrainian independence. [3]

Vernadsky graduated from Saint Petersburg University in 1885. As the last
mineralogist had died in 1887 in Russia, and Dokuchaev, a soil scientist, and
A.P. Pavlov, a geologist, had been teaching mineralogy for a while, Vernadsky
chose to enter Mineralogy. He wrote to his wife Natasha Vernadsky on 20 June
1888 from Switzerland:

    "...to collect facts for their own sake, as many now gather facts, without a program, without a question to answer or a purpose is not interesting. However, there is a task which someday those chemical reactions which took place at various points on earth; these reactions take place according to laws which are known to us, but which, we are allowed to think, are closely tied to general changes which the earth has undergone by the earth with the general laws of celestial mechanics. I believe there is hidden here still more to discover when one considers the complexity of chemical elements and the regularity of their occurrence in groups..."
While trying to find a topic for his doctorate, he first went to Naples to
study with the crystallographer Scacchi, who was senile at that time. The
senility of Scacchi lead Vernadsky to go to Germany to study under Paul Groth.
There, Vernadsky learned how to use the modern equipment of Groth who had
developed a machine to study the optical, thermal, elastic, magnetic and
electrical properties of crystals, as well as using the physics lab of Prof.
Zonke, who was also working on crystallisation.

Vernadsky first popularized the concept of the noosphere and deepened the idea
of the biosphere to the meaning largely recognized by today's scientific
community. The word biosphere was invented by Austrian geologist Eduard Suess,
whom Vernadsky had met in 1911.

In Vernadsky's theory of how the Earth develops, the noosphere is the third
stage in a succession of phases of development of the earth, after the
geosphere (inanimate matter) and the biosphere (biological life). Just as the
emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of
human cognition fundamentally transformed the biosphere. In this theory, the
principles of both life and cognition are the essential features of the
earth's evolution, and must have been implicit in the earth all along. This
systemic and geological analysis of living systems complements Darwin's theory
of natural selection,[citation needed] which looks at each individual species,
rather than at its relationship to a subsuming principle.

Vernadsky's visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West.
However, he was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen,
nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological
processes. In the 1920s, he published works arguing that living organisms
could reshape the planets as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was an
important pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.[4]

Vernadsky was the founder and the first president of the Ukrainian Academy of
Sciences in Kiev, Ukraine (1918), was the founder of the National Library of
Ukrainian State and worked closely with the Tavrida University in Crimea.
During the Russian Civil War, he hosted the gatherings of the young
intellectuals who later founded the Ã©migrÃ© Eurasianist movement.[5] One of
the main avenues in both Moscow and Tavrida National University, Crimea are
named after him.

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Vernadsky played an early advisory role in
the Soviet atomic bomb project, as one of the most forceful voices arguing for
the exploitation of atomic energy, the surveying of Soviet uranium sources,
and having nuclear fission research conducted at his Radium Institute. He
died, however, before a full project was pursued.

Vernadsky's son George Vernadsky (1887-1973) emigrated to the United States
where he published numerous books on medieval Russian history as well as
medieval Ukrainian history and modern Russian history.
