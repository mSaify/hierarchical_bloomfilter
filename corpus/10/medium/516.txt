## [edit] Background

The son of civil rights activists, Cary and Carolyn Booker, who were among the
first African-American executives at IBM, Booker was born in Washington, D.C.
and grew up in the predominantly white, affluent town of Harrington Park in
Bergen County, New Jersey.[1] He is an alumnus of Northern Valley Regional
High School at Old Tappan.[2] Booker traveled west to study at Stanford
University, where he earned a B.A. in political science in 1991 and an M.A. in
sociology the following year. He played varsity football â he made the
AllâPacific Ten Academic team; â and was elected to the council of (four)
presidents. While he was there, he ran The Bridge, a student-run crisis
hotline and organized help for youth in East Palo Alto from Stanford
students.[3]

He won a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where
he was awarded an honors degree in modern history in 1994. While at Oxford he
became friends with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach and Rachel Maddow. He became the
President of the L'Chaim Society, a Jewish group founded by Boteach, to
signify his commitment to end tensions between Jews and African Americans.

After Oxford, he obtained a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1997 and, while
there, started and operated free legal clinics for low-income residents of New
Haven. He was also a Big Brother, and was active in the Black Law Students
Association. After law school, Booker returned to New Jersey. He served as
Staff Attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and Program
Coordinator of the Newark Youth Project.

From 1998 to 2006, he lived in Brick Towers, a notorious public housing
project in Newark's Central Ward. Booker organized tenants there to fight for
improved conditions. In November 2006, Booker left his apartment for the top
unit in a three-story rental on Hawthorne Avenue on Newark's south side, an
area described as "a drug- and gang-plagued neighborhood of boarded-up houses
and empty lots."[4]

## [edit] Councilman

In 1998, Booker won an upset victory, beating an unorganized four-term
incumbent to get elected to the Newark City Council, a council known for its
corruption and hard-fought elections.

Once on the Council, Booker proved to be an unconventional public official. In
1999, he went on a 10-day hunger strike, living in a tent in front of one of
Newark's worst housing projects (Sunset Pines), to protest open-air drug
dealing. For five months in 2000 he lived in a contemporary motor home,
parking on street corners known to be places where drug trafficking occurred.

He proposed a variety of Council initiatives that impacted housing, young
people, law and order, and the efficiency of City Hall, but was regularly
rebuffed by a resistant City Council and often outvoted 8â1.

While on the Council, Booker became an advocate of school vouchers as part of
a reform of the education system.

## [edit] 2002 Mayoral run

In 2002, rather than run for re-election as Councilman, Booker decided to run
for Mayor of Newark. This pitted him against longtime mayor, Sharpe James. In
this campaign and the next, James' supporters questioned Booker's suburban
background, calling him a carpetbagger who was "not black enough" to
understand the city.[5] Booker was defeated, 53 percent to 47 percent.
Filmmaker Marshall Curry chronicles the campaign in his documentary Street
Fight, which was nominated for the 2005 Academy Award for Best Documentary
Feature.

After concluding his service as a Councilman, in 2003 Booker founded, and
became the director of, Newark Now, a grassroots nonprofit group. He also
became a partner at the West Orange law firm, Booker, Rabinowitz, et al., and
a senior fellow at Rutgers University's Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning
and Public Policy. Booker also became a member of the Board of Trustees at
Teachers College, Columbia University, a member of the Executive Committee at
Yale Law School and was formerly a member of the Board of Trustees at Stanford
University.

## [edit] 2006 Mayoral run

As expected, Cory Booker announced on February 11, 2006 that he would again
run for mayor, an intention he had made clear after his loss in 2002.

On March 6, 2006, Deputy Mayor (and State Senator) Ronald Rice entered the
race, adding "that Mayor James had encouraged him to run but noted that if the
mayor decided to join the race, his candidacy could change." [6] On March 27,
2006, James announced that he would not seek a sixth term, preferring to focus
on his seat in the New Jersey Senate. [7]

Rice ran a campaign attacking Booker for raising over $6 million for the race.
Booker's campaign outspent Rice's 25 to 1. Booker tried to identify Rice as a
"political crony" of former mayor Sharpe James, to whom Booker lost in 2002.
[8] [9]

On Election Day, May 9, 2006, Newark's nonpartisan election took place. Booker
won with 72 percent of the vote, soundly defeating Rice. Booker's entire slate
of City Council candidates, known as the "Booker Team," swept the Council
elections, giving Booker firm leadership of the city's government.

On May 31, 2006, before taking office as Mayor, Booker sued Newark to stop the
city from selling land at prices he felt were too low. The land was mainly
sold at prices ranging from $1 to $4 per square foot. The city council argued
that this was the only way to promote development in Newark's blighted
neighborhoods. Booker was also criticized by council members because, as a
councilman, he approved of some of these deals. Booker's attorneys argued that
the city had violated the state's "pay-to-play" law by rewarding campaign
contributors with land deals at favorable financial terms. On June 20, 2006,
Superior Court Judge Patricia Costello ruled in favor of Booker, stating that
his attorneys had "made a persuasive argument that campaign contributors were
given discounted land deals". [10]

Days before Booker took office in late June, New Jersey investigators foiled a
plot, led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons, to
assassinate Booker. The plot was led by New Jersey Bloods gang leader Lester
Alford, an inmate in East Jersey State Prison in Woodbridge Township, New
Jersey. The plan called for prisoners in four New Jersey state prisons to riot
and then for Bloods gang members on the outside to simultaneously assassinate
Booker. Booker has been placed under 24-hour surveillance by the Newark Police
Department. The threats against Booker are believed to be in response to
Booker's campaign promises to increase the number of police on the streets and
take a harder line on crime.[11][12][13]

## [edit] Mayoral administration

Booker assumed office as mayor of Newark on July 1, 2006, just the third
person to govern the city since 1970.[14] [15] [16] After a week, Booker
announced a 100-day plan to implement reforms in Newark. The centerpiece was
adding police officers; other changes included ending background checks for
many city jobs, an effort to help former offenders find employment in the
city; refurbishing police stations; improving city services; and expanding
summer youth programs. [17] [18]

Booker campaigned for U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman in Connecticut on August 6,
2006, two days before the Democratic primary pitting Lieberman against
challenger Ned Lamont.[19] [20]

On August 21, 2006, Booker formally introduced his proposed Newark City Budget
before the Municipal Council for approval. Booker's $697.1 million budget
called for an 8.3% increase in the city's property tax, which if passed would
be one of the largest property tax increases in the city's history. The budget
would also increase the number of city employees from 3,968 to 4,197. [21]
[22]

Booker appointed Garry McCarthy, a former police commander of Manhattan's 33rd
Precinct in the late 1990s, as the director of the Newark Police Department.
McCarthy was credited with sharply reducing crime in the precinct but was also
criticized by some for methods including setting up police barricades around
neighborhoods to monitor the drug trade. [23]

Booker's administration has held monthly office hours with city residents
where residents can meet personally with the Mayor to discuss their problems.
[24]

Booker is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition[25], a bi-
partisan group with a stated goal of "making the public safer by getting
illegal guns off the streets." The Coalition is co-chaired by Boston mayor
Thomas Menino and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

## [edit] Personal life

Cory Booker has an older brother, Cary. Cory is known to be personal friends
with former New York Giants star Tiki Barber [26] and President Barack
Obama.[27] As mentioned in Street Fight, Booker is a vegetarian, who does not
drink or smoke.
