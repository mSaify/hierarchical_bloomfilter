### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

Theodore Sturgeon (born Edward Hamilton Waldo on February 26 1918; died May 8
1985) was an American science fiction author.

Though his mainstream success was relatively limited, Sturgeon is now widely
recognized as one of the most important and influential science fiction
writers of his era. Many of Sturgeon's works have a poetic, even an elegiac,
quality. He was known to use a technique known as "rhythmic prose", in which
his prose text would drop into a standard poetic meter. This has the effect of
creating a subtle shift in mood, usually without alerting the reader to its
cause.

His most famous novel More Than Human (1953) won serious academic recognition
as literature, a rarity amongst science fiction works of the '50s.

## [edit] Biography

He was born in Staten Island, New York. In 1929, after a divorce, his mother
married the Scot William Dicky ("Argylle") Sturgeon, and Edward changed his
name to Theodore the better to match his childhood nickname, "Teddy", and
distinguish himself from his father, also named Edward.[1] Although "Theodore
Sturgeon" is frequently misidentified as a pseudonym, it was in fact his legal
name since the age of eight.[2]

He sold his first story in 1938 to the newspaper McClure's Syndicate, which
bought much of his early (non-fantastic) work; his first genre appearance was
"Ether Breather" in Astounding Science Fiction a year later. At first he wrote
mainly short stories, primarily for genre magazines such as Astounding and
Unknown, but also for general-interest publications such as Argosy Magazine.
He used the pen name "E. Waldo Hunter" when two of his stories ran in the same
issue of Astounding. A few of his early stories were signed "Theodore H.
Sturgeon".

Sturgeon ghost-wrote an Ellery Queen mystery novel, The Player on the Other
Side (Random House, 1963). This novel gained critical praise from critic
H.R.F. Keating, who "had almost finished writing Crime and Mystery: the 100
Best Books, in which I had included The Player on the Other Side ... placing
the book squarely in the Queen canon"[3] when he learned that it had been
written by Sturgeon. Similarly, "William DeAndrea, author and ... winner of
Mystery Writers of America awards, selecting his ten favourite mystery novels
for the magazine Armchair Detective, picked The Player on the Other Side as
one of them. He said: 'This book changed my life ... and made a raving mystery
fan (and therefore ultimately a mystery writer) out of me. ... The book must
be 'one of the most skilful pastiches in the history of literature. An amazing
piece of work, whomever did it'."[3]

Sturgeon wrote the screenplays for the Star Trek episodes "Shore Leave" (1966)
and "Amok Time" (1967, later published as a "Fotonovel" in 1978). The latter
is known for his invention of the pon farr, the Vulcan mating ritual, the
first use of the phrase "Live long and prosper" and the first use of the
Vulcan hand symbol. Sturgeon also wrote several episodes of Star Trek that
were never produced. One of these was notable for having first introduced the
Prime Directive. He also wrote an episode of the Saturday morning show Land of
the Lost, "The Pylon Express", in 1975. Two of Sturgeon's stories were adapted
for The New Twilight Zone. One, "A Saucer of Loneliness", was broadcast in
1986 and was dedicated to his memory. His 1944 novella, "KillDozer", was the
inspiration for the 1970s made-for-TV movie, Marvel comic book, and
alternative rock band of the same name.

Although Sturgeon is well known among readers of classic science-fiction
anthologies (at the height of his popularity in the 1950s he was the most
anthologized author alive) and much respected by critics (John Clute writes in
The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction: "His influence upon writers like Harlan
Ellison and Samuel R. Delany was seminal, and in his life and work he was a
powerful and generally liberating influence in post-WWII US sf"), he is not
much known among the general public and won comparatively few awards (though
it must be noted that his best work was published before the establishment and
consolidation of the leading genre awards, while his later production was
scarcer and weaker). He was listed as a primary influence of the much more
famous Ray Bradbury. Kurt Vonnegut based his character Kilgore Trout on
Theodore Sturgeon.

Sturgeon died on May 8, 1985, of lung fibrosis, in Eugene, Oregon.[4] Sturgeon
lived for several years in the neighboring city of Springfield. [5]

## [edit] Sturgeon's Law

Main article: Sturgeon's law

In 1951, Sturgeon coined what is now known as Sturgeon's Law: "Ninety percent
of SF [science fiction] is crud, but then, ninety percent of everything is
crud." This was originally known as Sturgeon's Revelation; Sturgeon has said
that "Sturgeon's Law" was originally "Nothing is always absolutely so."
However, the former phrase is now widely referred to as Sturgeon's Law. He is
also known for his dedication to a credo of critical thinking that challenged
all normative assumptions: "ask the next question." He represented this credo
by the symbol of a Q with an arrow through it, an example of which he wore
around his neck and used as part of his signature in the last 15 years of his
life.

## [edit] Life and family

Sturgeon was a distant relative of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and through his Waldo,
Hamilton Dicker and Dunn ancestors, a direct descendant of numerous
influential Anglican clergymen. Both Sturgeon and his brother Peter were
eventually to become atheists[citation needed], although Sturgeon continuously
developed his own, highly imaginative spiritual side. If Sturgeon had been
aware of much of his ancestry and any stories associated with it, he never
shared these with his friends or offspring, although the short "I Say--Ernest"
(1972) does bring to life one wing of his ministerial family. True to his
nature, he did not attribute much to the notion of "bloodline," and, according
to certain of his children, thoroughly despised class-consciousness.

Sturgeon's one sibling, Peter Sturgeon, wrote technical material for the
pharmaceutical industry and eventually for the WHO, has been credited with
bringing Mensa to the United States. Edward Waldo, their birth father, was a
color and dye manufacturer of middling success. Their mother, Christine
Hamilton Dicker (Waldo) Sturgeon, was a well-educated writer, watercolorist,
and poet who published journalism, poetry and fiction under the name Felix
Sturgeon. William Dicky Sturgeon (sometimes known as Argyll), their
stepfather, was a mathematics teacher at a prep school and then Romance
Languages Professor at Drexel Institute of Technology in Philadelphia.

Sturgeon held a wide variety of jobs during his lifetime. As an adolescent, he
wanted to be a circus acrobat; an episode of rheumatic fever prevented him
from pursuing this. From 1935 (aged 17) to 1938, he was a sailor in the
merchant marine, and elements of that experience found their way into several
stories. He sold refrigerators door to door. He managed a hotel in the West
Indies around 1940-1941, worked in several construction and infrastructure
jobs (driving a bulldozer in Puerto Rico, operating a gas station and truck
lubrication center, work at a drydock) for the US Army in the early war years,
and by 1944 was an advertising copywriter. In addition to freelance fiction
and television writing, he also operated a literary agency (which was
eventually transferred to Scott Meredith), worked for Fortune Magazine and
other Time Magazine Inc. properties on circulation, and edited various
publications. Sturgeon had somewhat irregular output, frequently suffering
from writer's block.

Theodore Sturgeon vividly recalled being in the same room with L. Ron Hubbard,
when Hubbard became testy with someone there and retorted, "Y'know, we're all
wasting our time writing this hack science fiction! You wanta make real money,
you gotta start a religion!" Reportedly Sturgeon also told this story to
others.

Sturgeon played guitar and wrote music which he sometimes performed at Science
Fiction Conventions.

Sturgeon was married three times, had two long-term committed relationships
outside of marriage, divorced once, and fathered a total of seven children.
His first wife was Dorothe Fillingame (married 1940, divorced 1945) with whom
he had two daughters, Patricia and Cynthia. He was married to singer Mary Mair
from 1949 until an annulment in 1951. Later in 1951, he wed Marion McGahan
with whom he had a son, Robin (b. 1952); daughters Tandy (b. 1954) and NoÃ«l
(b. 1956); and son Timothy (b. 1960). His fourth long-term committed
relationship was with reporter and photographer W. Bonnie Golden, with whom he
had a son, Andros (b.1970). Finally, his last long-term committed relationship
was with writer and educator Jayne Engelhart Tannehill, with whom he remained
until the time of his death.

Sturgeon was a lifelong pipe smoker. Since pipe smoke is not inhaled in the
lungs this probably had little connection with his death from lung fibrosis;
rather, the condition may have been caused by exposure to asbestos during his
Merchant Marine stint as a young man.
