## [edit] Plot summary

The novel's protagonist, Dexter Morgan, works for the Miami-Dade Police
Department as a forensic blood spatter pattern analyst. In his spare time,
Dexter is a serial killer with a catch: he only kills murderers that he
believes have escaped judicial punishment.

Dexter's murders are directed by an inner voice he refers to as the "Dark
Passenger", who keeps prodding Dexter to kill something. Once he has done so,
the voice is satisfied for a while, but always comes back.

Flashbacks reveal that his foster father, a police detective named Harry
Morgan, taught him how to kill people who have gotten away with murder as a
way to channel his homicidal urges in a "positive" direction. Harry taught
young Dexter to be a careful, meticulous killer, to leave no clues, and to be
absolutely sure his victims are guilty before killing them. Dexter calls these
rules "the code of Harry".

Dexter manages his double life reasonably well for years, but is unprepared
when a serial killer with an artistic and playful style that impresses Dexter
starts terrorizing Miami's prostitutes. As the "Tamiami Butcher" rampages
through the city, he begins sending messages to Dexter, who finds the series
of terrifying crimes engrossing and fascinating. Meanwhile, his sister,
Deborah, sees the series of murders as her ticket out of the Vice unit and
into Homicide, and has asked Dexter to help her in her ambitions. Dexter is
torn between helping his sister to catch the killer and a desire to sit back
and admire the artistry and skill of a fellow killer's work.

## [edit] Narrative style

Darkly Dreaming Dexter provides a first-person story narrated by a serial
killer.

Dexter claims to be devoid of human emotion, but he does harbor feelings of a
sort for the people in his life, including his sister, Deborah, as well as his
girlfriend, Rita, and her children, Astor and Cody. By the novel's climax, he
admits to himself that he is "fond" of them, the closest he can get to feeling
love.

As a narrator, Dexter tries to maintain a sense of black humor while telling
the story, even when it turns grim. He also uses numerous alliterative
phrases, typically featuring three prominent D sounds (e.g. Darkly Dreaming
Dexter, The Dark DefenDer).

## [edit] Television series

Main article: Dexter (TV series)

The novel was the basis for an original TV series on Showtime. Whereas the
first season largely followed the plot lines of Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the
second and third seasons contained original storylines not directly based on
the novel. A fourth season is near production, and is expected to air in late
2009.

Darkly Dreaming Dexter was featured on an episode of Booked, a Canadian
television series that investigates crime fiction novels through the eyes of
real CSI experts.[1]

## [edit] Awards and nominations

Darkly Dreaming Dexter won the 2005 Dilys Award presented by the Independent
Mystery Booksellers Association.[2]
