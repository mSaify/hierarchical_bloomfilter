leader and scholar, politician, and leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution
which saw the overthrow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the late Shah of Iran.
Following the revolution and a national referendum, Khomeini became the
country's Supreme Leaderâa position created in the constitution as the
highest ranking political and religious authority of the nation, until his
death.

Khomeini was a marja or marja al-taqlid, ("source of emulation"), (also known
as a Grand Ayatollah) in Twelver Shi'a Islam, but is most famous for his
political role. In his writings and preachings he expanded the Shi'a Usuli
theory of velayat-e faqih, the "guardianship of the jurisconsult (clerical
authority)" to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists and to
provide the theological basis for his rule of Iran.

Beloved by millions of Iranians,[3] Khomeini was a "charismatic leader of
immense popularity,"[4] and both his return from exile and his funeral were
occasions of great emotional outpouring for millions. Abroad he was known for
his support of the hostage takers during the Iranian hostage crisis [5] and
his fatwa calling for the death of British citizen Salman Rushdie.[6] The
"virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture,"[7] Khomeini was named Man
of the Year in 1979 by TIME magazine,[8] and became known outside of his
supporters as a "fanatic whose judgments are harsh, reasoning bizarre and
conclusions surreal"[8] who "inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam"
during his reign.[7]

Khomeini is usually known as "Imam Khomeini" inside Iran[9] and amongst his
followers internationally, and "Ayatollah Khomeini" outside of Iran.[10]

## [edit] Early life

The young Khomeini

Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini was born to Mustafa Musawi[11] and Hajiyah Aga Khanum
in the town of Khomein,[12] about 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of Tehran,
on[13] September 24, 1902.[1][2] Khomeini is called a sayyid as his family
traces its descent from the seventh of the Twelve Imams, Musa al-
Kazim.[12][14] Several of his close ancestors were dedicated to Islamic
studies: his father and both of his grandfathers were all Shia clerics.[15]
Khomeini's paternal grandfather, Sayid Ahmad Musawi Hindi, spent many years in
India before returning to Persia to purchase a home in Khomein that his family
would own until the late twentieth century.[11][16] [17] Khomeini's father was
murdered when he was still an infant. Khomeini's supporters assert that
Khomeini's father was killed by Reza Shah, however this Shah would not come to
power for another twenty-six years.[18] Many historians today believe his
father may have been the victim of a local dispute.[19][20] Khomeini's mother
and one of his aunts proceeded to raise him until 1918, when both of them
died.[21] Ruhollah Khomeini began to study the Qur'an, Islam's holiest book,
and elementary Persian at age six [22]. The following year, he began to attend
a local school, where he learned mathematics, science, geography, and other
traditional subjects.[21] Throughout his childhood, he would continue his
religious and secular education with the assistance of his relatives,
including his mother's cousin, Ja'far,[21] and his elder brother, Morteza
Pasandideh.[23]

After World War I arrangements were made for him to study at the Islamic
seminary in Esfahan, but he was attracted instead to the seminary in Arak,
under the leadership of Ayatollah Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi.[24] In 1920,
Khomeini moved to Arak and commenced his studies.[25] The following year,
Ayatollah Haeri Yazdi transferred the Islamic seminary to the holy city of
Qom, southwest of Tehran, and invited his students to follow. Khomeini
accepted the invitation, moved,[23] and took up residence at the Dar al-Shafa
school in Qom.[26] Khomeini's studies included Islamic law (sharia) and
jurisprudence (fiqh)[22], but by that time, Khomeini had also acquired an
interest in poetry and philosophy (irfan). So, upon arriving in Qom, Khomeini
sought the guidance of Mirza Ali Akbar Yazdi, a scholar of philosophy and
mysticism. Yazdi died in 1924, but Khomeini would continue to pursue his
interest in philosophy with two other teachers, Javad Aqa Maleki Tabrizi and
Rafi'i Qazvini.[27][28] However, perhaps Khomeini's biggest influences were
yet another teacher, Mirza Muhammad 'Ali Shahabadi,[29] and a variety of
historic Sufi mystics, including Mulla Sadra and Ibn Arabi.[28]

Ruhollah Khomeini was a lecturer at Najaf and Qum seminaries for decades
before he was known in the political scene. He soon became a leading scholar
of Shia Islam.[30] He taught political philosophy[31], Islamic history and
ethics. Several of his students (e.g. Morteza Motahhari) later became leading
Islamic philosophers and also marja. As a scholar and teacher, Khomeini
produced numerous writings on Islamic philosophy, law, and ethics.[32] He
showed an exceptional interest in subjects like philosophy and gnosticism that
not only were usually absent from the curriculum of seminaries but were often
an object of hostility and suspicion. [33]

### [edit] Political aspects

His seminary teaching often focused on the importance of religion to practical
social and political issues of the day. He was the first Iranian cleric to try
to refute the outspoken advocacy of secularism in the 1940s. His first book,
Kashf al-Asrar (Uncovering of Secrets)[34][35][unreliable source?] published
in 1942, was a point-by-point refutation of Asrar-e hazar salih (Secrets of a
Thousand Years), a tract written by a disciple of Iran's leading anti-clerical
historian, Ahmad Kasravi.[36] In addition, he went from Qom to Tehran to
listen to Ayatullah Hasan Mudarris\- the leader of the opposition majority in
Iran's parliament during 1920s. Khomeini became a marja in 1963, following the
death of Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi.

Khomeini held a moderate standpoint vis-Ã -vis Greek Philosophy and regarded
Aristotle as the founder of logic.[37] He was also influenced by Plato's
philosophy. About Plato he said: "In the field of divinity, he has grave and
solid views ...". [38] Among Islamic philosophers, Khomeini was mainly
influenced by Avicenna and Mulla Sadra.[37]

Apart from philosophy, Khomeini was also interested in literature and poetry.
His poetry collection was released after his death. Beginning in his
adolescent years, Khomeini composed mystic, political and social poetry. There
is one of them âMass of the Drunk:

Khomeini

> In circles mystic I found not  
>  The pleasantness I sought  
>  In monastery was not audible  
>  The music which love wrought  
>  
>  In school I did not find to read  
>  Any book to be from the friend  
>  In minaret it was hard to find  
>  The voice to be of him to tend  
>  
>  In love of books I could not see  
>  That veiled beauty's face  
>  In sacred writs I could not get  
>  The destination's trace  
>  
>  In idol-house my life's span  
>  Was wholly spent in vain  
>  In rivals' gathering I saw  
>  Neither remedy nor pain  
>  
>  The lover's ring now must I join  
>  Haply to find for solace  
>  From the rose- garden of the beloved  
>  A pleasing breeze or a trace  
>  
>  "We" and "I" are both from reason  
>  That are used as ropes to bind  
>  In mass of those who are drunk  
>  Neither "I" is nor "We" to find[39]

His poetry works were published in three collections The Confidant, The
Decanter of Love and Turning Point and Divan.[40] Some of his poems are even
seen as criticizing spirituality and religion, like the one who was firstly
dedicated to a commander in Iran-Iraq war but which was published by his son
as a memorial to him. He even claims the controversial "I am the Truth" of the
Persian mystic Maná¹£Å«r al-á¸¤allÄj and uses the á¹¢Å«fÄ« terminology of
wine for instance.[41]

## [edit] Early political activity

At the age of 61, Khomeini found the arena of leadership open following the
deaths of Ayatollah Sayyed Husayn Borujerdi (1961), the leading, although
quiescent, Shiite religious leader; and Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani (1962),
an activist cleric. The clerical class had been on the defensive ever since
the 1920s when the secular, anti-clerical modernizer Reza Shah Pahlavi rose to
power. Reza's son Muhammad Reza Shah, instituted a "White Revolution," which
was a further challenge to the ulama.[42]

### [edit] Opposition to the White Revolution

In January 1963, the Shah announced the "White Revolution," a six-point
programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests,
the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to
enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in
industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these
initiatives were regarded as dangerous, Westernizing trends by
traditionalists, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama
(religious scholars).[43]

<IMG>

<IMG>

Khomeini and his son Mustafa

Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and
persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution.
On January 22, 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing
the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom,
and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.

Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a
manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia
religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had
allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption
in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to America and Israel. He
also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which
fell on March 21, 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government
policies.

On the afternoon of 'Ashura (June 3, 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the
Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the infamous tyrant Yazid and the
Shah, denouncing the Shah as a "wretched, miserable man," and warning him that
if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer
up thanks for his departure from the country.[44]

On June 5, 1963, (15 of Khordad), two days after this public denunciation of
the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was arrested. This sparked three days
of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event
is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad.[45] Khomeini was kept under
house arrest for 8 months and released in 1964.

### [edit] Opposition to capitulation

During November 1964, Khomeini denounced both the Shah and the United States,
this time in response to the "capitulations" or diplomatic immunity granted by
the Shah to American military personnel in Iran [46] [47]. The famous
"capitulation" law (or "status-of-forces agreement") would allow members of
the U.S. armed forces in Iran to be tried in their own military courts.
Khomeini was arrested in November 1964 and held for half a year. Upon his
release, he was brought before Prime Minister Hasan Ali Mansur, who tried to
convince Khomeini that he should apologize and drop his opposition to the
government. Khomeini refused. In fury, Mansur slapped Khomeini's face.[48] Two
weeks later, Mansur was assassinated on his way to parliament. Four members of
the Fadayan-e Islam were later executed for the murder.

Advisers to the Shah recommended executing the Ayatollah, perhaps an
accidental death[citation needed]. The Shah refused and sent Khomeini into
exile to Iraq.

## [edit] Life in exile

<IMG>

<IMG>

Khomeini at Neauphle-le-Chateau

Khomeini spent more than 14 years in exile, mostly in the holy Shia city of
Najaf, Iraq. Initially he was sent to Turkey on 4 November 1964 where he
stayed in the city of Bursa for less than a year. He was hosted by a colonel
in Turkish Military Intelligence named Ali Cetiner in his own residence, who
couldn't find another accommodation alternative for his stay at the time.[49]
Later in October 1965 he was allowed to move to Najaf, Iraq, where he stayed
until being forced to leave in 1978, after then-Vice President Saddam Hussein
forced him out (the two countries would fight a bitter eight year war
1980-1988 only a year after the two reached power in 1979) after which he went
to Neauphle-le-ChÃ¢teau in France on a tourist visa, apparently not seeking
political asylum, where he stayed for four months. According to Alexandre de
Marenches, chief of External Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service (now
known as the DGSE), France would have suggested to the shah to "organize a
fatal accident for Khomeini"; the shah declined the assassination offer, as
that would have made Khomeini a martyr.

By the late 1960s, Khomeini was a marja-e taqlid (model for imitation) for
"hundreds of thousands" of Shia, one of six or so models in the Shia
world.[50]

While in the 1940s Khomeini accepted the idea of a limited monarchy under the
Iranian Constitution of 1906-1907 â as evidenced by his book Kashf al-Asrar
â by the 1970s he rejected the idea.

In early 1970, Khomeini gave a series of lectures in Najaf on Islamic
government, later published as a book titled variously Islamic Government or
Islamic Government: Authority of the Jurist (Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e
faqih).

Main article: Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)

This was his most famous and influential work, and laid out his ideas on
governance (at that time):

  * That the laws of society should be made up only of the laws of God (Sharia), which cover "all human affairs" and "provide instruction and establish norms" for every "topic" in "human life." [51]

  * Since Shariah, or Islamic law, is the proper law, those holding government posts should have knowledge of Sharia. Since Islamic jurists or faqih have studied and are the most knowledgeable in Sharia, the country's ruler should be a faqih who "surpasses all others in knowledge" of Islamic law and justice,[52] (known as a marja'), as well as having intelligence and administrative ability. Rule by monarchs and/or assemblies of "those claiming to be representatives of the majority of the people" (i.e. elected parliaments and legislatures) has been proclaimed "wrong" by Islam.[53]

  * This system of clerical rule is necessary to prevent injustice, corruption, oppression by the powerful over the poor and weak, innovation and deviation of Islam and Sharia law; and also to destroy anti-Islamic influence and conspiracies by non-Muslim foreign powers. [54]

A modified form of this wilayat al-faqih system was adopted after Khomeini and
his followers took power, and Khomeini was the Islamic Republic's first
"Guardian" or Supreme Leader.

government institutions

In the meantime, however, Khomeini was careful not to publicize his ideas for
clerical rule outside of his Islamic network of opposition to the Shah which
he worked to build and strengthen over the next decade.

In Iran, a number of actions of the shah including his repression of opponents
began to build opposition to his regime.

Further information: Iranian Revolution#1970s: Pre-revolutionary conditions
and events inside Iran

Cassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah as (for example)
"... the Jewish agent, the American snake whose head must be smashed with a
stone", [55] became common items in the markets of Iran, [56] helped to
demythologize the power and dignity of the Shah and his reign. Aware of the
importance of broadening his base, Khomeini reached out to Islamic reformist
and secular enemies of the Shah, despite his long-term ideological
incompatibility with them.

After the 1977 death of Dr. Ali Shariati (an Islamic reformist and political
revolutionary author/academic/philosopher who greatly popularized the Islamic
revival among young educated Iranians), Khomeini became the most influential
leader of the opposition to the Shah. He was perceived by many Iranians as the
spiritual, if not political, leader of revolt. Adding to his mystique was the
circulation among Iranians in the 1970s of an old Shia saying attributed to
the Imam Musa al-Kadhem. Prior to his death in 799, al-Kadhem was said to have
prophesied that "A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the
right path".[57] In late 1978, a rumour swept the country that Khomeini's face
could be seen in the full moon. Millions of people were said to have seen it
and the event was celebrated in thousands of mosques.[58]

As protest grew so did his profile and importance. Although thousands of
kilometers away from Iran in Paris, Khomeini set the course of the revolution,
urging Iranians not to compromise and ordering work stoppages against the
regime.[59] During the last few months of his exile, Khomeini received a
constant stream of reporters, supporters, and notables, eager to hear the
spiritual leader of the revolution.[60]

### [edit] Return to Iran

<IMG>

<IMG>

Arrival of Khomeini on February 1, 1979 When asked about his feelings of
returning from exile in the plane, he replied that he had none.

Main article: Iranian Revolution

Khomeini had refused to return to Iran until the Shah left. On January 16,
1979, the Shah did leave the country (ostensibly "on vacation"), never to
return. Two weeks later, on Thursday, February 1, 1979, Khomeini returned in
triumph to Iran, welcomed by a joyous crowd estimated at at least six million
by ABC News reporter Peter Jennings, who was reporting the event from Tehran.

On the airplane on his way to Iran, Khomeini was asked by reporter Peter
Jennings: "What do you feel in returning to Iran?" Khomeini answered "Hichi"
(nothing) [61]. This statement was considered reflective of his mystical or
puritanical belief that Dar al-Islam, rather than the motherland, was what
mattered, and also a warning to Iranians who hoped he would be a "mainstream
nationalist leader" that they were in for disappointment.[62]

Khomeini adamantly opposed the provisional government of Shapour Bakhtiar,
promising "I shall kick their teeth in. I appoint the government. I appoint
the government by support of this nation."[63][64] On February 11 [(Bahman
22)], Khomeini appointed his own competing interim prime minister, Mehdi
Bazargan, demanding, "since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed." It was
"God's government," he warned, disobedience against which was a "revolt
against God."[65]

### [edit] Establishment of new government

As Khomeini's movement gained momentum soldiers began to defect to his side,
and Khomeini declared jihad on soldiers who did not surrender.[66] On February
11 [(Bahman 22)], as revolt spread and armories were taken over, the military
declared neutrality and the Bakhtiar regime collapsed.[67] On March 30, 1979,
and March 31, 1979, a referendum to replace the monarchy with an Islamic
Republic passed with 98% voting yes (sic).[68]

### [edit] Islamic constitution

Although revolutionaries were now in charge and Khomeini was their leader,
several secular and religious were unaware of Khomeini's plan for Islamic
government by wilayat al-faqih, which involved rule by a marja' Islamic
cleric.[69] This provisional constitution for the Islamic Republic did not
include the post of supreme Islamic clerical ruler.[70][71][verification
needed]

Khomeini and his supporters worked to suppress some former allies and rewrote
the proposed constitution. Some newspapers were closed, and those protesting
the closings were attacked.[72] Opposition groups such as the National
Democratic Front and Muslim People's Republican Party were attacked and
finally banned.[73] Through popular support and with charges of questionable
balloting, Khomeini supporters gained an overwhelming majority of the seats of
the Assembly of Experts[74] which revised the proposed constitution. The newly
proposed constitution included an Islamic jurist Supreme Leader of the
country, and a Council of Guardians to veto un-Islamic legislation and screen
candidates for office, disqualifying those found un-Islamic.

In November 1979, the new constitution of the Islamic Republic was adopted by
national referendum.[75] Khomeini himself became instituted as the Supreme
Leader (supreme jurist ruler), and officially became known as the "Leader of
the Revolution." On February 4, 1980, Abolhassan Banisadr was elected as the
first president of Iran.

### [edit] Hostage crisis

Main article: Iran hostage crisis

On 22 October 1979 the United States admitted the exiled and ailing Shah into
the country for cancer treatment. In Iran there was an immediate outcry with
both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial
and execution. Revolutionaries were reminded of Operation Ajax, 26 years
earlier when the Shah fled abroad while American CIA and British intelligence
organized a coup d'Ã©tat to overthrow his nationalist opponent.

On 4 November, Islamist students calling themselves Muslim Student Followers
of the Imam's Line took control of the American Embassy in Tehran, holding 52
embassy staff hostage for 444 days - an event known as the Iran hostage
crisis. In America, the hostage-taking was seen as a flagrant violation of
international law and aroused intense anger and anti-Iranian feeling.[76][77]
In Iran the takeover was immensely popular and earned the support of Khomeini
under the slogan "America can't do a damn thing against us."[78] The seizure
helped to advance the cause of theocratic government and outflank politicians
and groups who emphasized stability and normalized relations with other
countries. Khomeini is reported to have told his president: "This action has
many benefits ... this has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act
against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without
difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections."[79] The
new theocratic constitution was successfully passed by referendum a month
after the hostage crisis began. The effect was the splitting of the opposition
into two groups - radicals supporting the hostage taking, and the moderates
who opposed it.[79][80] On February 23, 1980, Khomeini proclaimed Iran's
Majlis would decide the fate of the American embassy hostages, and demanded
that the United States hand over the Shah for trial in Iran for crimes against
the nation. Although the Shah died a few months later, during the summer, the
crisis continued. In Iran, supporters of Khomeini named the embassy a "Den of
Espionage", publicizing details regarding armaments, espionage equipment and
many volumes of official and classified documents which they found there.

### [edit] Relationship with other Islamic and non-aligned countries

Khomeini believed in Muslim unity and solidarity and the export of Islamic
revolution throughout the world. "Establishing the Islamic state world-wide
belong to the great goals of the revolution."[81] He declared the birth week
of Muhammad (the week between 12th to 17th of Rabi' al-awwal) as the Unity
week. Then he declared the last Friday of Ramadan as International Day of Quds
in 1979.

Despite his devotion to Islam, Khomeini also emphasized international
revolutionary solidarity, expressing support for the PLO, the IRA, Cuba, and
the South African anti-apartheid struggle.

### [edit] Iran-Iraq War

Main article: IranâIraq War

Shortly after assuming power, Khomeini began calling for Islamic revolutions
across the Muslim world, including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq,[82] the one
large state besides Iran with a Shia majority population. At the same time
Saddam Hussein, Iraq's secular Arab nationalist Ba'athist leader, was eager to
take advantage of Iran's weakened military and (what he assumed was)
revolutionary chaos, and in particular to occupy Iran's adjacent oil-rich
province of Khuzestan, and, of course, to undermine Iranian Islamic
revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country.

With what many Iranians believe was the encouragement of the United States,
Saudi Arabia and other countries, in September 1980 Iraq launched a full scale
invasion of Iran, starting what would become the eight-year-long IranâIraq
War (September 1980 - August 1988). A combination of fierce resistance by
Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi
advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the
invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing
Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his
leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce,
instead demanding reparation and toppling of Saddam Hussein from
power.[83][84][85]

Although Iran's population and economy were three times the size of Iraq's,
that country was aided by Western and Soviet countries with whatever help it
needed against Iran. Outside powers supplied arms to both sides during the
war, but the West wanted to be sure the Islamic revolution did not spread to
Iran's smaller oil-exporting neighbors in the oil rich Persian Gulf.

The war continued for another six years, its costs mounting. 1988 saw deadly
month-long Iraqi missile attacks on Tehran, mounting economic problems, the
demoralization of Iranian troops, attacks by the American Navy on Iranian
ships and oil rigs in the Persian Gulf, and the recapture by Iraq of the Faw
penninsula. In July of that year, Khomeini, in his words, "drank the cup of
poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Despite the high
cost of the war - 450,000 to 950,000 Iranian casualties and USD $300
billion[86] \- Khomeini insisted that the pursuit of overthrow of Saddam had
not been a mistake. In a 'Letter to Clergy' he wrote: '... we do not repent,
nor are we sorry for even a single moment for our performance during the war.
Have we forgotten that we fought to fulfill our religious duty and that the
result is a marginal issue?'[87]

### [edit] Rushdie fatwa

Main article: The Satanic Verses controversy

In early 1989, Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the assassination of Salman
Rushdie, an India-born British author. Khomeini claimed that Rushdie's
assassination was a religious duty for Muslims because of his alleged
blasphemy against Muhammad in his novel, The Satanic Verses, published in
1988. Rushdie's book contains passages that many Muslims â including
Ayatollah Khomeini â considered offensive to Islam and the prophet, but the
fatwa has also been attacked for violating the rules of fiqh by not allowing
the accused an opportunity to defend himself, and because "even the most
rigorous and extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill
anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence."[88]

Though Rushdie publicly apologized, the fatwa was not revoked. Khomeini
explained,

> Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time,
it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has got, his life and
wealth, to send him to Hell. [89]

Rushdie himself was not killed but Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator
of the book The Satanic Verses, was murdered and two other translators of the
book survived attempted assassinations. [90]

In a speech given to a huge crowd after returning to Iran from exile February
1, 1979, Khomeini made a variety of promises to Iranians for his coming
Islamic regime: A popularly elected government that would represent the people
of Iran and with which the clergy would not interfere. He promised that "no
one should remain homeless in this country," and that Iranians would have free
telephone, heating, electricity, bus services and free oil at their doorstep.
While many changes came to Iran under Khomeini, these promises have yet to be
fulfilled in the Islamic Republic.[citation needed][91]

Under Khomeini's rule, Sharia (Islamic law) was introduced, with the Islamic
dress code enforced for both men and women by Islamic Revolutionary Guards and
other Islamic groups[92] Women were required to cover their hair, and men were
not allowed to wear shorts. Alcoholic drinks, most Western movies, the
practice of men and women swimming or sunbathing together were banned.[93] The
Iranian educational curriculum was Islamized at all levels with the Islamic
Cultural Revolution; the "Committee for Islamization of Universities"[94]
carried this out thoroughly. The broadcasting of any music other than martial
or religious on Iranian radio and television was banned by Khomeini on July
1979.[95] The ban lasted 10 years (approximately the rest of his life). [96]

### [edit] Emigration and economy

Khomeini is said to have stressed "the spiritual over the material".[97] [98]
Six months after his first speech he expressed exasperation with complaints
about the sharp drop in Iran's standard of living: 'I cannot believe that the
purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons' [99] On
another occasion emphasizing the importance of martyrdom over material
prosperity: "Could anyone wish his child to be martyred to obtain a good
house? This is not the issue. The issue is another world." [100] He is also
reportedly famous for answering a question about his economic policies by
declaring that 'economics is for donkeys'.[101] This low opinion of economics
is said to be "one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian
economy since the revolution."[97] Another factor was the long war with Iraq,
whose cost led to government debt and inflation, eroding personal incomes, and
unprecedented unemployment.[102]

While Iran became more strict Islamically under Khomeini, absolute poverty
rose by nearly 45% during the first 6 years of his rule. [103] Emigration from
Iran also developed, reportedly for the first time that country's
history.[104] Since the revolution, an estimated "two to four million
entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their
capital)" have emigrated to other countries. [105] [106]

### [edit] Suppression of enemies and opposition

Opposition to the religious rule of the clergy or Islamic government in
general was often met with harsh punishments. In a talk at the Fayzieah School
in Qom, August 30, 1979, Khomeini warned opponents: "Those who are trying to
bring corruption and destruction to our country in the name of democracy will
be oppressed. They are worse than Bani-Ghorizeh Jews, and they must be hanged.
We will oppress them by God's order and God's call to prayer."[107]

The Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his family left Iran and escaped harm, but
hundreds of former members of the overthrown monarchy and military met their
end in firing squads, with critics complaining of "secrecy, vagueness of the
charges, the absence of defense lawyers or juries", or the opportunity of the
accused "to defend themselves." [108] In later years these were followed in
larger numbers by the erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini's movement --
Marxists and socialists, mostly university students -- who opposed the
theocratic regime. [109]

In the 1988 massacre of Iranian prisoners, following the People's Mujahedin of
Iran operation Forough-e Javidan against the Islamic Republic, Khomeini issued
an order to judicial officials to judge every Iranian political prisoner and
kill those who would not repent anti-regime activities. Estimates of the
number executed vary from 1,400 [110] to 30,000.[111][112][113]

Although many hoped the revolution would bring freedom of speech and press,
this was not to be. In defending forced closing of opposition newspapers and
attacks on opposition protesters by club-wielding vigilantes, Khomeini
explained, 'The club of the pen and the club of the tongue is the worst of
clubs, whose corruption is a 100 times greater than other clubs.'[114]

### [edit] Minority religions

Life for religious minorities was mixed under Khomeini. Non-Muslim religious
minorities no longer had equal rights. Senior government posts are reserved
for Muslims. Schools set up by Jewish, Christian and Zoroastrians must be run
by Muslim principals.[115] Compensation for death paid to the family of a non-
Muslim was (by law) less than if the victim was a Muslim. Conversion to Islam
is encouraged by entitling converts to inherit the entire share of their
parents (or even uncle's) estate if their siblings (or cousins) remain non-
Muslim.[116] Iran's non-Muslim population has fallen dramatically. For
example, the Jewish population in Iran dropped from 80,000 to 30,000 in the
first two decades of the revolution.[117]

However, four of the 270 seats in parliament are reserved for three non-
Islamic minority religions, under the Islamic constitution that Khomeini
oversaw. Khomeini also has called for unity between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims
(Sunni Muslims are the largest religious minority in Iran).[118]

Prerevolutionary statements by Khomeini had been antagonistic towards Jews,
but shortly after his return from exile in 1979, he issued a fatwa ordering
that Jews and other minorities (except Baha'is) be treated well. [119] [120]
In power, Khomeini distinguished between Zionism as a secular political party
that employs Jewish symbols and ideals and Judaism as the religion of
Moses.[121]

Unlike the other non-Muslims in Iran, the 300,000 members of the BahÃ¡'Ã­
Faith, were actively harassed. "Some 200 of whom have been executed and the
rest forced to convert or subjected to the most horrendous disabilities."
[122] Starting in late 1979 the new government systematically targeted the
leadership of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community by focusing on the BahÃ¡'Ã­ National
Spiritual Assembly (NSA) and Local Spiritual Assemblies (LSAs); prominent
members of NSAs and LSAs were either killed or disappeared.[123]

Like most conservative Muslims, Khomeini believed BahÃ¡'Ã­ to be apostates,
[124]

He claimed they were a political rather than a religious movement,[125][126]
declaring:

> the Baha'is are not a sect but a party, which was previously supported by
Britain and now the United States. The Baha'is are also spies just like the
Tudeh [Communist Party]. [127]

## [edit] Death and funeral

After eleven days in a hospital for an operation to stop internal bleeding,
Khomeini died of a heart attack on Saturday, June 3, 1989, at the age of 86.
[128] Iranians poured out into the cities and streets to mourn Khomeini's
death in a "completely spontaneous and unorchestrated outpouring of grief."
[129]

> Despite the hundred-degree heat, crushing mobs created an impassable sea of
black for miles as they wailed, chanted and rhythmically beat themselves in
anguish ... As the hours passed, fire trucks had to be brought in to spray
water on the crowd to provide relief from the heat, while helicopters were
flown in to ferry the eight killed and more than four hundred injured ...
[130]

Two million people attended his funeral[131]. Iranian officials aborted
Khomeiniâs first funeral, after a large crowd stormed the funeral
procession, nearly destroying Khomeini's wooden coffin in order to get a last
glimpse of his body. At one point, Khomeini's body actually almost fell to the
ground, as the crowd attempted to grab pieces of the death shroud. The second
funeral was held under much tighter security. Khomeini's casket was made of
steel, and heavily armed security personnel surrounded it. In accordance with
Islamic tradition, the casket was only to carry the body to the burial site.
Khomeini's grave is now housed within a larger mausoleum complex.

### [edit] Successorship

Grand Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri, a major figure of the Revolution, was
designated by Khomeini to be his successor as Supreme Leader. The principle of
velayat-e faqih and the Islamic constitution called for the Supreme Ruler to
be a marja or grand ayatollah, and of the dozen or so grand ayatollahs living
in 1981 only Montazeri accepted the concept of rule by Islamic
jurist.[132][unreliable source?] In 1989 Montazeri began to call for
liberalization, freedom for political parties. Following the execution of
thousands of political prisoners by the Islamic government, Montazeri told
Khomeini 'your prisons are far worse than those of the Shah and his
SAVAK.'[133] After a letter of his complaints was leaked to Europe and
broadcast on the BBC, a furious Khomeini ousted him from his position as
official successor.

Writers in the West report that the amendment made to Iran's constitution
removing the requirement that the Supreme Leader to be a Marja, was to deal
with the problem of a lack of any remaining Grand Ayatollahs willing to accept
"velayat-e faqih."[134][135][136] However, others say the reason marjas were
not elected was because of their lack of votes in the Assembly of Experts, for
example Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Golpaygani had the backing of only 13
members of the assembly. Furthermore, there were other marjas present who
accepted "velayat-e faqih"[137][138][139] Grand Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri
continued his criticism of the regime and in 1997 was put under house arrest
for questioning the unaccountable rule exercised by the supreme
leader.[140][141][142] He was released in 2003.

## [edit] Political thought and legacy

Wikisource has original text related to this article:

Author:Ruhollah Khomeini

Throughout his many writings and speeches, Khomeini's views on governance
evolved. Originally declaring rule by monarchs or others permissible so long
as sharia law was followed [143] Khomeini later adamantly opposed monarchy,
arguing that only rule by a leading Islamic jurist (a marja'), would insure
Sharia was properly followed (wilayat al-faqih), [144] before finally
insisting the ruling jurist need not be a leading one and Sharia rule could be
overruled by that jurist if necessary to serve the interests of Islam and the
"divine government" of the Islamic state. [145][unreliable source?]

Khomeini's concept of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists (ÙÙØ§ÛØª
ÙÙÛÙ, velayat-e faqih) did not win the support of the leading Iranian
Shi'i clergy of the time.[146][unreliable source?] Towards the 1979
Revolution, many clerics gradually became disillusioned with the rule of the
Shah, although none came around to supporting Khomeini's vision of a
theocratic Islamic Republic.[146]

Whether Khomeini's ideas are compatible with democracy and whether he intended
the Islamic Republic to be a democratic republic is disputed. According to the
state-run Aftab News, [147] both ultraconservative (Mohammad Taghi Mesbah
Yazdi) and reformist opponents of the regime (Akbar Ganji and Abdolkarim
Soroush) believe he did not, while regime officials and supporters like Ali
Khamenei[148], Mohammad Khatami and Mortaza Motahhari[149] believe Khomeini
intended the Islamic republic to be democratic and that it is so.[150]
Khomeini himself also made statements at different times indicating both
support and opposition to democracy.[151]

One scholar, Shaul Bakhash, explains this disagreement as coming from
Khomeini's belief that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah
demonstrations during the revolution constituted a 'referendum' in favor of an
Islamic republic.[152] Khomeini also wrote that since Muslims must support a
government based on Islamic law, Sharia-based government will always have more
popular support in Muslim countries than any government based on elected
representatives.[153]

Khomeini offered himself as a "champion of Islamic revival" and unity,
emphasizing issues Muslims agreed upon - the fight against Zionism and
imperialism - and downplaying Shia issues that would divide Shia from
Sunni.[154] Khomeini strongly opposed close relations with neither Eastern or
Western Bloc nations, believing the Islamic world should be its own bloc, or
rather converge into a single unified power.[155] He viewed Western culture as
being inherently decadent and a corrupting influence upon the youth. The
Islamic Republic banned or discouraged popular Western fashions, music,
cinema, and literature.[156] In the Western world it is said "his glowering
visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture" and
"inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam,"[157] making the word `Ayatollah`
"a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance."[158] This has
particularly been the case in the United States where some Iranians complained
that even at universities they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity
for fear of physical attack. [159] There Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are
remembered for the American embassy hostage taking and accused of sponsoring
hostage-taking and terrorist attacks,[160][161] and which continues to apply
economic sanctions against Iran.

Before taking power Khomeini expressed support for the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. "We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence."[162]
However once in power Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning
opponents of theocracy for example: "I repeat for the last time: abstain from
holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will
break your teeth."[163]

Many of Khomeini's political and religious ideas were considered to be
progressive and reformist by leftist intellectuals and activists prior to the
Revolution. However, once in power his ideas often clashed with those of
modernist or secular Iranian intellectuals. This conflict came to a head
during the writing of the Islamic constitution when many newspapers were
closed by the government. Khomeini angrily told the intellectuals:

> Yes, we are reactionaries, and you are enlightened intellectuals: You
intellectuals do not want us to go back 1400 years. You, who want freedom,
freedom for everything, the freedom of parties, you who want all the freedoms,
you intellectuals: freedom that will corrupt our youth, freedom that will pave
the way for the oppressor, freedom that will drag our nation to the bottom.
[164]

In contrast to his alienation from Iranian intellectuals, and "in an utter
departure from all other Islamist movements," Khomeini embraced international
revolution and Third World solidarity, giving it "precedence over Muslim
fraternity. From the time Khomeini's supporters gained control of the media
until his death, the Iranian media "devoted extensive coverage to non-Muslim
revolutionary movements (from the Sandinistas to the African National Congress
and the Irish Republican Army) and downplayed the role of the Islamic
movements considered conservative, such as the Afghan mujahidin."[165]

Khomeini's legacy to the economy of the Islamic Republic has been concern for
the mustazafin, but not always results. During the 1990s the mustazafin and
disabled war veterans rioted on several occasions, protesting the demolition
of their shantytowns and rising food prices, etc.[166][unreliable source?]
Khomeini's distain for the science of economics ("economics is for donkeys")
is said to have been "mirrored" by the populist redistribution policies of
Iran's current president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who allegedly wears "his
contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour", and has overseen
sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment.[167]

### [edit] Famous controversial fatawa (Legal rulings)

Although homosexual relationships are illegal (punishable by death) in Iran,
sex reassignment operations are permitted. In 1983, spiritual leader Ayatollah
Khomeini passed a fatwa allowing sex-change operations as a cure for
"diagnosed transsexuals".

## [edit] Appearance and habits

Khomeini was described as "slim," but athletic and "heavily boned." He was
known for his punctuality:

> He's so punctual that if he doesn't turn up for lunch at exactly ten past
everyone will get worried, because his work is regulated in such a way that he
turned up for lunch at exactly that time every day. He goes to bed exactly on
time. He eats exactly on time. And he wakes up exactly on time. He changes his
frock every time he comes back from the mosque. [168]

Khomeini was also known for his aloofness and stern demeanor. He is said to
have had "variously inspired admiration, awe, and fear from those around
him."[169] His practice of moving "through the halls of the madresehs never
smiling at anybody or anything. ... his practice of ignoring his audience
while he thought, contributed to his charisma." [170]

Khomeini adhered to traditional beliefs of Islamic cleanliness holding that
non-Moslems - like urine, excrement, blood, wine, sweat, etc. - were one of
eleven impure things contact with which required major ritual washing or Ghusl
before prayer or salah.[171][172] He is reported to have refused to eat or
drink in a restaurant unless he knew for sure the waiter was a Muslim.[173]

## [edit] Mystique

Even more famous was his mystique. He benefited from the widespread
circulation of "an old Shia saying" attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kazim who
is said to have prophesied shortly before his death in 799 that

> 'A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path.
There will rally to him people resembling pieces of iron, not to be shaken by
violent winds, unsparing and relying on God.' [174]

Khomeini was the first and only Iranian cleric to be addressed as "Imam", a
title hitherto reserved in Iran for the twelve infallible leaders of the early
Shi'a.[175] He was also associated with the Mahdi or 12th Imam of Shia belief
in a number of ways. One of his titles was Na'eb-e Imam (Deputy to the
[Twelfth Imam). His enemies were often attacked as taghut and mofsidin
fi'l-arz (corrupters of the earth), religious terms used for enemies of the
Twelfth Imam. Many of the officials of the overthrown Shah's government
executed by Revolutionary Courts were convicted of "fighting against the
Twelfth Imam". When a deputy in the majlis asked Khomeini if he was the
'promised Mahdi', Khomeini did not answer, "astutely" neither confirming nor
denying the title.[176]

Before the revolution, in late 1978, a rumour swept the country that
Khomeini's face could be seen in the full moon.

> Tears of joy were shed and huge quantities of sweets and fruits were
consumed as millions of people jumped for joy, shouting 'I've seen the Imam in
the moon.' The event was celebrated in thousands of mosques with mullahs
reminding the faithful that a sure sign of the coming of the Mahdi was that
the sun would rise in the West. Khomeini, representing the sun, was now in
France and his face was shining in the moon like a sun. People were ready to
swear on the Qur'an that they had seen Khomeini's face in the moon. Even the
Tudeh Party [the party of "Scientific Socialism"] shared in the [enthusiasm].
Its paper Navid wrote: 'Our toiling masses, fighting against world-devouring
imperialism headed by the blood-sucking United States, have seen the face of
their beloved Imam and leader, Khomeini the Breaker of Idols, in the moon. A
few pipsqueaks cannot deny what a whole nation has seen with its own eyes.'
[177]

As the revolution gained momentum, even some non-supporters exhibited awe,
called him "magnificently clear-minded, single-minded and unswerving."[178]
His image was as "absolute, wise, and indispensable leader of the nation"[179]

> The Imam, it was generally believed, had shown by his uncanny sweep to
power, that he knew how to act in ways which others could not begin to
understand. His timing was extraordinary, and his insight into the motivation
of others, those around him as well as his enemies, could not be explained as
ordinary knowledge. This emergent belief in Khomeini as a divinely guided
figure was carefully fostered by the clerics who supported him and spoke up
for him in front of the people. [180]

Even many secularists who firmly disapproved of his policies were said to feel
the power of his "messianic" appeal.[181] Comparing him to a father figure who
retains the enduring loyalty even of children he disapproves of, journalist
Afshin Molavi writes of the defenses of Khomeini he's "heard in the most
unlikely settings":

> A whiskey-drinking professor told an American journalist that Khomeini
brought pride back to Iranians. A women's rights activist told me that
Khomeini was not the problem; it was his conservative allies who had directed
him wrongly. A nationalist war veteran, who held Iran's ruling clerics in
contempt, carried with him a picture of 'the Imam'. [182]

Another journalist tells the story of an Iranian, who following bitter
criticism of the regime in which he tells her he wants his son to leave the
country and "repeatedly made the point that life had been better" under the
Shah, turns "ashen faced" and speechless upon hearing the 85+-year-old Imam
might be dying, pronouncing 'this is terrible for my country.'[183]

## [edit] Family and descendants

<IMG>

Khomeini with grandson Husain Khomeini and granddaughter Zahra Eshraghi.

In 1929, (some say 1931[184]) Khomeini married Batoul Saqafi Khomeini, the
[184] daughter of a cleric in Tehran. By all accounts their marriage was
harmonious and happy.[184] She died in 2009.[185] They had seven children,
though only five survived infancy. His daughters all married into either
merchant or clerical families, and both his sons entered into religious life.
The elder son, Mustafa, is rumored[citation needed] to have been murdered in
1977 while in exile with his father in Najaf, Iraq and Khomeini accused SAVAK
of orchestrating it[citation needed].

Khomeini's notable grandchildren include:

  * Zahra Eshraghi, granddaughter, married to Mohammad Reza Khatami, head of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the main reformist party in the country, and is considered a pro-reform character herself.

  * Hassan Khomeini, Khomeini's elder grandson Sayid Hasan Khomeini, son of the Seyyed Ahmad Khomeini, is a cleric and the trustee of Khomeini's shrine.

  * Husain Khomeini, (Sayid Husain Khomeini) Khomeini's other grandson, son of Sayid Mustafa Khomeini, is a mid-level cleric who is strongly against the system of the Islamic Republic. In 2003 he was quoted as saying:

    Iranians need freedom now, and if they can only achieve it with American interference I think they would welcome it. As an Iranian, I would welcome it. [186] In that same year Husain Khomeini visited the United States, where he met figures such as Reza Pahlavi II, the son of the last Shah. Later that year, Husain returned to Iran after receiving an urgent message from his grandmother. According to Michael Ledeen, quoting "family sources", he was blackmailed into returning.[187] In 2006, he called for an American invasion and overthrow of the Islamic Republic, telling Al-Arabiyah television station viewers, "If you were a prisoner, what would you do? I want someone to break the prison [doors open]."[188]. Another of Khomeini's grandchildren, Ali Eshraghi, was disqualified from the 2008 parliamentary elections on grounds of being insufficiently loyal to the principles of the Islamic revolution, but later reinstated.[189]
## [edit] Works

Khomeini was an prolific writer (200 of his books are online[190]) who
authored commentaries on the Qur'an,on Islamic jurisprudence, the roots of
Islamic law, and Islamic traditions. He also released books about philosophy,
gnosticism, poetry, literature, government and politics.[191] Some of his
books:

  * Wilayat al-Faqih
  * Forty Hadith (Forty Traditions)
  * Adab as Salat (The Disciplines of Prayers)
  * Jihade Akbar (The Greater Struggle)
