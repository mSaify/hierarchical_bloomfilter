## [edit] Creation of the reactor

Hahn, nicknamed the "Radioactive Boy Scout", is an Eagle Scout who got a merit
badge in Atomic Energy and spent years tinkering with basement chemistry which
sometimes resulted in small explosions and other mishaps. He was inspired in
part by reading The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments, and tried to collect
samples of every element in the periodic table, including the radioactive
ones. Hahn diligently amassed this radioactive material by collecting small
amounts from household products, such as americium from smoke detectors,
thorium from camping lantern mantles, radium from clocks and tritium (as
neutron moderator) from gunsights. His "reactor" was a large, bored-out block
of lead, and he used lithium from $1,000 worth of stolen batteries to purify
the thorium ash using a Bunsen burner.[1]

Hahn posed as an adult scientist or professor to gain the trust of many
professionals in letters, despite the presence of misspellings and obvious
errors in his letters to them. Hahn ultimately hoped to create a breeder
reactor, using low-level isotopes to transform samples of thorium and uranium
into fissionable isotopes.

Although his homemade reactor never achieved critical mass, it ended up
emitting dangerous levels of radioactivity, likely well over 1,000 times
normal background radiation. Alarmed, Hahn began to dismantle his experiments,
but a chance encounter with police led to the discovery of his activities,
which triggered a Federal Radiological Emergency Response involving the FBI
and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency, having designated Hahn's mother's property as a Superfund
hazardous materials cleanup site, dismantled the shed and its contents and
buried them as low-level radioactive waste in Utah. Hahn refused medical
evaluation for radiation exposure.

## [edit] Career

Hahn suffered local shame, but did attain the rank of Eagle Scout. After
dropping out of community college, Hahn joined the Navy, assigned to the
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise as an ordinary seaman.

Hahn had hoped to pursue a nuclear specialist career, but was not even
permitted to tour the reactors.[citation needed] EPA scientists believe that
Hahn may have exceeded the lifetime dosage for thorium exposure, but he
refused their recommendation that he be examined at the Enrico Fermi Nuclear
Generating Station.[2]. Later, Hahn re-enlisted as a Marine.

## [edit] Media coverage

The incident received scant media attention at the time, but was widely
disseminated after writer Ken Silverstein published an article about the
incident in Harper's Magazine in 1998[2]. In 2004 he expanded it into a book,
The Radioactive Boy Scout.

A television documentary, The Nuclear Boyscout[1], aired on Channel 4 in the
United Kingdom in 2003. In it, Hahn reenacted some of his methods for the
camera. Though slated to air on the Discovery Channel, the program has not yet
been broadcast in the United States.

## [edit] 2007 arrest

On August 1, 2007, Hahn was arrested in Clinton Township, Michigan for
larceny, in relation to a matter involving several smoke detectors, allegedly
removed from the halls of his apartment building. In his mug shot, his face is
covered with sores which investigators claim are possibly from exposure to
radioactive materials.[3] During a Circuit Court hearing, Hahn pleaded guilty
to attempted larceny of a building. The courtâs online docket said
prosecutors recommended that he be sentenced to time served and enter an
inpatient treatment facility. Under terms of the plea, the original charge of
larceny of a building would be dismissed at sentencing, scheduled for Oct.
4.[4] He was sentenced to 90 days in jail for attempted larceny. Court records
state that his sentence will be delayed by six months while Hahn undergoes
treatment for radiation exposure.[5]

## [edit] In Popular Culture

In the CSI:NY episode Page Turner the character Lawrence Wagner is based on
David Hahn.

A movie titled "The Radioactive Boy Scout"[6] has been announced, based on the
book by Ken Silverstein.
