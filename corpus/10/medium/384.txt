## [edit] Biography

### [edit] Personal

Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York to James Donald Wallace and Sally Foster
Wallace. In his early childhood, Wallace lived in Champaign, Illinois. In
fourth grade, he moved to Urbana and attended Yankee Ridge school. As an
adolescent, Wallace was a regionally ranked junior tennis player.

He attended his father's alma mater, Amherst College, and majored in English
and philosophy, with a focus on modal logic and mathematics. His philosophy
senior thesis on modal logic, titled Richard Taylor's 'Fatalism' and the
Semantics of Physical Modality (described in James Ryerson's 2008 New York
Times essay "Consider the Philosopher"[4]) was awarded the Gail Kennedy
Memorial Prize.[5] His other senior thesis, in English, would later become his
first novel.[6] Wallace graduated with summa cum laude honors for both theses
in 1985, and in 1987 received a Master of Fine Arts in creative writing from
the University of Arizona.

### [edit] Family

His father, James Wallace, having finished his graduate course work in
philosophy at Cornell University, accepted a teaching job at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the fall of 1962. He received his Ph.D. from
Cornell in 1963. His mother, Sally Foster Wallace, attended graduate school in
English Composition at the University of Illinois and became a professor of
English at Parkland College â a community college in Champaign â where she
won a national Professor of the Year award in 1996. His younger sister, Amy
Wallace Havens of Tucson, Arizona, has practiced law since 2005. Wallace
married painter Karen L. Green on December 27, 2004.[7][8] He had a close
relationship with their two dogs, Bella and Warner.[8]

### [edit] Death

Wallace committed suicide on September 12, 2008,[1][2][7][9] as confirmed by
the October 27, 2008 autopsy report.[10]

In an interview with The New York Times, Wallace's father reported that
Wallace had suffered from depression for more than 20 years and that
antidepressant medication had allowed him to be productive.[7] When he
experienced severe side effects from the medication, Wallace attempted to wean
himself from his primary antidepressant, Nardil.[8] On his doctor's advice,
Wallace stopped taking the medication in June 2007,[7] and the depression
returned. Wallace received other treatments including electroconvulsive
therapy. When he returned to Nardil, he found it had lost its
effectiveness.[8] In the months before his death, his depression became
severe.[7]

Numerous gatherings were held to honor Wallace after his death, including
memorial services at Pomona College, Amherst College, and on October 23, 2008,
at NYU â the latter with speakers including his sister, Amy Wallace Havens;
his agent, Bonnie Nadell; Gerry Howard, the editor of his first two books;
Colin Harrison, editor at Harper's Magazine; Michael Pietsch, the editor of
Infinite Jest and Wallace's later work; Deborah Treisman, fiction editor at
The New Yorker; as well as authors Don DeLillo, Zadie Smith, George Saunders,
Mark Costello, Donald Antrim, and Jonathan Franzen.[11]

### [edit] Career

David Foster Wallace giving a reading for Booksmith at All Saints Church in
2006 in San Francisco.

Wallace's first novel, The Broom of the System, garnered national attention
and critical praise. Caryn James of The New York Times called it a successful
"manic, human, flawed extravaganza", "emerging straight from the excessive
tradition of Stanley Elkin's Franchiser, Thomas Pynchon's V, John Irving's
World According to Garp."[12] Wallace moved to Boston, Massachusetts to pursue
graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard University, only later to abandon
those same studies. In 1991 he began teaching literature as an adjunct
professor at Emerson College in Boston.

In 1992, at the behest of colleague and supporter Steven Moore, Wallace
applied for and won a position in the English department at Illinois State
University. He had begun work on his second novel, Infinite Jest, in 1991, and
submitted a draft to his editor in December 1993. After the publication of
excerpts throughout 1995, the book was published in 1996.

Wallace published short fiction in Might, GQ, Playboy, The Paris Review,
Harper's Magazine, Conjunctions, Esquire, Open City, Timothy McSweeney's
Quarterly Concern, The New Yorker, and Science.

Wallace received the MacArthur Foundation "Genius Grant" in 1997. In 1997,
Wallace was awarded the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction by editors of The Paris
Review for one of the stories in Brief Interviews â "Brief Interviews with
Hideous Men #6" â which had appeared in the magazine.

In 2002, he moved to Claremont, California, to become the first Roy E. Disney
Professor of Creative Writing and Professor of English at Pomona College. He
taught one or two undergraduate courses per semester, and focused on his
writing.

Bonnie Nardell was Wallace's literary agent during his entire career.[13]
Michael Pietsch was his editor on Infinite Jest.[14]

In March 2009, Little, Brown and Company announced that it would publish the
manuscript of an unfinished novel, entitled The Pale King, that Wallace was
working on at the time of his death.[15] An excerpt from the novel was
published in the March 9, 2009 issue of The New Yorker.[16][17]

### [edit] Themes and styles

Wallace's fiction is often concerned with irony. His essay "E Unibus Pluram:
Television and U.S. Fiction",[18] originally published in the small-
circulation Review of Contemporary Fiction in 1993, proposes that television
has an ironic influence on fiction writing, and urges literary authors to
eschew irony. Wallace used many forms of irony, focusing on individuals'
continued longing for earnest, unself-conscious experience, and communication
in a media-saturated society.[19]

Wallace's novels often combine various writing modes or voices, and
incorporate jargon and vocabulary (sometimes invented) from a wide variety of
fields. His writing featured self-generated abbreviations and acronyms, long
multi-clause sentences, and a notable use of explanatory footnotes and
endnotes â often nearly as expansive as the text proper. He used endnotes
extensively in Infinite Jest and footnotes in "Octet" as well as in the great
majority of his nonfiction after 1996. On the Charlie Rose show in 1997,
Wallace claimed that the notes were used to disrupt the linearity of the
narrative, to reflect his perception of reality without jumbling the entire
structure. He suggested that he could have instead jumbled up the sentences,
"but then no one would read it."[20]

### [edit] Nonfiction work

Wallace covered Senator John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign[21] and the
September 11 attacks for Rolling Stone; cruise ships (the humorous title essay
for his first nonfiction book), state fairs, and tornadoes for Harper's
Magazine; the U.S. Open tournament for Tennis magazine; the director David
Lynch and the pornography industry for Premiere magazine; the special-effects
film industry for Waterstone's magazine; conservative talk radio host John
Ziegler for The Atlantic Monthly;[22] and a Maine lobster festival for Gourmet
magazine. He also reviewed books in several genres for the Los Angeles Times,
The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Philadelphia Inquirer. In the
November 2007 issue of The Atlantic, which commemorated the magazine's 150th
anniversary, Wallace was among the authors, artists, politicians and others
who wrote short pieces on "the future of the American idea".

### [edit] Other media

In 2006, John Krasinski began directing a filmed adaption of Brief Interviews
With Hideous Men, starring Julianne Nicholson and a long list of well-known
character actors including Christopher Meloni, Rashida Jones, Timothy Hutton,
Josh Charles and Will Forte.[23] The film premiered at the Sundance Film
Festival in January 2009.[24]
