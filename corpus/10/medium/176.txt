Laurence Wilfred "Laurie" Baker (March 2, 1917 â April 1, 2007) was an
award-winning British-born Indian architect, renowned for his initiatives in
cost-effective energy-efficient architecture and for his unique space
utilisation and simple but beautful aesthetic sensibility. In time he made a
name for himself both in sustainable architecture as well as in organic
architecture.

He went to India in 1945 in part as a missionary and since then lived and
worked in India for over 50 years. He obtained Indian citizenship in 1989 and
resided in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kerala, since 1970 , where he
later set up an organization called COSTFORD (Centre of Science and Technology
for Rural Development), for spreading awareness for low cost housing.

In 1990, the Government of India awarded him with the Padma Shri in
recognition of his meritorious service in the field of architecture.

## [edit] Education and missionary work

Baker was born into a staunch Methodist family, the youngest son of Birmingham
Gas Distribution Authority's chief accountant, Wilfred Baker and Emiley [1].
His elder brothers, Leonard and Norman, were both studying law, and had a
married sister, Edna. In his teens Baker began to question what religion meant
to him and decided to become a Quaker since it was closer to what he believed
in. Baker studied architecture at Birmingham Institute of Art and Design,
Birmingham and graduated in 1937, aged 20, in a period of political unrest for
Europe.

During the Second World War, he served in the Friends Ambulance Unit in China
and Burma.[2]

His initial commitment to India had him working as an architect for World
Leprosy Mission, an international and interdenominational Mission dedicated to
the care of those suffering from leprosy in 1945 [3]. As new medicines for the
treatment of the disease were becoming more prevalent, his responsibilities
were focused on converting or replacing asylums once used to house the
ostracized sufferers of the disease - "lepers". Finding his English
construction education to be inadequate for the types of issues and materials
he was faced with: termites and the yearly monsoon, as well as laterite, cow
dung, and mud walls, respectively, Baker had no choice but to observe and
learn from the methods and practices of the vernacular architecture. He soon
learned that the indigenous architecture and methods of these places were in
fact the only viable means to deal with his once daunting problems.

Inspired by his discoveries (which he modestly admitted were 'discoveries'
only for him, and mere common knowledge to those who developed the practices
he observed), he began to turn his style of architecture towards one that
respected the actual culture and needs of those who would actually use his
buildings, rather than just playing to the more "Modern-istic" tunes of his
paying clients.

## [edit] Gandhian encouragement and initial work

After he came to India Laurie had a chance encounter with Mahatma Gandhi which
was to have a lasting impact on his ideology and also his work and building
philosophy [4]. After India gained her independence and Mahatma Gandhi was
assassinated, Baker lived in Kerala with Doctor P.J. Chandy, from whom he
received great encouragement and whose sister he would later wed in 1948 [5].
Herself a doctor, Elizabeth Jacob and Laurie were married and moved to
Pithoragarh, a small village in Uttarakhand, where they lived and worked for
the next 16 years. Elizabeth's medical training was put to use aiding the
afflicted in the village while Laurie continued his architectural work and
research accommodating the medical needs of the community through his
constructions of various hospitals and clinics. It is here that Baker would
acquire and hone those skills from the local building community which had so
fascinated him during his missionary work. In 1966, Baker moved south and
worked with the tribals of Peerumed, Kerala, and in 1970 moved to
Thiruvananthapuram [6].

Baker sought to enrich the culture in which he participated by promoting
simplicity and home-grown quality in his buildings. Seeing so many people
living in poverty in the region and throughout India served also to amplify
his emphasis on cost-conscious construction, one that encouraged local
participation in development and craftsmanship - an ideal that the Mahatma
expressed as the only means to revitalize and liberate an impoverished India.
This drive for simplicity also stemmed from his Quaker faith, one that saw
indulging in a deceitful facade as a way to fool the 'Creator' as quite
pointless. Instead, Baker sought to provide the 'right' space for his clients
and to avoid anything pretentious.

Eventually, he was drawn back to work in India as more and more people began
commissioning work from him in the area. The first client being Welthy
Honsinger Fisher, an elderly American woman concerned with adult illiteracy
throughout India, who sought to set up a 'Literacy Village' in which she
intended to use puppetry, music and art as teaching methods to help illiterate
and newly-literate adults add to their skills[7].[8][9] An aging woman who
risked her health to visit Laurie, refused to leave until she received plans
for the village. More and more hospital commissions were received as medical
professionals realized that the surroundings for their patients were as much a
part of the healing process as any other form of treatment, and that Baker
seemed the only architect who cared enough to become familiarized with how to
build what made Indian patients comfortable with those surroundings. His
presence would also soon be required on-site at Ms. Fisher's "Village," and he
became well known for his constant presence on the construction sites of all
his projects, often finalizing designs through hand-drawn instructions to
masons and laborers on how to achieve certain design solutions.

## [edit] Architectural style

Throughout his practice, Baker became well known for designing and building
low cost, high quality, beautiful homes, with a great portion of his work
suited to or built for lower-middle to lower class clients. His buildings tend
to emphasize prolific - at times virtuosic - masonry construction, instilling
privacy and evoking history with brick jali walls, a perforated brick screen
which invites a natural air flow to cool the buildings' interior, in addition
to creating intricate patterns of light and shadow. Another significant Baker
feature is irregular, pyramid-like structures on roofs, with one side left
open and tilting into the wind. Baker's designs invariably have traditional
Indian sloping roofs and terracotta Mangalore tile shingling with gables and
vents allowing rising hot air to escape. Curved walls enter Baker's
architectural vocabulary as a means to enclose more volume at lower material
cost than straight walls, and for Laurie, "building [became] more fun with the
circle." A testament to his frugality, Baker was often seen rummaging through
salvage heaps looking for suitable building materials, door and window frames,
sometimes hitting a stroke of luck as evidenced by the intricately carved
entry to the Chitralekha Film Studio (Aakulam, Trivandrum, 1974-76): a
capricious architectural element found in a junk heap.

Baker's works, such as this house, blend seamlessly into the natural settings.

Baker's architectural method is one of improvisation, in which initial
drawings have only an idealistic link to the final construction, with most of
the accommodations and design choices being made on-site by the architect
himself. Compartments for milk bottles near the doorstep, windowsills that
double as bench surfaces, and a heavy emphasis on taking cues from the natural
condition of the site are just some examples. His Quaker-instilled respect for
nature lead him to let the idiosyncrasies of a site inform his architectural
improvisations, rarely is a topography line marred or a tree uprooted. This
saves construction cost as well, since working around difficult site
conditions is much more cost-effective than clear-cutting. ("I think it's a
waste of money to level a well-moulded site") Resistant to "high-technology"
that addresses building environment issues by ignoring natural environment, at
the Centre for Development Studies (Trivandrum, 1971) Baker created a cooling
system by placing a high, latticed, brick wall near a pond that uses air
pressure differences to draw cool air through the building. His responsiveness
to never-identical site conditions quite obviously allowed for the variegation
that permeates his work.

## [edit] Death

The Hamlet at Nalanchira near Thiruvananthapuram, which was home to Baker and
his wife since 1970. The house, which resides on a hill top, was constructed
by Baker.

Laurie Baker died at 7:30 am on April 1, 2007, aged 90, he was survived by
wife Elizabeth, son Tilak and daughters Vidya and Heidi. Until the end, he
continued to work in and around his home in Trivandrum, though health concerns
had kept his famous on-site physical presence to a minimum. His designing and
writing were done mostly at his home. His approach to architecture steadily
gained appreciation as architectural sentiment creaks towards place-making
over modernizing or stylizing. As a result of this more widespread acceptance,
however, the "Baker Style" home is gaining popularity, much to Baker's own
chagrin, since he felt that the 'style' being commoditised is merely the
inevitable manifestation of the cultural and economic imperatives of the
region in which he worked, not a solution that could be applied whole-cloth to
any outside situation. Laurie Baker's architecture focused on retaining a
site's natural character, and economically minded indigenous construction, and
the seamless integration of local culture that has been very inspirational.

Many of Laurie Baker's writings were published and are available through
COSTFORD (the Center Of Science and Technology For Rural Development) the
voluntary organisation which carried out many of his later projects, at which
he was the Master Architect. COSTFORD is carrying on working towards the
ideals that Laurie Baker espoused throughout his life.
