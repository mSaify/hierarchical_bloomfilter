## [edit] Early life and career

Izzard was born in Aden, Yemen, the youngest son of British parents Dorothy
Ella, a midwife and nurse, and Harold John Izzard, an accountant who was
working in Aden with British Petroleum.[3][4] A year after his birth, Izzard's
family moved to Bangor in North Wales and lived there until Eddie was five.
His mother died of cancer in March 1968, when Izzard was only 6 and his
brother Mark was 8. After an education at St Bede's Preparatory School and at
Eastbourne College, he began to toy with stand-up at the University of
Sheffield and, after being ingloriously kicked off his accountancy degree
course, he took his act into the streets. Having spent a great deal of the
1980s working as a street performer in Europe and the United States, Izzard
moved his act into the stand-up comedy venues of Britain, first appearing at
The Comedy Store in London in 1987. He refined his material throughout the
'80s, and in the early '90s he finally began earning some measure of
recognition, though not in the guise in which he would later become famous.

## [edit] Success as a comedian

His stand-up work brought him British Comedy Awards in 1993 (for Live at the
Ambassadors) and 1996 (for Definite Article). After the British leg of the
tour, he took Definite Article to major cities outside the UK including a
successful stint in New York City. However, his U.S. breakthrough did not
really come until 1999, when Dress to Kill was shown on the American
television channel HBO, about a year or so after he performed the show on tour
in the U.S., the U.K. and France (that same year, he played a supporting role
in the movie Mystery Men). Suddenly, America was aware of Izzard, and the show
went on to earn him two Emmy Awards in 2000 (for performance and writing).
However, he only rarely performs his stand-up act on television, as he says it
uses up material at too high a rate whereas stage material can be continually
re-used in front of different audiences for several months.

In 2005, Izzard provided the voiceover (again, in his unique 'rambling' style)
for the British government's series of television advertisements promoting
recycling. The tagline of the ads was "Recycle. The possibilities are
endless!"

In January 2006, the U.S. television network FX announced the production of a
new drama series co-written by Izzard called The Riches (formerly Low Life).
Izzard and British actress Minnie Driver star as a married couple, Wayne and
Dahlia Malloy, who have been part of a caravan of con-artist Irish travellers
swindling their way across the U.S. with their children. After finding another
family killed in a car accident, the Malloys assume their identities and start
a new life as law-abiding suburbanites in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The youngest
son has shown a preference for wearing girls' clothing, leading to some
speculation that the role was based upon Izzard's experiences. Izzard has
stated in several interviews that the character of Sam had been given
transvestite tendencies long before he was cast as Wayne Malloy, but he has
contributed his perspective to keep the character believable.

Izzard also performed with Scottish musician Midge Ure at Live8 in Edinburgh,
Scotland. He played the piano accompaniment for the song "Vienna".

## [edit] Theatrical appearances

In 1994, Izzard made his West End drama debut as the lead in the world
premiere of David Mamet's The Cryptogram with Lindsay Duncan, in the
production at London's Comedy Theatre. The success of that role led to his
second starring role in David Beaird's black comedy 900 Oneonta. In 1995, he
portrayed the title character in Christopher Marlowe's Edward II."

Izzard portrayed comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1999 production of Julian Barry's
1971 play Lenny. In 2001, he replaced Clive Owen in Peter Nichols' 1967 play A
Day in the Death of Joe Egg at the Comedy Theatre. Izzard and Victoria
Hamilton then repeated their lead roles when the show was brought to Broadway
in 2003, with The Roundabout Theatre Company production. The revival received
four Tony Award nominations including Best Revival of a Play, Best Leading
Actor and Actress for its stars Izzard and Hamilton in their Broadway debuts,
and Best Direction for Laurence Boswell.

## [edit] Comic style

Izzard's style is heavily influenced by Monty Python, especially in his use of
a stream-of-consciousness delivery that jumps between topics as he free
associates on stage. He does not generally work from a script, owing to his
dyslexia. Instead, he interrupts himself with new joke ideas, the characters
he portrays turn into other characters, and he nonchalantly leaps from
historical analysis to musings about household appliances. This often results
in brief pauses in the routine which he fills with 'so, yeah,' and other
verbal tics that have become his trademarks. Thinking aloud is also part of
Izzard's ongoing attempt to make the process of writing the show itself part
of the humour. As he put it in a 2004 interview with The Guardian, "It's the
oral tradition. Human beings have been doing it for thousands of years".[5] He
frequently notes the reaction to a joke midstream by miming writing on his
hand ("should be funnier" or "lost them there"), asks the audience questions,
and verbally engages with hecklers.

Among Izzard's comic talents are mimicry and mime. He portrays God as a
bumbling authority figure using the voice of James Mason, and John F. Kennedy
and Noah as Sean Connery, impersonations of whom appear in all of his
performances. Izzard also imitates activities such as sawing wood, vacuuming,
and mowing the lawn, anthropomorphizing the machines with accents and
personalities. Successful impressions, such as his Scottish clarinet teacher,
Mrs. Badcrumble, become running gags which recur in different shows. He
tackles topics both contemporary and historic, including frequent re-
imaginings of historical events which result in scenes like 'Cake or Death:
Church of England runs the Inquisition,' or 'Jesus Ministers to the
Dinosaurs.' When asked about his comedy style by George Stroumboulopoulos,
host of CBC Television's talk show, The Hour, Izzard described his use of
history by saying,

> "I just talk complete bullshit. The history, the politics, I noticed that no
one was using history, so there's a lot of history lying about the place, and
it's all free, and it's on Wikipedia! You know, I use Wikipedia like a crazy
idiot, now. Then I take all this stuff, and I regurgitate it into a weird
angle".[6]

In 2008, in his Stripped tour, Izzard began using Wikipedia itself as part of
his stand-up act, reading from a live copy of an article (via an iPhone) and
mocking Wikipedia's self-referential editorial style. To date, he has read
from a variety of different articles.

Although much of his humour deals with sensitive issues, with special emphasis
on religion, it has generally not been intended as mean-spirited or rude.
Izzard, however, took a different tone in 2008's "Stripped" tour. Professing
that he had learned he was an atheist, he explains that he doesn't like the
word "worship" because he doesn't see why anyone would want to worship someone
who had "fucked the whole thing up from the beginning." The show's theme was
an apologetic, humorous presentation on how one can see that there's no God.

Traditionally, Izzard has focused on the creative possibilities of thinking
through absurd situations in real time. He also turns much of the attention on
himself and his personality, including his cross-dressing ("it is my manifest
destiny to wear a dress on all seven continents"). Contemporary pop culture
(Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc.), is also a frequent subject, brought up both
to critique its weaknesses and to enhance his anecdotes.

His bent towards the surreal even went so far as to produce a sitcom called
Cows in 1997 for Channel 4, a live action comedy with actors dressed in
cowsuits.[7]

## [edit] Transvestism

<IMG>

Izzard describes himself as an "executive", "action", and "underground"
transvestite, as "a male tomboy" or "male lesbian" rather than a "weirdo"
transvestite (he cites J. Edgar Hoover as an example of the latter) or "drag
queen". He regularly cross-dresses both on and off stage and makes it clear
that cross-dressing is, for him, neither a part of his performance, nor a
sexual thing â he simply enjoys wearing make-up and clothing which is
traditionally perceived in the West as female-only. He remarks in one of his
shows, "Women wear what they want and so do I." According to Izzard, "Most
transvestites fancy women." He dismisses claims that he is a male homosexual,
saying he is either a straight transvestite or a "male lesbian". He has also
described himself as "a lesbian trapped in a man's body",[8] transgender, [9]
and "a complete boy plus half a girl."[10]

Often describing his "breast envy," Izzard, after shooting the film The
Avengers, occasionally wears a pair of false breasts, reputedly[citation
needed] modelled upon co-star Uma Thurman's own breasts. These had been
intended for Thurman's body double to use.

## [edit] Activism

Izzard has engaged in campaigning work. He is especially well-known as a pro-
European Union campaigner supporting the further integration of the UK into
the EU. In May 2005 he appeared on the BBC's political debate show Question
Time, describing himself as a 'British-European', comparing this with other
cultural identities such as 'African-American'. As part of his integration
campaigning, he was one of the first people to spend a euro in London. This
pan-European approach has influenced his work: he regularly performs in
French, an acquired language, and occasionally in German, in addition to
English.

In July 2003, Izzard received an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University
of East Anglia in Norwich, England for "pro-Europe campaigning", "his
contribution to promoting modern languages and tolerance of other cultures and
lifestyles" and for having "transcended national barriers" with his
humour.[11]

He has also campaigned unsuccessfully against the closure of the departments
of Drama and Languages, Linguistics and Translation at the University of East
Anglia.

He appeared in a 2005 party political broadcast for the UK Labour Party in the
run up to the 2005 general election. He donated nearly Â£10,000 to the party
in 2008.[12]

On 20 July 2006, he received an honorary doctorate in Letters from the Faculty
of Arts at the University of Sheffield,[13] where he spent one year on an
Accounting and Financial Management course in the early 80s. During his time
at the University he established the now-defunct Alternative Productions
Society in the Union of Students with the aim of promoting fringe-based arts.

On 7 July 2007, Izzard was one of the presenters from the London leg of Live
Earth.

During an interview for the 2008 Stripped tour, Izzard spoke about becoming
more active in European politics as well as running for political office in
Europe within the next decade.

During his 2008 Stripped tour, Izzard added a stop in New Orleans. All
proceeds from the June 23rd, 2008 performance were donated to Neighborhood
Housing Services of New Orleans.[14]

## [edit] Critical reception

On 18 March 2007, Izzard was listed as number 3 of the 100 Greatest Comedians
(just behind Peter Kay at number 2 and Billy Connolly at number 1) as part of
Channel 4's ongoing 100 Greatest... series.[15] In a 2005 poll to find The
Comedian's Comedian, Izzard was voted amongst the top 20 greatest comedy acts
ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. He was number 75 in Comedy
Central's 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. During the 1999 television
special It's... the Monty Python Story,[16] which Izzard hosted, John Cleese
said Izzard was the "Lost Python"; Izzard furthered that idea via his
substitution for Graham Chapman in public performance of Python material with
the rest of the original members of the troupe. In 2008, Izzard received the
James Joyce Award of the Literary and Historical Society.
