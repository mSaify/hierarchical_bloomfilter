Lawrence Henry "Larry" Summers (born November 30, 1954) is an American
economist and the Director of the White House's National Economic Council for
President Barack Obama.[1] Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University
Professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He is the 1993
recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal for his work in several fields of
economics and was Secretary of the Treasury for the last year and a half of
the Bill Clinton administration. Summers also served as the 27th President of
Harvard University from 2001 to 2006. Summers resigned as Harvard's president
in the wake of controversy over a talk in which he speculated that women may
statistically have lesser aptitude for work in the highest levels of math and
science. Summers has been criticized by some liberals for the centrist
economic policies he advocated as Treasury Secretary and in later writings.[2]

## [edit] Family and education

Born in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 30, 1954, Summers is the son of
two economists, Robert Summers and Anita Summers, who are both professors at
the University of Pennsylvania, as well as the nephew of two Nobel laureates
in economics: Paul Samuelson (sibling of Robert Summers, who, following an
older brother's example, changed the family name from Samuelson to Summers)
and Kenneth Arrow (Anita Summers's brother). He spent most of his childhood in
Penn Valley, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, where he attended
Harriton High School.

At age 16, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where
he originally intended to study physics but soon switched to economics due to
his strong interest in the matter (S.B., 1975). He was also an active member
of the MIT debating team. He attended Harvard University as a graduate student
(Ph.D., 1982), where he studied under conservative economist Martin Feldstein.
In 1983, at age 28, Summers became one of the youngest tenured professors in
Harvard's history. Summers has three children (older twin daughters Ruth and
Pamela and son Harry) by his first wife, Victoria Perry. In December 2005,
Summers married English professor Elisa New, who had three daughters from a
previous marriage. He currently owns two houses, one in D.C. and one in
Brookline, Massachusetts.

## [edit] Career

### [edit] Academic economist

As a researcher, Summers has made important contributions in many areas of
economics, primarily public finance, labor economics, financial economics, and
macroeconomics. Some of Summers' early papers concluded that corporate and
capital gains taxes are an inefficient form of taxation.[citation needed]
Cutting the capital gains tax rate, Summers found, could help the economy
grow.[citation needed] Later, while working in the Reagan and Clinton White
Houses, Summers was able to lobby successfully for cuts in both corporate and
capital gains taxes.[citation needed] One of Summers' prominent findings in
labor economics is that unemployment insurance and welfare payments are a
major contributor to unemployment, and therefore should be scaled back. [3]

Summers has also worked in international economics, economic demography,
economic history, and development economics. His work generally emphasizes the
analysis of empirical economic data in order to answer well-defined questions
(for example: Does saving respond to after-tax interest rates? Are the returns
from stocks and stock portfolios predictable?, Are most of those who receive
unemployment benefits only transitorily unemployed?, etc.) For his work he
received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1993 from the American Economic
Association. In 1987 he was the first social scientist to win the Alan T.
Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation. Summers is also a member
of the National Academy of Sciences.

Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury

### [edit] Public official

Summers was on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers under President
Reagan from 1982-1983. He also served as an economic adviser to the Dukakis
Presidential campaign in 1988.

### [edit] Chief Economist at the World Bank

Summers left Harvard in 1991 and served as Chief Economist for the World Bank
until 1993.

#### [edit] 'Dirty Industries'

Further information: Summers memo

In December 1991, while at the World Bank, Summers signed a memo written by
staff economist Lant Pritchett, which was leaked. The memo apparently argued
that free trade would not necessarily benefit the environment in developing
countries. An aside to the memo, leaked to the press, sarcastically suggested
that "I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the
lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that . . . I've
always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly
underpolluted." [4]

### [edit] Service in the Clinton administration

In 1993 Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs and
later in the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton
administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury
under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin
as Secretary of the Treasury.

Much of Summers's tenure at the Treasury Department was focused on
international economic issues. He was deeply involved in Clinton
administration's effort to bail out Mexico and Russia when those nations had
currency crises.[5] Summers forced the Korean government to raise its interest
rates and balance its budget in the midst of a recession, policies criticized
by liberal economists such as Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz.[6] According
to the book The Chastening, by Paul Blustein, during this crisis, Summers,
along with Paul Wolfowitz, pushed for regime change in Indonesia.[6]

As Treasury Secretary, Summers led the Clinton administration's opposition to
tax cuts proposed by the Republican Congress in 1999. [7] Also during his
stint in the Clinton administration, Summers was successful in pushing for
capital gains tax cuts.[citation needed] During the California energy crisis
of 2000, then-Treasury Secretary Summers teamed with Alan Greenspan and Enron
executive Kenneth Lay to lecture California Governor Gray Davis on the causes
of the crisis, explaining that the problem was excessive government
regulation.[8] Under the advice of Kenneth Lay, Summers urged Davis to relax
California's environmental standards in order to reassure the markets.[9]

Summers hailed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, which lifted more than six
decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking, insurance,
and investment services (by repealing key provisions in the 1933 Glass-
Steagall Act): "Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed
financial services since the Great Depression and replace them with a system
for the 21st century," Summers said.[10] "This historic legislation will
better enable American companies to compete in the new economy."[10] Many
critics, including President Barack Obama, have suggested the 2007 subprime
mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the 1933 Glass-
Steagall Act.[11]

### [edit] President of Harvard

He left the Treasury Department in 2001 when George W. Bush became President
and returned to Harvard as its 27th President, serving from July 2001 until
June 2006. He was Harvard's first Jewish president, and received praise from
Harvard's Jewish community for his support. [12]

A number of his decisions at Harvard attracted public controversy.

#### [edit] Cornel West affair

In an October 2001 meeting, Summers criticized African American Studies
department head Cornel West for missing three weeks of classes to work on the
Bill Bradley presidential campaign, and complained that West was contributing
to grade inflation. Summers also said that West's rap album was an
embarrassment to the university, and that West needed to do more scholarly
work. West denied the accusations.[13] West, who later called Summers both
"uninformed" and "an unprincipled power player" in describing this encounter
in his book Democracy Matters (2004), subsequently returned to Princeton
University, where he taught prior to Harvard University.

#### [edit] Sexism allegations

In January 2005, at a Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering
Workforce sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Summers
described three hypotheses for explaining the higher number of males in high-
end science and engineering positions. Summers claimed that he was adopting an
"entirely positive, rather than normative approach" and that his remarks were
intended to be an "attempt at provocation."[14] It was the second hypothesis,
termed "different availability of aptitude at the high end" by Summers, that
drew allegations of sexism.

According to Summers, the preponderance of males in high-end science and
engineering positions could be explained by the following: first, that more
men than women were willing to make the commitment in terms of time and
flexibility demanded by high-powered jobs; second, and controversially, that
there were differences in the intrinsic abilities of men and women at the
extremes (3.5 to 4 standard deviations above the mean), as shown by higher
variance in aptitude, abilities, or preferences relevant to science and
engineering among men (see Gender differences); and third, that the
discrepancy was due to discrimination or socialization.[14] He also stated his
view that the order given reflected the relative importance of each of the
three hypotheses.[14]

An attendee made Summers' remarks public, and an intense response followed in
the national news media and on Harvard's campus.[15] Nancy Hopkins, a
biologist at MIT, walked out during the talk in disgust.[15] It was claimed
that Summers perceived sexism cost him the job of Treasury Secretary in
Obama's Administration.[16]

#### [edit] Summers' opposition and support at Harvard

On March 15, 2005, members of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which
instructs graduate students in GSAS and undergraduates in Harvard College,
passed 218â185 a motion of "lack of confidence" in the leadership of
Summers, with 18 abstentions. A second motion that offered a milder censure of
the president passed 253 to 137, also with 18 abstentions.

The members of the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing
body, are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements
strongly supporting Summers.

FAS faculty were not unanimous in their comments on Summers. Influential
psychologist Steven Pinker defended the legitimacy of Summers' January
remarks. When asked if Summers' remarks were "within the pale of legitimate
academic discourse," Pinker responded "Good grief, shouldnât everything be
within the pale of legitimate academic discourse, as long as it is presented
with some degree of rigor? Thatâs the difference between a university and a
madrassa. [...] There is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be
taken seriously."[17]

Summers had stronger support among Harvard College students than among the
college faculty. One poll by the Harvard Crimson indicated that students
opposed his resignation by a three-to-one margin, with 57% of responding
students opposing his resignation and 19% supporting it.[18]

In July 2005, the only African-American board member of Harvard Corporation,
Conrad K. Harper, resigned saying he was angered both by the university
president's comments about women and by Summers being given a salary increase.
(Some reports[who?] suggest Harper's support of Summers may have first started
to erode earlier because of the Cornel West controversy.) The resignation
letter to the president said, "I could not and cannot support a raise in your
salary, ... I believe that Harvard's best interests require your
resignation."[19][20]

During Summers' tenure, many Harvard alumni[who?] responded by writing letters
and declining to donate in response to the various controversies. After the
Harvard Corporation accepted Summers' resignation, some[who?] pledged
contributions were canceled but other contributions were made in celebration
of his resignation. Some donors[which?] were disappointed by the Harvard
Corporation's failure to stand up to the college faculty but some
donors[which?] were impressed by the decision. Ultimately, there has been no
consensus amongst the alumni, students or faculty of Harvard University
regarding Summers' tenure. Despite the negative controversies that his conduct
and words often created, Summers led some initiatives[which?] at Harvard that
have continued to benefit the University.

#### [edit] Support of economist Andrei Shleifer

Harvard and Andrei Shleifer, a close friend and protege of Summers, settled a
$26M lawsuit by the U.S. government over the conflict of interest Shleifer had
while advising Russia's privatisation program. Summers' continued support for
Shleifer strengthened Summers' unpopularity with other professors:

"Iâve been a member of this Faculty for over 45 years, and I am no longer
easily shocked," is how Frederick H. Abernathy, the McKay professor of
mechanical engineering, began his biting comments about the Shleifer case at
Tuesdayâs fiery Faculty meeting. But, Abernathy continued, "I was deeply
shocked and disappointed by the actions of this University" in the Shleifer
affair.

In an 18,000-word article in Institutional Investor (January, 2006), the
magazine detailed Shleiferâs alleged efforts to use his inside knowledge of
and sway over the Russian economy in order to make lucrative personal
investments, all while leading a Harvard group, advising the Russian
government, that was under contract with the U.S. The article suggests that
Summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the
University.[21] Summers' friendship with Shleifer was well known by the
Corporation when it selected him to succeed Rudenstine and Summers recused
himself from all proceedings with Shleifer, whose case was actually handled by
an independent committee led by Derek Bok.

#### [edit] Resignation as Harvard President

On February 21, 2006, Summers announced his intention to step down at the end
of the school year effective June 30, 2006. Former University President Derek
Bok acted as Interim President while the University conducted a search for a
replacement which ended with the naming of Drew Gilpin Faust on February 11,
2007. After a one year sabbatical, Summers subsequently accepted the
University's invitation to serve as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor,
one of twenty select University-wide professorships, with offices in the
Kennedy School of Government and the Harvard Business School.[22] He also
joined the D. E. Shaw Group in October 2006 as a part-time managing
director.[23] Summers also has been authoring a column for the Financial
Times.[24]

### [edit] Post-Harvard career

President Barack Obama, on left, discusses with a group in the White House,
including Larry Summers on far right (back to camera)

On October 19, 2006, he became a part-time managing director of the investment
and technology development firm D. E. Shaw & Co.

Upon the death of his hero, libertarian economist Milton Friedman, Summers
wrote an Op-Ed in The New York Times entitled "The Great Liberator" arguing
that "any honest Democrat will admit that we are now all Friedmanites."
Summers wrote that while Friedman made real contributions to monetary policy,
his real contribution was "in convincing people of the importance of allowing
free markets to operate."[25]

Henry Kissinger once said that Larry Summers should "be given a White House
post in which he was charged with shooting down or fixing bad ideas." [26]

In 2006 he was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons which reviewed the
work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

He is currently the director of the White House National Economic
Council[1][27].

### [edit] National Economic Council

In January 2009, as the Obama Administration tried to pass a fiscal stimulus
bill, Oregon Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio criticized Summers,
saying that he thought that President Barack Obama is "ill-advised by Larry
Summers. Larry Summers hates infrastructure." [28]. DeFazio, along with
liberal economists including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, has argued that
more of the stimulus should be spent on infrastructure,[29] while Summers has
supported tax cuts.[citation needed]

Relations between Summers, President Obama's top economic adviser, and former
Fed Chairman Paul Volcker have also been strained recently, as Volcker has
accused Summers of delaying the effort to organize a panel of outside economic
advisers, and has cut Volcker out of White House meetings and has not shown
interest in collaborating on policy solutions to the current economic crisis.
[30]

Summers has recently come under fire for accepting perks from Citigroup,
including free rides on its corporate jet last summer.[31] According to the
Wall Street Journal, Larry Summers called Chris Dodd asking him to remove caps
on executive pay at firms which have received stimulus money, including
Citigroup. [32]

On April 3rd, 2009 Summers came under renewed criticism after it was disclosed
that he was paid millions of dollars the previous year by companies which he
now has influence over as a public servant. He earned $5 million from the
hedge fund D. E. Shaw, and collected $2.7 million in speaking fees from Wall
Street companies that received government bailout money.[33]
