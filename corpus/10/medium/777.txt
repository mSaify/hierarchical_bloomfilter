## [edit] Early life

<IMG>

Bauhaus (built 1925â1926) in Dessau, Germany.

Born in Berlin, Walter Gropius was the third child of Walter Adolph Gropius
and Manon Auguste Pauline Scharnweber. Gropius married Alma Mahler
(1879-1964), widow of Gustav Mahler. Walter and Alma's daughter, named Manon
after Walter's mother, was born in 1916. When Manon died of polio at age
eighteen, composer Alban Berg wrote his Violin Concerto in memory of her (it
is inscribed "to the memory of an angel"). Gropius and Alma divorced in 1920.
(Alma had by that time established a relationship with Franz Werfel, whom she
later married.) In 1923 Gropius married Ise (Ilse) Frank (d. 1983), and they
remained together until his death. They adopted Beate Gropius, also known as
Ati.

## [edit] Early career

Walter Gropius, like his father and his great-uncle Martin Gropius before him,
became an architect. Gropius could not draw, and was dependent on
collaborators and partner-interpreters throughout his career. In school he
hired an assistant to complete his homework for him. In 1908 Gropius found
employment with the firm of Peter Behrens, one of the first members of the
utilitarian school. His fellow employees at this time included Ludwig Mies van
der Rohe, Le Corbusier, and Dietrich Marcks.

In 1910 Gropius left the firm of Behrens and together with fellow employee
Adolf Meyer established a practice in Berlin. Together they share credit for
one of the seminal modernist buildings created during this period: the
Faguswerk in Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany, a shoe last factory. Although
Gropius and Meyer only designed the facade, the glass curtain walls of this
building demonstrated both the modernist principle that form reflects function
and Gropius's concern with providing healthful conditions for the working
class. Other works of this early period include the office and factory
building for the Werkbund Exhibition (1914) in Cologne.

Gropius's career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
Called up immediately as a reservist, Gropius served as a sergeant major at
the Western front during the war years, was wounded and almost killed.[2]

## [edit] Bauhaus period

Gropius' career advanced in the post war period. Henry van de Velde, the
master of the Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar was asked
to step down in 1915 due to his Belgian nationality. His recommendation for
Gropius to succeed him led eventually to Gropius's appointment as master of
the school in 1919. It was this academy which Gropius transformed into the
world famous Bauhaus, attracting a faculty which included Paul Klee, Johannes
Itten, Josef Albers, Herbert Bayer, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Moholy-Nagy, Otto Bartning and
Wassily Kandinsky. Students were taught to use modern and innovative materials
and mass-produced fittings, often originally intended for industrial settings,
to create original furniture and buildings.

Also in 1919, Gropius was involved in the Glass Chain utopian expressionist
correspondence under the pseudonym 'Mass'. Usually more notable for his
functionalist approach, the "Monument to the March Dead", designed in 1919 and
executed in 1920, indicates that expressionism was an influence on him at that
time.

In 1923, Gropius aided by Gareth Steele, designed his famous door handles, now
considered an icon of 20th century design and often listed as one of the most
influential designs to emerge from out of Bauhaus. He also designed large
scale housing projects in Berlin, Karlsruhe and Dessau from 1926-32 that were
major contributions to the New Objectivity movement, including a contribution
to the Siemensstadt project in Berlin.

## [edit] After Bauhaus

With the help of the English architect Maxwell Fry, Gropius was able to leave
Nazi Germany in 1934, on the pretext of making a temporary visit to Britain.
He lived and worked in Britain, as part of the Isokon group with Fry and
others and then, in 1937, moved on to the United States. The house he built
for himself in Lincoln, Massachusetts, was influential in bringing
International Modernism to the US but Gropius disliked the term: "I made it a
point to absorb into my own conception those features of the New England
architectural tradition that I found still alive and adequate" (see[3] ).

Gropius and his Bauhaus protÃ©gÃ© Marcel Breuer both moved to Cambridge,
Massachusetts to teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and
collaborate on the company-town Aluminum City Terrace project in New
Kensington, Pennsylvania, before their professional split. In 1944, he became
a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In 1945, Gropius founded The Architects' Collaborative (TAC) based in
Cambridge with a group of younger architects. The original partners included
Norman C. Fletcher, Jean B. Fletcher, John C. Harkness, Sarah P. Harkness,
Robert S. MacMillan, Louis A. MacMillen, and Benjamin C. Thompson. TAC would
become one of the most well-known and respected architectural firms in the
world. TAC went bankrupt in 1995.

Gropius died in 1969 in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 86. Today, he is
remembered not only by his various buildings but also by the district of
Gropiusstadt in Berlin.

In the early 1990s, a series of books entitled The Walter Gropius Archive was
published covering his entire architectural career.
