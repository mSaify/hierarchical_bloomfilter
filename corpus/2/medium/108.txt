### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

Aesthetics or esthetics (also spelled Ã¦sthetics) is commonly known as the
study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of
sentiment and taste.[1] More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics
as "critical reflection on art, culture and nature."[2][3] Aesthetics is a
subdiscipline of axiology, a branch of philosophy, and is closely associated
with the philosophy of art.[4] Aesthetics studies new ways of seeing and of
perceiving the world.[5]

## [edit] Etymology

The term esthetics 1790-, derives from the German Ã¤sthetisch (Alexander
Baumgarten, c. 1750)or the French esthÃ©tique, both derived from the Greek
Î±Î¹ÏÎ¸Î·ÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ (aisthetikos) "esthetic-sensitive-sentient", from
Î±Î¯ÏÎ¸Î·ÏÎ·-Î±Î¹ÏÎ¸Î¬Î½Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹ (aisthese-aisthanomai) "to perceive-feel-
sense"[6]

## [edit] Aesthetic judgment

Judgments of aesthetic value clearly rely on our ability to discriminate at a
sensory level. Aesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object
or phenomenon. Many see natural beauty folded within petals of a rose.
Immanuel Kant, writing in 1790, observes of a man "If he says that canary wine
is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and
reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to me," because "Everyone has his
own (sense of) taste". The case of "beauty" is different from mere
"agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he
requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but
for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things."

Aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination. For David Hume,
delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in
a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which
escape the rest of mankind." (Essays Moral Political and Literary.
Indianapolis, Literary Classics 5, 1987.) Thus, the sensory discrimination is
linked to capacity for pleasure. For Kant "enjoyment" is the result when
pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be "beautiful" has a
third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our
capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory,
emotional and intellectual all at once.

Viewer interpretations of beauty possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and
taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of
education and awareness of elite cultural values; therefore taste can be
learned. Taste varies according to class, cultural background, and education.
According to Kant beauty is objective and universal; thus certain things are
beautiful to everyone. The contemporary view of beauty is not based on innate
qualities, but rather on cultural specifics and individual interpretations.

### [edit] What factors are involved in an aesthetic judgment?

Judgments of aesthetic value seem often to involve many other kinds of issues
as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in
instinctual ways to facial expressions, and even behaviors like the gag
reflex. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin
pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even
though neither soup nor beards are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments
may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our
physical reactions. Seeing a sublime view of a landscape may give us a
reaction of awe, which might manifest physically as an increased heart rate or
widened eyes. These unconscious reactions may even be partly constitutive of
what makes our judgment a judgment that the landscape is sublime.

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent.
Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few
decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful.
The Abuse of Beauty, Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability,
perhaps even to sexual desirability. Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can
become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value.[7] We might
judge a Lamborghini to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status
symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for
us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.[8]

"Part and Parcel in Animal and Human Societies". in Studies in animal and
human behavior, vol. 2. pp. 115-195. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1971
(originally pub. 1950.) Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and
internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at
least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or
symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have
asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet
preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th century
thinkers. The point is already made by Hume, but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty
and the Criticâs Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus
aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions,
intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values,
subconscious behavior, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological
institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which
theory one employs.

Anthropology, especially the savanna hypothesis proposed by Gordon Orians and
others, predicts that some of the positive aesthetics that people have are
based on innate knowledge of productive human habitats. It had been shown that
people prefer and feel happier looking at trees with spreading forms much more
than looking at trees with other forms, or non-tree objects;[citation needed]
also Bright green colors, linked with healthy plants with good nutrient
qualities, were more calming than other tree colors, including less bright
greens and oranges.

### [edit] Are different art forms beautiful, disgusting, or boring in the
same way?

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are
unified across art forms. We can call a person, a house, a symphony, a
fragrance, and a mathematical proof beautiful. What characteristics do they
share which give them that status? What possible feature could a proof and a
fragrance both share in virtue of which they both count as beautiful? What
makes a painting beautiful is quite different from what makes music beautiful,
which suggests that each art form has its own language for the judgement of
aesthetics.[9]

At the same time, there is seemingly quite a lack of words to express oneself
accurately when making an aesthetic judgement. An aesthetic judgement cannot
be an empirical judgement. Therefore, due to impossibility for precision,
there is confusion about what interpretations can be culturally negotiated.
Due to imprecision in the standard English language, two completely different
feelings experienced by two different people can be represented by an
identical verbal expression. Wittgenstein stated this in his lectures on
aesthetics and language games.

A collective identification of beauty, with willing participants in a given
social spectrum, may be a socially negotiated phenomenon, discussed in a
culture or context. Is there some underlying unity to aesthetic judgment and
is there some way to articulate the similarities of a beautiful house,
beautiful proof, and beautiful sunset?[10] Defining it requires a description
of the entire phenomenon, as Wittgenstein argued in his lectures on
aesthetics. Likewise there has been long debate on how perception of beauty in
the natural world, especially perception of the human form as beautiful, is
supposed to relate to perceiving beauty in art or artefacts. This goes back at
least to Kant, with some echoes even in St. Bonaventure.[citation needed]

## [edit] Aesthetics and the philosophy of art

Aesthetics is used by some as a synonym for the philosophy of art, while
others insist on a distinction between these closely related fields. In
practice aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or
appreciation of an object (not necessarily an art object), while artistic
judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an
art work.

### [edit] What is "art?"

How best to define the term âartâ is a subject of constant contention;
many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the
basics of what we mean by the term âartâ.[11] Theodor Adorno claimed in
1969 âIt is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident.â[12]
[13] Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and programmers all
use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational
definitions that are not very similar to each other. Further it is clear that
even the basic meaning of the term "art" has changed several times over the
centuries, and has changed within the 20th century as well.

The main recent sense of the word âartâ is roughly as an abbreviation for
creative art or âfine art.â Here we mean that skill is being used to
express the artistâs creativity, or to engage the audienceâs aesthetic
sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the
âfinerâ things. Often, if the skill is being used in a functional object,
people will consider it a craft instead of art, a suggestion which is highly
disputed by many Contemporary Craft thinkers. Likewise, if the skill is being
used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered design instead of
art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called
applied art. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference
between fine art and applied art has more to do with the actual function of
the object than any clear definitional difference.[14] Art usually implies no
function other than to convey or communicate an idea.

Even as late as 1912 it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at
beauty, and thus that anything that wasn't trying to be beautiful couldn't
count as art. The cubists, dadaists, Stravinsky, and many later art movements
struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of
art, with such success that, according to Danto, "Beauty had disappeared not
only from the advanced art of the 1960âs but from the advanced philosophy of
art of that decade as well."[12] Perhaps some notion like "expression" (in
Croceâs theories) or "counter-environment" (in McLuhanâs theory) can
replace the previous role of beauty. Brian Massumi brought back "beauty" into
consideration together with "expression".[15] Another concept, as important to
the philosophy of art as "beauty," is that of the "sublime," elaborated upon
in the twentieth century by the postmodern philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard.

Perhaps (as in Kennick's theory) no definition of art is possible anymore.
Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a
Wittgensteinian fashion (as in Weitz or Beuys). Another approach is to say
that âartâ is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools
and museums and artists define as art is considered art regardless of formal
definitions. This "institutional definition of art" (see also Institutional
Critique) has been championed by George Dickie. Most people did not consider
the depiction of a Brillo Box or a store-bought urinal to be art until Andy
Warhol and Marcel Duchamp (respectively) placed them in the context of art
(i.e., the art gallery), which then provided the association of these objects
with the associations that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is
created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or
how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its
introduction to society at large. Whereas if exactly the same set of words was
written by a journalist, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a
longer article later, these would not be a poem. Leo Tolstoy, on the other
hand, claims that what makes something art or not is how it is experienced by
its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like Monroe
Beardsley argue that whether or not a piece counts as art depends on what
function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a non-
artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in
another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure). '

### [edit] What should we judge when we judge art?

Art can be difficult at the metaphysical and ontological levels as well as at
the value theory level. When we see a performance of Hamlet, how many works of
art are we experiencing, and which should we judge? Perhaps there is only one
relevant work of art, the whole performance, which many different people have
contributed to, and which will exist briefly and then disappear. Perhaps the
manuscript by Shakespeare is a distinct work of art from the play by the
troupe, which is also distinct from the performance of the play by this troupe
on this night, and all three can be judged, but are to be judged by different
standards.

Perhaps every person involved should be judged separately on his or her own
merits, and each costume or line is its own work of art (with perhaps the
director having the job of unifying them all). Similar problems arise for
music, film and even painting. Is one to judge the painting itself, the work
of the painter, or perhaps the painting in its context of presentation by the
museum workers?

These problems have been made even more difficult by the rise of conceptual
art since the 1960s. Warholâs famous Brillo Boxes are nearly
indistinguishable from actual Brillo boxes at the time. It would be a mistake
to praise Warhol for the design of his boxes (which were designed by Steve
Harvey), yet the conceptual move of exhibiting these boxes as art in a museum
together with other kinds of paintings is Warhol's. Are we judging Warholâs
concept? His execution of the concept in the medium? The curatorâs insight
in letting Warhol display the boxes? The overall result? Our experience or
interpretation of the result? Ontologically, how are we to think of the work
of art? Is it a physical object? Several objects? A class of objects? A mental
object? A fictional object? An abstract object? An event? Or simply an Act?

### [edit] What should art be like?

Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some
goal or another is superior in some way. Clement Greenberg, for instance,
argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it
unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other
than expression of its own uniqueness as a form.[16] The Dadaist Tristan Tzara
on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad
social order. âWe must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the
individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world
abandoned to the hands of bandits.â[17] Formal goals, creative goals, self-
expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even
more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art
should be like.

### [edit] The value of art

Tolstoy defined art, and not incidentally characterized its value, this way:
"Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by
means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived
through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also
experience them."

The value of art, then, is one with the value of empathy.

Other possible views are these: Art can act as a means to some special kind of
knowledge. Art may give insight into the human condition. Art relates to
science and religion. Art serves as a tool of education, or indoctrination, or
enculturation. Art makes us more moral. It uplifts us spiritually. Art is
politics by other means. Art has the value of allowing catharsis. In any case,
the value of art may determine the suitability of an art form. Do they
different significantly in their values, or (if not) in their ability to
achieve the unitary value of art?

But to approach the question of the value of art systematically, one ought to
ask: for whom? For the artist? For the audience? For society at large, and/or
for individuals beyond the audience? Is the "value" of art different in each
of these different contexts?

Working on the intended value of art tends to help define the relations
between art and other acts. Art clearly does have spiritual goals in many
contexts, but what exactly is the difference between religious art and
religion per se? The truth is complex - Art is both useless in a functional
sense and the most important human activity.

It has been said, that a Vogon Starship arriving at the earth and ordering its
destruction would ask what use is humanity? The only justification humanity
could give would be a Shakespeare play, a Rembrandt or a Bach concerto. These
are the things of value which define humanity itself. [18]

## [edit] Aesthetic universals

The philosopher Denis Dutton identified seven universal signatures in human
aesthetics:[19]

  1. Expertise or virtuosity. Technical artistic skills are cultivated, recognized, and admired.
  2. Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and don't demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
  3. Style. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
  4. Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
  5. Imitation. With a few important exceptions like music and abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
  6. Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.
  7. Imagination. Artists and their audiences entertain hypothetical worlds in the theater of the imagination.

It might be objected, however, that there are rather too many exceptions to
Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist
Thomas Hirschhorn deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can
appreciate a Renaissance Madonna for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often
had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. 'Rules of
composition' that might be read into Duchamp's Fountain or John Cage's 4'33"
do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style
recognizable at the time of the works' realisation). Moreover, some of
Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical
worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory.

Increasingly, academics in both the sciences and the humanities are looking to
evolutionary psychology and cognitive science in an effort to understand the
connection between psychology and aesthetics. Aside from Dutton, others
exploring this realm include Brian Boyd, Noel Carroll, Nancy Easterlin, David
Evans, Jonathan Gottschall, Paul Hernadi, Bracha Ettinger, Patrick Hogan,
Elaine Scarry, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Wendy Steiner, Robert Storey,
Frederick Turner, and Mark Turner.

## [edit] Anti-Aesthetics

The philosophy of aesthetics has been criticized by some sociologists and
writers about art and society. Raymond Williams argues that there is no unique
aesthetic object but a continuum of cultural forms from ordinary speech to
experiences that are signaled as art by a frame, institution or special event.
Pierre Bourdieu also takes issue with Kant's aesthetics and argues that it
represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and
scholarly leisure.

### [edit] Ancient aesthetics

We have examples of pre-historic art, but they are rare, and the context of
their production and use is not very clear, so we can little more than guess
at the aesthetic doctrines that guided their production and interpretation.

Ancient art was largely, but not entirely, based on the seven great ancient
civilizations: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, Persia, India and China. Each
of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic
style in its art. Greece had the most influence on the development of
aesthetics in the West. This period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human
physical form and the development of corresponding skills to show musculature,
poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. Furthermore, in many
Western and Eastern cultures alike, traits such as body hair are rarely
depicted in art that addresses physical beauty.[cite this quote] More in
contrast with this Greek-Western aesthetic taste is the genre of
grotesque.[20]

Greek philosophers initially felt that aesthetically appealing objects were
beautiful in and of themselves. Plato felt that beautiful objects incorporated
proportion, harmony, and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the
Metaphysics, Aristotle found that the universal elements of beauty were order,
symmetry, and definiteness.

### [edit] Islamic aesthetics

Islamic art is not, properly speaking, an art pertaining to religion only. The
term "Islamic" refers not only to the religion, but to any form of art created
in an Islamic culture or in an Islamic context. It would also be a mistake to
assume that all Muslims are in agreement on the use of art in religious
observance, the proper place of art in society, or the relation between
secular art and the demands placed on the secular world to conform to
religious precepts. Islamic art frequently adopts secular elements and
elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic
theologians.[21]

According to Islam, human works of art are inherently flawed compared to the
work of God; thus, it is believed by many that to attempt to depict in a
realistic form any animal or person is insolence to God. This tendency has had
the effect of narrowing the field of artistic possibility to such forms of art
as Arabesque, mosaic, Islamic calligraphy, and Islamic architecture, as well
as more generally any form of abstraction that can claim the status of non-
representational art.

The limited possibilities has been explored by artists as an outlet to
artistic expression, and has been cultivated to become a positive style and
tradition, emphasizing the decorative function of art, or its religious
functions via non-representational forms such as Geometric patterns, floral
patterns, and arabesques.

It is a common myth that human or animal depiction is forbidden altogether in
Islamic cultures. In fact, human portrayals can be found in all Islamic
cultures with varying degrees of acceptance by religious authorities. It is
only human representation for the purpose of worship that is uniformly
considered idolatry as forbidden in Sharia law. There are also many depictions
of Muhammad, Islam's chief prophet, in historical Islamic art.[22][23]

The calligraphic arts grew out an effort to devote oneself to the study of the
Koran. By patiently transcribing each word of the text, the writer was made to
contemplate the meaning of it. As time passed, these calligraphic works began
to be prized as works of art, growing increasingly elaborate in the
illumination and stylizing of the text. These illuminations were applied to
other works besides the Koran, and it became a respected art form in and of
itself.

### [edit] Indian aesthetics

Indian art evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or
philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically.
According to Kapila Vatsyayan, "Classical Indian architecture, sculpture,
painting, literature (kÄvya), music, and dancing evolved their own rules
conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not
only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind,
but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the
spiritual states were worked out in detail."

Of particular concern to Indian drama and literature is the term rasa
referring generally to the emotional flavors crafted into the work by the
writer and relished by a 'sensitive spectator' or sahá¹daya. Poets like
KÄlidÄsa were attentive to rasa, which blossomed into a fully developed
aesthetic system. Even in contemporary India the term rasa denoting "flavor"
is used colloquially to describe the aesthetic experiences in films; "mÄsala
mix" describes popular Hindi cinema films which serve a balanced emotional
meal, savored as rasa by the spectator.

Rasa theory blossoms beginning with the Sanskrit text NÄtyashÄstra (nÄtya
meaning "drama" and shÄstra meaning "science of"), a work attributed to
Bharata Muni where the Gods declare that drama is the 'Fifth Veda' because it
is suitable for the degenerate age as the best form of religious instruction.
While the date of composition varies wildly among scholars, ranging from the
era of Plato and Aristotle to the seventh century CE. The NÄtyashÄstra
presents the aesthetic concepts of rasas and their associated bhÄvas in
Chapters Six and Seven respectively, which appear to be independent of the
work as a whole. Eight rasas and associated bhÄvas are named and their
enjoyment is likened to savoring a meal: rasa is the enjoyment of flavors that
arise from the proper preparation of ingredients and the quality of
ingredients. What rasa actually is, in a theoretical sense, is not discussed
and given the NÄtyashÄstra's pithy wording it is unlikely the exact
understanding of the original author(s) will be known.

The theory of the rasas develops significantly with the Kashmiri aesthetician
Ãndandavardhana's classic on poetics, the DhvanyÄloka which introduces the
ninth rasa, shÄnta-rasa as a specifically religious feeling of peace
(ÅÄnta) which arises from its bhÄva, weariness of the pleasures of the
world. The primary purpose of this text is to refine the literary concept
dhvani or poetic suggestion, by arguing for the existence of rasa-dhvani,
primarily in forms of Sanskrit including a word, sentence or whole work
"suggests" a real-world emotional state or bhÄva, but thanks to aesthetic
distance, the sensitive spectator relishes the rasa, the aesthetic flavor of
tragedy, heroism or romance.

The 9th - 10th century master of the religious system known as "the nondual
Shaivism of Kashmir" (or "Kashmir Shaivism") and aesthetician, Abhinavagupta
brought rasa theory to its pinnacle in his separate commentaries on the
DhvanyÄloka, the DhvanyÄloka-locana (translated by Ingalls, Masson and
Patwardhan, 1992) and the Abhinavabharati, his commentary on the
NÄtyashÄstra, portions of which are translated by Gnoli and Masson and
Patwardhan. Abhinavagupta offers for the first time a technical definition of
rasa which is the universal bliss of the Self or Atman colored by the
emotional tone of a drama. ShÄnta-rasa functions as an equal member of the
set of rasas but is simultaneously distinct being the most clear form of
aesthetic bliss. Abhinavagupta likens it to the string of a jeweled necklace;
while it may not be the most appealing for most people, it is the string that
gives form to the necklace, allowing the jewels of the other eight rasas to be
relished. Relishing the rasas and particularly shÄnta-rasa is hinted as being
as-good-as but never-equal-to the bliss of Self-realization experienced by
yogis.

### [edit] Chinese aesthetics

Chinese art has a long history of varied styles and emphases. In ancient times
philosophers were already arguing about aesthetics. Confucius emphasized the
role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening
human nature and aiding âliâ (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to
what is essential about humanity. His opponent Mozi, however, argued that
music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich but not
the common people.

By the 4th century A.D., artists were debating in writing over the proper
goals of art as well. Gu Kaizhi has 3 surviving books on this theory of
painting, for example, and it's not uncommon to find later artist/scholars who
both create art and write about the creating of art. Religious and
philosophical influence on art was common (and diverse) but never universal;
it is easy to find art that largely ignores philosophy and religion in almost
every Chinese time period.

### [edit] Sub-Saharan African aesthetics

Sub-Saharan African art existed in many forms and styles, and with fairly
little influence from outside Africa. Most of it followed traditional forms
and the aesthetic norms were handed down orally as well as written. Sculpture
and performance art are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms
are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition
began in earnest. The Nok culture is testimony to this. The mosque of Timbuktu
shows that specific areas of Africa developed unique aesthetics.

### [edit] Western medieval aesthetics

Surviving medieval art is largely religious in focus, and typically was funded
by the State, Orthodox or Roman Catholic church, powerful ecclesiastical
individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. Often the pieces have an intended
liturgical function, such as chalices or churches.

Medieval Art Objects were made from rare and valuable materials, such as Gold
and Lapis, the cost of which was often superior to the wages of the maker.

Art and aesthetic philosophy was a continuation of ancient lines of thought,
with the additional use of explicit theological categories. St.
Bonaventureâs âRetracing the Arts to Theologyâ discusses the skills of
the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind
via four âlightsâ: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses
the world of artifacts, as guided by the light of sense perception which
discloses the world of natural forms, as guided by the light of philosophy
which discloses the world of intellectual truth, as guided by the light of
divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth.

Saint Thomas Aquinas' aesthetic theory is arguably more famous and influential
among the medieval aesthetic theories, having been explicitly used in the
writing of the famous writer James Joyce as well as many other influential
20th century authors. Thomas, as with many of the other medievals, never
explicitly gives an account of "beauty" in itself, but the theory is
reconstructed on the basis of disparate comments in a wide array of works. His
theory follows the classical model of Aristotle, but with explicit formulation
of beauty as "pulchrum transcendentalis" or convertible with being among the
other "transcendentals" such as "truth" and "goodness." Umberto Eco's The
Aestetics of Thomas Aquinas identifies the three main characteristics of
beautiful things in Aquinas' philosophy as: integritas, consonantia, and
claritas. Aristotle identifies the first two characteristics, with the third
being an "innovation" of Aquinas in the light of Platonic/neo-Platonic and
Augustinian thought. In sum, medieval aesthetic, while not a unified system,
presents a unique view of beauty that deserves an in-depth treatment in the
history of art.

As the medieval world shifts into the Renaissance, art again returns to focus
on this world and on secular issues of human life. The philosophy of art of
the ancient Greeks and Romans is re-appropriated.

## [edit] Modern aesthetics

From the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a
slow revolution into what is often called modernism. German and British
thinkers emphasised beauty as the key component of art and of the aesthetic
experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at beauty.

For Baumgarten aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger
sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that
sense experience can have. For Kant the aesthetic experience of beauty is a
judgment of a subjective but universal truth, since all people should agree
that âthis rose is beautifulâ if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be
reduced to any more basic set of features. For Schiller aesthetic appreciation
of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts
of human nature.

For Hegel all culture is a matter of "absolute spirit" coming to be manifest
to itself, stage by stage. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit
is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather
than subjective revelation of beauty. For Schopenhauer aesthetic contemplation
of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of
will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly
agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of
the beauty.

The British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The
intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single
mental faculty of some kind. For the Earl of Shaftesbury this was identical to
the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness. For
Wittgenstein aesthetics consisted in the description of a whole culture which
is a linguistic impossibility. That which constitutes aesthetics lies out side
the realm of the language game.

For Hutcheson beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a
subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like Lord
Kames, William Hogarth, and Edmund Burke hoped to reduce beauty to some list
of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1)
fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible;
(3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps
to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which
gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy
variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active
energies, leading the eye on "a wanton kind of chase"; and (6) quantity or
magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later
analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of
psychology (such as James Mill) or biology (such as Herbert Spencer).

## [edit] Post-modern aesthetics and Psychoanalysis

Early twentieth century artists, poets and composers challenged the assumption
that beauty was central to art and aesthetics. Various attempts have been made
since then to define Post-modern aesthetics.

This challenge, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older
aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify
"beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction
between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the
higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for
tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo.

Croce suggested that âexpressionâ is central in the way that beauty was
once thought to be central. George Dickie suggested that the sociological
institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into
unities. Marshall McLuhan suggested that art always functions as a "counter-
environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a
society. Theodor Adorno felt that aesthetics could not proceed without
confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and
aesthetic experience. Hal Foster (art critic) attempted to portray the
reaction against beauty and Modernist art in The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on
Postmodern Culture. Arthur Danto has described this reaction as "kalliphobia"
(after the Greek word for beauty - 'kalos').[24] Brian Massumi suggests to
reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of
Deleuze and Guattari.[25]

Daniel Berlyne created the field of experimental aesthetics in the 1970s, for
which he is still the most cited individual decades after his death.[26]

Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard re-invokes the Kantian distinction between taste and
the sublime. Sublime painting, unlike kitsch realism, "...will enable us to
see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing
pain."[27][28]

Sigmund Freud inaugurated aesthetical thinking in Psychoanalysis mainly via
the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.[29] Following Freud and

Merleau-Ponty,[30] Jacques Lacan approached the aesthetical object in the
visual field by the notion of the gaze as lacking and as phallic "objet a"
that follows the psychic "masculine" principle of separation and
castration.[31][32]

## [edit] Aesthetics and Information

In the 1970s, Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake were among the first to analyze
links between aesthetics, information processing, and information theory [33]
[34].

In the 1990s, JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber described an algorithmic theory of beauty
which takes the subjectivity of the observer into account and postulates:
among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective
observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest
description, given the observerâs previous knowledge and his particular
method for encoding the data[35][36]. This is closely related to the
principles of algorithmic information theory and minimum description length.
One of his examples: mathematicians enjoy simple proofs with a short
description in their formal language. Another very concrete example describes
an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by
very few bits of information[37][38], drawing inspiration from less detailed
15th century proportion studies by Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht DÃ¼rer.
Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's beautiful and
what's interesting, stating that interestingness corresponds to the first
derivative of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any
observer continually tries to improve the predictability and compressibility
of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and
symmetries and fractal self-similarity. Whenever the observer's learning
process (which may be a predictive neural network) leads to improved data
compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer bits
than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the
number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the
observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A reinforcement
learning algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to
execute action sequences that cause additional interesting input data with yet
unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be
implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of artificial
curiosity[39][40][41][42].

## [edit] Applied aesthetics

Main article: Applied aesthetics

As well as being applied to art aesthetics can also be applied to cultural
objects. Aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by
speakers working for the US Information Agency[43] This coupling was made to
reinforce the learning paradigm when English-language speakers used
translators to address audiences in their own country. These audiences were
generally not fluent in the English language. It can also be used in topics as
diverse as mathematics, gastronomy and fashion design.

## [edit] Aesthetic ethics

Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to
be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. John Dewey [44] has
pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact relfected in
our understanding of behaviour being "fair" - the word having a double meaning
of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, James Page [45] has
suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical
rationale for peace education.

## [edit] Truth as beauty, mathematics, analytic philosophy, and physics

Mathematical considerations, such as symmetry and complexity, are used for
analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic
considerations of applied aesthetics used in the study of mathematical beauty.
Aesthetic considerations such as symmetry and simplicity are used in areas of
philosophy, such as ethics and theoretical physics and cosmology to define
truth, outside of empirical considerations. Beauty and Truth have been argued
to be nearly synonymous.[46]
