## [edit] Quadrance and spread

Instead of distance and angle, rational trigonometry uses as its fundamental
units quadrance (square of distance) and spread (square of sine of angle).[1]
This choice of variables enables calculations to produce output results whose
complexity matches that of the input data. For instance, in a typical
trigonometry problem if rational numbers are assigned to all quadrances and
spreads, then the calculated results will be rational numbers (or roots of
rational numbers).

This rationality is obtained at the expense of linearity. Unlike the
traditional distance and angle units, doubling or halving a quadrance or
spread does not double or halve a length or a rotation. Similarly, the sum of
two lengths or rotations is not the sum of their individual quadrances or
spreads.

For distinction, Wildberger refers to the traditional trigonometry as
classical trigonometry. It is otherwise broadly based on Cartesian analytic
geometry, with a point defined as an ordered pair (x, y) and a line as a
general linear equation

    Ax + By + C = 0.\\,
The mathematics of rational trigonometry is, applications aside, a special
instance of the description of geometry in terms of linear algebra (using
rational methods such as dot products and quadratic forms), but students who
are first learning trigonometry are often not taught about the use of linear
algebra in geometry. Changing this state of affairs is a stated aim of
Wildberger's book (to paraphrase his comments).

## [edit] Trigonometry over finite fields

Rational trigonometry makes it possible to do trigonometry over finite fields
in the same way as over the field of real numbers.

## [edit] Quadrance

The quadrance is the square of the distance.[1]

Quadrance and distance are concerned with the separation of points. Quadrance
differs from standard distance in that it squares the distance. Most
immediately, this means that calculating the distance (or, more accurately,
quadrance) between two points in 2-dimensional space is easier, as there is no
need to find the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in
the x and y coordinates.

In the (x, y)-plane, the quadrance Q(A1, A2) for the points A1 and A1 is
defined as

    Q\(A_1, A_2\) = \(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2.\\,[1]
## [edit] Spread

<IMG>

<IMG>

Suppose â 1 and â 2 intersect at the point A. Let C be the foot of the
perpendicular from B to â 2. Then the spread is s = Q/R.

<IMG>

<IMG>

The spread of two lines can be measured in four equivalent positions.

Spread, a measure of the separation of lines, is a dimensionless number in the
range [0, 1]. The value of the spread is the square of the sine of the
angle.[1]

Suppose two lines, â 1 and â 2, intersect at the point A as shown at
right. Choose a point B â  A on â 1 and let C be the foot of the
perpendicular from B to â 2. Then the spread s is

    s\(\\ell_1, \\ell_2\) = \\frac{Q\(B, C\)}{Q\(A, B\)} = \\frac{Q}{R}.[1]
See also spread polynomials.

### [edit] Spread compared to angle

In rational trigonometry, spread is a fundamental concept, somewhat but not
precisely corresponding to the concept in traditional geometry of angle.
Spread describes a relationship between two lines, whereas angle describes a
relationship between two rays emanating from a common point.[1]

The spread is the square of the sine of the angle.

Degree Radian Spread  
0 0 0  
30 (1/6)Ï 1/4  
45 (1/4)Ï 1/2  
60 (1/3)Ï 3/4  
90 (1/2)Ï 1  
120 (2/3)Ï 3/4  
135 (3/4)Ï 1/2  
150 (5/6)Ï 1/4  
180 Ï 0  
Spread is not proportional to degrees or radians, and has a period of 180
degrees (Ï radians).

## [edit] Laws of rational trigonometry

Wildberger states that there are five basic laws in rational trigonometry and
these laws can be easily verified using high-school level mathematics. Some
are equivalent to standard trigonometrical formulae with the variables
expressed as quadrance and spread.[1]

### [edit] Triple quad formula

The three points A1,A2,A3 are collinear precisely when:

    \(Q_{1} + Q_{2} + Q_{3}\)^2 = 2\(Q_{1}^{2} + Q_{2}^{2} + Q_{3}^{2}\).\\,
This is equivalent to using Heron's formula, the condition for collinearity
being that the triangle formed by the three points has zero area.

It can either be proved by analytic geometry (the preferred means within
rational trigonometry) or derived from Heron's formula, using the condition
for collinearity that the triangle formed by the three points has zero area.

Proof

<IMG>

<IMG>

Illustration of nomenclature used in the proof.

The line AB\\, has the general form:

    ax + by + c = 0\\,
where the (non-unique) parameters a\\,, b\\, and c\\,, can be expressed in
terms of the coordinates of points A\\, and B\\, as:

    a = A_y - B_y\\,
    b = B_x - A_x\\,
    c = A_xB_y - A_yB_x\\,
so that, everywhere on the line:

    \(A_y - B_y\)x + \(B_x - A_x\)y + \(A_xB_y - A_yB_x\) = 0.\\,
But the line can also be specified by two simultaneous equations in a
parameter t\\,, where t = 0\\, at point A\\, and t = 1\\, at point B\\,:

    x = \(B_x - A_x\)t + A_x\\, and y = \(B_y - A_y\)t + A_y\\,
or, in terms of the original parameters:

    x = bt + A_x\\, and y = -at + A_y.\\,
If the point C\\, is collinear with points A\\, and B\\,, there exists some
value of t\\, (for distinct points, not equal to 0 or 1), call it \\lambda\\,,
for which these two equations are simultaneously satisfied at the coordinates
of the point C\\,, such that:

    C_x = b\\lambda\\ + A_x and C_y = -a\\lambda\\ + A_y.\\,
Now, the quadrances of the three line segments are given by the squared
differences of their coordinates, which can be expressed in terms of
\\lambda\\,:

    \\begin{matrix}Q\(AB\) & \\equiv & \(B_x - A_x\)^2 + \(B_y - A_y\)^2 \\\\ \\ & = & b^2 + \(-a\)^2 \\\\ \\ & = & a^2 + b^2\\end{matrix}
    \\begin{matrix}Q\(BC\) & \\equiv & \(C_x - B_x\)^2 + \(C_y - B_y\)^2 \\\\ \\ & = & \(\(b\\lambda\\ + A_x\) -B_x\)^2 + \(\(-a\\lambda\\ + A_y\) - B_y\)^2 \\\\ \\ & = & \(b\\lambda\\ + \(A_x -B_x\)\)^2 + \(-a\\lambda\\ + \(A_y - B_y\)\)^2\\\\ \\ & = & \(b\\lambda\\ + \(-b\)\)^2 + \(-a\\lambda\\ + a\)^2\\\\ \\ & = & b^2\(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2 + a^2\(-\\lambda\\ + 1\)^2 \\\\ \\ & = & b^2\(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2 + a^2\(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2\\\\ \\ & = & \(a^2 + b^2\)\(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2\\end{matrix}
    \\begin{matrix}Q\(AC\) & \\equiv & \(C_x - A_x\)^2 + \(C_y - A_y\)^2 \\\\ \\ & = & \(\(b\\lambda\\ + A_x\) - A_x\)^2 + \(\(-a\\lambda\\ + A_y\) - A_y\)^2 \\\\ \\ & = & \(b\\lambda\\ + A_x - A_x\)^2 + \(-a\\lambda\\ + A_y - A_y\)^2\\\\ \\ & = & \(b\\lambda\)^2 + \(-a\\lambda\)^2\\\\ \\ & = & b^2\\lambda^2 + \(-a\)^2\\lambda^2\\\\ \\ & = & b^2\\lambda^2 + a^2\\lambda^2\\\\ \\ & = & \(a^2 + b^2\)\\lambda^2\\end{matrix}
where use was made of the fact that \(-\\lambda\\ + 1\)^2 = \(\\lambda\\ -
1\)^2.

Substituting these quadrances into the equation to be proved:

    \(Q\(AB\) + Q\(BC\) + Q\(AC\)\)^2 = 2\(Q\(AB\)^{2} + Q\(BC\)^{2} + Q\(AC\)^{2}\)\\,
    \(\(a^2 + b^2\) + \(a^2 + b^2\)\(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2 + \(a^2 + b^2\)\\lambda^2\)^2 = 2\(\(a^2 + b^2\)^2 + \(\(a^2 + b^2\)\(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2\)^2 + \(\(a^2 + b^2\)\\lambda^2\)^2\)\\,
    \(a^2 + b^2\)^2\(1 + \(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2 + \\lambda^2\)^2 = 2\(a^2 + b^2\)^2\(1 + \(\(\\lambda\\ - 1\)^2\)^2 + \(\\lambda^2\)^2\)\\,
Now, if A\\, and B\\, represent distinct points, such that \(a^2 + b^2\)\\, is
not zero, we may divide both sides by Q\(AB\)^2 = \(a^2 + b^2\)^2\\,:

    \(1 + \\lambda^2 -2\\lambda\\ + 1 + \\lambda^2\)^2 = 2\(1 + \(\\lambda^2 -2\\lambda\\ + 1\)^2 + \\lambda^4\)\\,
    \(2\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda\\ + 2\)^2 = 2\(1 + \\lambda^4 - 2\\lambda^3 + \\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda^3 + 4\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + \\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1 + \\lambda^4\)\\,
    4\(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda\\ + 1\)^2 = 2\(2\\lambda^4 - 4\\lambda^3 + 6\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 2\)\\,
    4\(\\lambda^4 - \\lambda^3 + \\lambda^2 - \\lambda^3 + \\lambda^2 - \\lambda + \\lambda^2 - \\lambda + 1\) = 4\(\\lambda^4 - 2\\lambda^3 + 3\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1\)\\,
    \\lambda^4 - 2\\lambda^3 + 3\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1 = \\lambda^4 - 2\\lambda^3 + 3\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1\\,
Q.E.D.

### [edit] Pythagoras' theorem

The lines A1A3 and A2A3 are perpendicular precisely when:

    Q_{1} + Q_{2}= Q_{3}.\\,
This is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem.

There are many classical proofs of Pythagoras' theorem; this one is framed in
the terms of rational trigonometry.

The spread of an angle is the square of its sine. Given the triangle ABC with
a spread of 1 between sides AB and AC,

    Q\(AB\) + Q\(AC\) = Q\(BC\)\\,
where Q is the "quadrance", i.e. the square of the distance.

Proof

<IMG>

<IMG>

Illustration of nomenclature used in the proof.

Construct a line AD dividing the spread of 1, with the point D on line BC, and
making a spread of 1 with DB and DC. The triangles ABC, DBA and DAC are
similar (have the same spreads but not the same quadrances).

This leads to two equations in ratios, based on the spreads of the sides of
the triangle:

    s_C = \\frac{Q\(AB\)}{Q\(BC\)} = \\frac{Q\(BD\)}{Q\(AB\)} = \\frac{Q\(AD\)}{Q\(AC\)}.
    s_B = \\frac{Q\(AC\)}{Q\(BC\)} = \\frac{Q\(DC\)}{Q\(AC\)} = \\frac{Q\(AD\)}{Q\(AB\)}.
Now in general, the two spreads resulting from dividing a spread into two
parts, as line AD does for spread CAB, do not add up to the original spread
since spread is a non-linear function. So we first prove that dividing a
spread of 1, results in two spreads that do add up to the original spread of
1.

For convenience, but with no loss of generality, we orient the lines
intersecting with a spread of 1 to the coordinate axes, and label the dividing
line with coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Then the two spreads are given by:

    s_1 = \\frac{\(x_2 - x_2\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2}{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2}
= \\frac{\(y_2 - y_1\)^2}{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2},

    s_2 = \\frac{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_2\)^2}{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2}
= \\frac{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2}{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2}.

Hence:

    s_1 + s_ 2 = \\frac{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2}{\(x_2 - x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2}
= 1.\\,

So that:

    s_C + s_B = 1.\\,
Using the first two ratios from the first set of equations, this can be
rewritten:

    \\frac{Q\(AB\)}{Q\(BC\)} + \\frac{Q\(AC\)}{Q\(BC\)} = 1.\\,
Multiplying both sides by Q(BC):

    Q\(AB\) + Q\(AC\) = Q\(BC\).\\,
Q.E.D.

### [edit] Spread law

For any triangle \\overline{A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}} with non zero quadrances:

    \\frac{s_{1}}{Q_{1}}=\\frac{s_{2}}{Q_{2}}=\\frac{s_{3}}{Q_{3}}.\\,
This is equivalent to the law of sines.

### [edit] Cross law

For any triangle \\overline{A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}} define the cross c3 as c3 = 1
â s3. Then:

    \(Q_1 + Q_2 - Q_3\)^2 = 4Q_1 Q_2 c_3.\\,
This is equivalent to the law of cosines.

### [edit] Triple spread formula

For any triangle \\overline{A_1 A_2 A_3},

    \(s_1 + s_2 + s_3\)^2 = 2\(s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2\) + 4s_1 s_ 2 s_ 3 .\\,
This corresponds (roughly) to the angle sum formulae for sine and cosine.

## [edit] Calculating quadrance and spread

<IMG>

<IMG>

Spread calculation

Given the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the quadrance
between them is

    Q = \(x_2 -x_1\)^2 + \(y_2 - y_1\)^2.\\,
Given two line segments A1A3 and A1A3 (forming an angle at point A3, the
spread between them is

    
\\begin{align}

s & = 1 - \\frac{\(Q_1 + Q_2 - Q_3 \)^2}{4Q_1 Q_2} \\\\\[6pt\]

  & = \\frac{ 2Q_1 Q_2 + 2Q_1 Q_3 + 2Q_2 Q_3 - Q_1^2 - Q_2^2 - Q_3^2}{4Q_1
Q_2}

\\end{align}

where Q1 is the quadrance of the side opposite the vertex A1, Q2 is the
quadrance of the side opposite the vertex A2, Q3 is the quadrance of the side
opposite the vertex A3.

Given the coordinates of two points on each of two lines (x11,y11), (x12,y12)
and (x21,y21) (x22,y22), the spread s between them can be calculated as:

    s = \\frac{\(\(x_{12} - x_{11}\)\(y_{22} - y_{21}\) - \(x_{22} - x_{21}\)\(y_{12} - y_{11}\)\)^2}{\(\(x_{12}-x_{11}\)^2+\(y_{12}-y_{11}\)^2\) \(\(x_{22}-x_{21}\)^2+\(y_{22}-y_{21}\)^2\)}
or

    s = \\frac{\(\\Delta x_1 \\, \\Delta y_2  - \\Delta x_2\\, \\Delta y_1\)^{2}}{Q_1 Q_2}.\\,
If the lines described by the points emanate from or are shifted to the origin
by subtracting the coordinates of the first point from each line, as
illustrated on the right, the computation simplifies to

    s = \\frac{\(x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1\)^2}{Q_1 Q_2}.\\,
