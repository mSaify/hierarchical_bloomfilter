Quantum mind theories are based on the premise that quantum mechanics is
necessary to fully understand the mind and brain, particularly concerning an
explanation of consciousness. This approach is considered a minority opinion
in science, although it does have the support of the well-known Roger Penrose,
who has proposed a quantum mind theory in conjunction with Stuart Hameroff.
Karl H. Pribram and Henry Stapp have also proposed variations.

## [edit] Introduction

The quantum mind hypothesis proposes that classical mechanics cannot fully
explain consciousness and suggests that quantum mechanical phenomena such as
quantum entanglement and superposition may play an important part in the
brain's function and could form the basis of an explanation of consciousness.

Supporters of the quantum mind hypothesis have not submitted any evidence to
support its claims for peer review, but the hypothesis has also not been
falsified.

This theory is still in its early phases.

## [edit] Motivation

### [edit] Consciousness Banished

A common argument underlying the quantum mind thesis is that classical
mechanics cannot explain consciousness, if only because Galileo and Newton
(together with their admirers, viz.: Locke, Hobbes and Descartes) excluded the
secondary qualities from the physical world[citation needed].

Fritjof Capra writes:

> To make it possible for scientists to describe nature mathematically,
Galileo postulated that they should restrict themselves to studying the
essential properties of material bodiesâshapes, numbers, and
movementâwhich could be measured and quantified. Other properties, like
color, sound, taste, or smell, were merely subjective mental projections which
should be excluded from the domain of science. [1]

Proponents of the Quantum mind state that perceived qualities such as sound,
taste and smell are an essential part of the human experience and therefore
cannot be discounted. They posit that classical mechanics fails to account for
the experience of such phenomena. Similarly, they hypothesize that the
internal experiences of consciousness, such as dreaming and memory, all of
which are 'part and parcel' of everyday human experience remain unaccounted
for.

### [edit] Minimization of Mystery

The philosopher David Chalmers half-jokingly claims that the motivation for
Quantum Mind theories is: "a Law of Minimization of Mystery: consciousness is
mysterious and quantum mechanics is mysterious, so maybe the two mysteries
have a common source." [2]

## [edit] Examples of theories

### [edit] David Bohm

David Bohm took the view that quantum theory and relativity contradicted one
another, and that this contradiction implied that there existed a more
fundamental level in the physical universe[3][dead link]. He claimed that both
quantum theory and relativity pointed towards this deeper theory. This more
fundamental level was supposed to represent an undivided wholeness and an
implicate order, from which arose the explicate order of the universe as we
experience it.

Bohm's implicate order applies both to matter and consciousness, and he
proposed that it could explain the relationship between them. Mind and matter
are here seen as projections into our explicate order from the underlying
reality of the implicate order. Bohm claims that when we look at the matter in
space, we can see nothing in these concepts that helps us to understand
consciousness.

In Bohm's scheme there is a fundamental level where consciousness is not
distinct from matter. Bohm's view of consciousness is connected to Karl
Pribram's holographic conception of the brain [4] [5][dead link]. Pribram
regards sight and the other senses as lenses without which the other senses
would appear as a hologram. Pribram proposes that information is recorded all
over the brain, and that it is enfolded into a whole, similar to a hologram.
It is suggested that memories are connected by association and manipulated by
logical thought. If the brain is also receiving sensory input all these are
proposed to unite in overall experience or consciousness.

In trying to describe the nature of consciousness, Bohm discusses the
experience of listening to music. He thinks that the feeling of movement and
change that make up our experience of music derives from both the immediate
past and the present being held in the brain together, with the notes from the
past seen as transformations rather than memories. The notes that were
implicate in the immediate past are seen as becoming explicate in the present.
Bohm compares this to consciousness emerging from the implicate order.

Bohm sees the movement, change or flow and also the coherence of experiences
such as listening to music as a manifestation of the implicate order. He
claims to derive evidence for this from the work of Piaget[6] in studying
infants. He claims that these studies show that young children have to learn
about time and space, because they are part of the explicate order, but have a
'hard-wired' understanding of movement because it is part of the implicate
order. He compares this 'hard-wiring' to Chomsky's theory that grammar is
'hard-wired' into young human brains. In his writings, Bohm never proposed any
specific brain mechanism by which his implicate order could emerge in a way
that was relevant to consciousness.

### [edit] Gustav Bernroider

Recent papers by physicist, Gustav Bernroider, have indicated that he thinks
that Bohm's implicate-explicate structure can account for the relationship
between neural processes and consciousness[7]. In a paper published in 2005
Bernroider elaborated his proposals for the physical basis of this process[8].
The main thrust of his paper was the argument that quantum coherence may be
sustained in ion channels for long enough to be relevant for neural processes
and the channels could be entangled with surrounding lipids and proteins and
with other channels in the same membrane. Ion channels regulate the electrical
potential across the axon membrane and thus play a central role in the brain's
information processing.

Bernroider bases his work on recent studies of the potassium (K+)ion channel
in its closed state and draws particularly on the atomic-level spectroscopy
work of the MacKinnon group [9][10][11][12][13]. The ion channels have a
filter region which allows in K+ ions and bars other ions. These studies show
that the filter region has a framework of five sets of four oxygen atoms,
which are part of the carboxyl group of amino-acid molecules in the
surrounding protein. These are referred to as binding pockets. Two K+ ions are
trapped in the selection filter of the closed ion channel. Each of these ions
is electrostatically bound to two sets of oxygen atoms or binding pockets,
involving eight oxygen atoms in total. Both ions in the channel oscillate
between two configurations.

Bernroider uses this recently revealed structure to speculate about the
possibility of quantum coherence in the ion channels. Bernroider and co-author
Sisir Roy's calculations suggested to them that the behaviour of the ions in
the K channel could only be understood at the quantum level. Taking this as
their starting point, they then ask whether the structure of the ion channel
can be related to logic states. Further calculations lead them to suggest that
the K+ ions and the oxygen atoms of the binding pockets are two quantum-
entangled sub-systems, which they then equate to a quantum computational
mapping. The ions that are destined to be expelled from the channel are
proposed to encode information about the state of the oxygen atoms. It is
further proposed the separate ion channels could be quantum entangled with one
another.

### [edit] David Chalmers

The philosopher David Chalmers has speculated on a number of ways in which
quantum mechanics might relate to consciousness.

> One possibility is that instead of postulating novel properties, physics
might end up appealing to consciousness itself, in the way that some theorists
but not all, hold that quantum mechanics does. [14]

> The collapse dynamics leaves a door wide open for an interactionist
interpretation. [15]

> The most promising version of such an interpretation allows conscious states
to be correlated with the total quantum state of a system, with the extra
constraint that conscious states (unlike physical states) can never be
superposed. In a conscious physical system such as a brain, the physical and
phenomenal states of the system will be correlated in a (nonsuperposed)
quantum state. Upon observation of a superposed external system, SchrÃ¶dinger
evolution at the moment of observation would cause the observed system to
become correlated with the brain, yielding a resulting superposition of brain
states and so (by psychophysical correlation) a superposition of conscious
states. But such a superposition cannot occur, so one of the potential
resulting conscious states is somehow selected (presumably by a
nondeterministic dynamic principle at the phenomenal level). The result is
that (by psychophysical correlation) a definite brain state and a definite
state of the observed object are also selected. [16]

> If physics is supposed to rule out interactionism, then careful attention to
the detail of physical theory is required. [17]

### [edit] Roger Penrose

In The Emperor's New Mind and Shadows of the Mind, Penrose argues that

1\. Humans have abilities, particularly mathematical ones, that no algorithmic
computer (specifically Turing machine) could have, because computers are
limited by GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem. In other words, he believes humans
are hypercomputers. (The argument was originally due to John Lucas.)

GÃ¶del demonstrated that with any recursively enumerable set of axioms capable
of expressing Peano arithmetic, it was possible to produce a statement that
was obviously true, but could not be proved by the axioms. The theorem enjoys
general acceptance in the mathematical community[18].

Penrose, however, built a further and highly controversial argument on this
theorem. He argued that the theorem showed that the brain had the ability to
go beyond what can be demonstrated by mathematical axioms, and therefore there
is something within the functioning of the brain that is not based on an
algorithm (a system of calculations). A computer is just a system of
algorithms, and Penrose claimed that GÃ¶del's theorem demonstrated that brains
could perform functions that no computer could perform.

Penrose is not interested in explaining phenomenal consciousness, qualia,
generally regarded as the most mysterious feature of consciousness, but
instead focuses mainly on the cognitive powers of mathematicians.

These assertions have been vigorously contested by many critics and notably by
the philosophers Churchland and Grush[19][20]. The theory has been much
criticised [21] [22] [23].

2\. This would require some new physics. Penrose postulates that the currently
unknown process underlying quantum collapse supplies the non-algorithmic
element.

The random choice of, for instance, the position of a particle, which is
involved in the collapse of the wave function was the only physical process
that Penrose could find, which was not based on an algorithm. However,
randomness was not a promising basis for the quality of mathematical judgement
highlighted by his GÃ¶del theorem argument.

But Penrose went on to propose that when the wave function did not collapse as
a result of a measurement or decoherence in the environment, there could be an
alternative form of wave function collapse, which he called objective
reduction (OR). In this, each quantum superposition has its own space time
geometry. When these become separated by more than the Planck length, they are
affected by gravity, become unstable and collapse. OR is strikingly different
both from the traditional orthodoxy of Niels Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation
of quantum theory and from some more modern theories which avoid wave function
collapse altogether such as Many-worlds interpretation or some forms of
Quantum decoherence theory.

Penrose further proposes that OR is neither random nor governed by an
algorithm, but is 'non-computational', selecting information embedded in the
fundamental level of space time geometry.

3\. Collapse requires a coherent superposed state to work on. Penrose borrows
Stuart Hameroff's proposal about microtubules to supply this.

Initially, Penrose had lacked any detailed proposals for how OR could occur in
the brain. Later on cooperation with Stuart Hameroff [24] supplied this side
of the theory. Microtubules were central to Hameroff's proposals. These are
the core element of the cytoskeleton, which provides a supportive structure
and performs various functions in body cells. In additions to these functions,
it was now proposed that the microtubules could support macroscopic quantum
features known as Bose-Einstein condensates. It was also suggested that these
condensates could link with other neurons via gap junctions. This is claimed
to permit quantum coherence to extend over a large area of the brain. It is
suggested that when one of these areas of quantum coherence collapses, there
is an instance of consciousness, and the brain has access to a non-
computational process embedded in the fundamental level of space time
geometry.

At the same time, it was postulated that conventional synaptic activity
influences and is influenced by the activity in the microtubules. This part of
the process is referred to as 'orchestration' hence the theory is called
Orchestrated Objective Reduction or more commonly Orch OR.

Hameroff's proposals like those of Penrose attracted much criticism. However
the most cogent attack on Orch OR and quantum mind theories in general was the
view that conditions in the brain would lead to any quantum coherence
decohering too quickly for it to be relevant to neural processes. This general
criticism is discussed in the Science section below.

### [edit] Evan Harris Walker

Information theory is concerned with the capacity to contain or carry
information. Is there such a thing as a conscious field and a conscious
channel capacity?

Information theory is concerned with the measurement of information in terms
of logarithmic probabilityâhow many bits of information does it take to
represent a certain type of information such as, letâs say, the letter
âTâ in print. Since we donât know all the possible permutations or
âcombinationsâ of such a question we use statistical probability in order
to be very accurate in our measurements. We add up all the logarithmic
contributions of each possible symbol being measured in terms of its chance of
occurrence. It is expressed as logâP. This gives us an informational field
potential.

A brilliant physicist, Evan Harris Walker developed a sound scientific theory
about how the brain might, at quantum levels, process information. In his
book, The Physics of Consciousness, he adds logâP to SchrÃ¶dingerâs
equation. What he demonstrates mathematically is that when information is
measured by consciousness and will channel capacities in terms of a closed
loop, it forces one real solution only when one probable state happens and all
other possible states disappear. He offers/proposes physical evidence that
this process is occurring in the brain.

### [edit] Henry Stapp

Physically, Henry Stapp's approach is aligned with objective collapse theory,
in that the deterministic evolution of the wave function, and its
indeterministic collapse are seen as two real and ontologically distinct
phenomena. Collapse events occurring within the brain â the mind's
observation or measurement of the brain â are particularly important. Since
Stapp sees collapse as a mental process and the deterministic evolution of
brain states as physical, his approach is philosophically aligned with
interactionist dualism. The process by which collapse selects an actuality
from a set of possibilities is seen by Stapp as literally a process of choice,
and not merely a random dice-throw. His approach has implications with regard
to time. Since the future depends on decisions in the present, it is not pre-
existing, as in the block universe theory; rather there is an evolving
universe in which subjects participate, as in Whitehead's metaphysics. [25]

Stapp envisages consciousness as exercising top-level control over neural
excitation in the brain. Quantum brain events are suggested to occur at the
whole brain level, and are seen as being selected from the large-scale
excitation of the brain. The neural excitations are viewed as a code, and each
conscious experience as a selection from this code. The brain, in this theory,
is proposed to be a self-programming computer with a self-sustaining input
from memory, which is itself a code derived from previous experience. This
process results in a number of probabilities from which consciousness has to
select. The conscious act is a selection of a piece of top-level code, which
then exercises ongoing control over the flow of neural excitation. This
process refers to the top levels of brain activity involved with information
gathering, planning and the monitoring of the execution of plans. Conscious
events are proposed to be capable of grasping a whole pattern of activity,
thus accounting for the unity of consciousness, and providing a solution to
the 'binding problem'.

Stapp's version of the conscious brain is proposed to be a system that is
internally determined in a way that cannot be represented outside the system,
whereas for the rest of the physical universe an external representation plus
a knowledge of the laws of physics allows an accurate prediction of future
events.

Stapp proposes that the proof of his theory requires the identification of the
neurons that provide the top-level code and also the process by which memory
is turned into additional top-level code.

### [edit] Quantum Brain Dynamics

The ideas behind QBD derived originally from the physicists, Hiroomi
Umezawa[26], and Herbert Frohlich[27] in the 1960s. In recent decades these
ideas have been elaborated and given greater prominence by younger physicists
such as Mari Jibu[28], Kunio Yasue[29] and Giuseppe Vitiello[30]. In quantum
brain dynamics (QBD), the electrical dipoles of the water molecules that
constitute 70% of the brain are proposed to constitute a quantum field, known
here as the cortical field. The quanta of this field are described as
corticons. In the theory, this field interacts with quantum coherent waves
generated by biomolecules in the neurons and propagating along the neuronal
network.

Frohlich is the source of the idea that quantum coherent waves could be
generated in the neuronal network. Frohlich argued that it was not clear how
order could be sustained in living systems given the disruptive influence of
the fluctuations in biochemical processes. He viewed the electric potential
across the neuron membrane as the observable feature of some form of
underlying quantum order. His studies claimed to show that with an oscillating
charge in a thermal bath, large numbers of quanta may condense into a single
state known as a Bose condensate. This state allows long-range correlation
amongst the dipoles involved. Further to this, biomolecules were proposed to
line up along actin filaments (part of the cytoskeleton) and dipole
oscillations propagate along the filaments as quantum coherent waves. This now
has some experimental support in the form of confirmation that biomolecules
with high electric dipole moment have been shown to have a periodic
oscillation[31]. Vitiello also argues that the ordered chains of chemical
reactions on which biological tissues depend would collapse without some form
of quantum ordering, which in QBD is described by quantum field theory rather
than quantum mechanics.

Vitiello provides citations, which are claimed to support his view of
biological tissue. These include studies of radiation effect on cell
growth[32],response to external stimuli[33], non-linear
tunnelling[34],coherent nuclear motion in membrane proteins[35],optical
coherence in biological systems[36], energy transfer via solitons and coherent
excitations[37].

QBD proposes that the cortical field not only interacts with, but also to a
good extent controls the neuronal network. It suggests that biomolecular waves
propagate along the actin filaments in the area of the cell membranes and
dendritic spines. The waves derive energy from ATP molecules stored in the
cell membrane and control the ion channels, which in turn regulate the flow of
signals to the synapses. Vitiello claims that QBD does not require quantum
oscillations to last as long as the actual time to decoherence.

The proponents of QBD differ somewhat as the exact way in which it produces
consciousness. Jibu and Yasue think that the interaction between the energy
quanta of the cortical field and the biomolecular waves of the neuronal
network, particularly the dendritic part of the network, is what produces
consciousness. On the other hand, Vitiello thinks that the quantum states
involved in QBD produce two poles, a subjective representation of the external
world and a self. This self opens itself to the representation of the external
world. Consciousness is, in this theory, not in either the self or the
external representation, but between the two in the opening of one to the
other.

### [edit] Quantum Evidence

Concerning the question where quantum events could be effective in the complex
cortical structure and brain dynamics, it is outlined that professors
Friedrich Beck and John C. Eccles developed a model for quantal emission
process at the synaptic cleft with reasonable results. These authors also
discussed in detail the problem of elementary microscopic processes in protein
complexes able to survive thermal fluctuations. Quantum evidence was also
reached by the physicist Evan Harris Walker. Under the mental-psychological
profile, in years from 2003 to 2009, the professors Elio Conte, Andrei Yuri
Khrennikov, Orlando Todarello, Antonio Federici, Joseph P. Zbilut, have
performed a number of experiments reaching evidence on possible existence of
quantum interference effects on mental states during human perception and
cognition of ambiguous figures. See further reading[13, 14, 15, 16]. These
authors have also realized theoretical contributions on the analysis of
quantum interference effects in mental states, and on time dynamics of
cognitive entities[13, 14, 15, 16].

Physicists at the University of California, Berkeley believe they have
discovered that green plants perform quantum computation in order to capture
the sun's light through photosynthesis -- evidence of quantum coherence in a
living system.[38] Stuart Hameroff noted, in October 2000, that quantum
coherence -- although, by its mere occurrence in the brain not sufficient to
prove its supposed central role in consciousness -- had nevertheless been
observed. This, he claimed, was significant because so much of the criticism
of his model had "come under sharp criticism due to the issue of decoherence,
and the question of whether quantum processes of significance can exist in the
brain at physiological temperature." (Quantum Mind archives, October 2000 -
(11.))

## [edit] Ongoing Debate

### [edit] Science

The main argument against the quantum mind proposition is that the structures
of the brain are much too large for quantum effects to be important. It is
impossible for coherent quantum states to form for very long in the brain and
impossible for them to exist at scales on the order of the size of neurons.
Price, for example, says that quantum effects rarely or never affect human
decisions and that classical physics determines the behaviour of Neurons.

> In quantum terms each neuron is an essentially classical object.
Consequently quantum noise in the brain is at such a low level that it
probably doesn't often alter, except very rarely, the critical mechanistic
behaviour of sufficient neurons to cause a decision to be different than we
might otherwise expect. (...)

> âMichael Clive Price[1]

This does not imply that classical mechanics can explain consciousness, but
that quantum effects including superposition and entanglement are
insignificant.

One well-known critic of the quantum mind is Max Tegmark. Based on his
calculations, Tegmark concluded that quantum systems in the brain decohere
quickly and cannot control brain function, "This conclusion disagrees with
suggestions by Penrose and others that the brain acts as a quantum computer,
and that quantum coherence is related to consciousness in a fundamental
way"[39]

Proponents of quantum consciousness theories have sought to defend them
against Tegmark's criticism. In respect of QBD, Vitiello has argued that
Tegmark's work applies to theories based on quantum mechanics but not to those
such as QBD that are based on quantum field theory. In respect of Penrose and
Hameroff's Orch OR theory, Hameroff along with Hagan and Tuszynski replied to
Tegmark[40]. They claimed that Tegmark based his calculations on a model that
was different from Orch OR. It is argued that in the Orch OR model the
microtubules are shielded from decoherence by ordered water. Energy pumping as
a result of thermal disequilibrium, Debye layer screening and quantum error
correction, deriving from the geometry of the microtubule lattice are also
proposed as possible sources of shielding. Similarly, in his extension of
Bohm's ideas, Bernroider has claimed that the binding pockets in the ion
selection filters could protect against decoherence[41]. So far, however,
there has been no experimental confirmation of the ability of the features
mentioned above to protect against decoherence.

### [edit] Philosophy

Another line of criticism is that no physical theory is well suited to
explaining consciousness, particularly in its most problematical form,
phenomenal consciousness or qualia, known as the hard problem of
consciousness. It is not so much that colours and tastes and feelingsâqualia
or secondary qualitiesâhave been deliberately banished, but more that they
cannot be captured in any mathematical description, which means they cannot be
explicitly represented in physics, since all physical theory is expressed in
mathematical language (as explained in Eugene Wigner's famous paper The
Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences). If no
physical theory can express qualia, no physical theory can fully explain
consciousness. Replacing the mathematical apparatus of classical physics with
the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics is therefore of no help in
understanding consciousness, and indeed there is no known example of a quantum
equation which encapsulates a taste or colour.

As David Chalmers puts it:

> Nevertheless, quantum theories of consciousness suffer from the same
difficulties as neural or computational theories. Quantum phenomena have some
remarkable functional properties, such as nondeterminism and nonlocality. It
is natural to speculate that these properties may play some role in the
explanation of cognitive functions, such as random choice and the integration
of information, and this hypothesis cannot be ruled out a priori. But when it
comes to the explanation of experience, quantum processes are in the same boat
as any other. The question of why these processes should give rise to
experience is entirely unanswered. [2]

Other philosophers, such as Patricia and Paul Churchland and Daniel
Dennett[42] reject the idea that there is anything puzzling about
consciousness in the first place.
