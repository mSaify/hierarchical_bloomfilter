The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory of three of the four known
fundamental interactions and the elementary particles that take part in these
interactions. These particles make up all visible matter in the universe. The
standard model is a gauge theory of the electroweak and strong interactions
with the gauge group SU(3)ÃSU(2)ÃU(1).

Numerous experiments carried out since the mid-20th century have yielded
findings consistent with the Standard Model. The Standard Model falls short of
being a complete theory of fundamental interactions because it does not
include gravity and because it is incompatible with the recent observation of
neutrino oscillations.

## [edit] Historical background

The first step towards the Standard Model was Sheldon Glashow's discovery, in
1963, of a way to combine the electromagnetic and weak interactions. In 1967,
Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam incorporated the Higgs mechanism into
Glashow's electroweak theory, giving it its modern form.[1][2] The Higgs
mechanism is also believed to give rise to the rest masses of all the
elementary particles the Standard Model accounts for, the W and Z bosons, and
the fermions, the latter broken down into quarks and leptons.

After the discovery at CERN of neutral weak currents,[3][4][5][6] caused by Z
boson exchange, the electroweak theory became widely accepted. Glashow, Salam,
and Weinberg shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the
electroweak theory. The W and Z bosons were discovered experimentally in 1981,
and their masses were found to be as the Standard Model predicted.

The theory of the strong interaction, to which many contributed, acquired its
modern form around 1973-74, when experiments confirmed that the hadrons were
composed of fractionally charged quarks.

## [edit] Overview

At present, matter and energy are best understood in terms of the kinematics
and interactions of elementary particles. To date, physics has reduced the
laws governing the behavior and interaction of all known forms of matter and
energy, to a small set of fundamental laws and theories. A major goal of
physics is to find the "common ground" that would unite all of these theories
into one integrated theory of everything, of which all the other known laws
would be special cases, and from which the behavior of all matter and energy
could be derived (at least in principle). "Details can be worked out if the
situation is simple enough for us to make an approximation, which is almost
never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening." (Feynman's
lectures on Physics, Vol 1. 2â7)

The Standard Model groups two major extant theories â quantum electroweak
and quantum chromodynamics â into an internally consistent theory describing
the interactions between all experimentally observed particles. The Standard
Model describes each type of particle in terms of a mathematical field, via
quantum field theory. For a technical description of these fields and their
interactions, see Standard Model (mathematical formulation).

## [edit] Particle content

### [edit] Elementary particles: fermions

In the Standard Model, fermions are defined as elementary particles having
spin-1â2, and that respect the Pauli Exclusion Principle in accordance with
the spin-statistics theorem. There are 12 known fermions, each with a
corresponding antiparticle. They are classified according to how they interact
(or equivalently, by what charges they carry). There are six quarks (up, down,
charm, strange, top, bottom), and six leptons (electron, muon, tauon, and
their corresponding neutrinos).

Organization of Fermions Charge First generation Second generation Third
generation  
Quarks +2â3 Up  
u Charm  
c Top  
t  
â1â3 Down  
d Strange  
s Bottom  
b  
Leptons â1 Electron eâ Muon Î¼â Tauon Ïâ  
0 Electron neutrino Î½e Muon neutrino Î½Î¼ Tauon neutrino Î½Ï  
Pairs from each classification are grouped together to form a generation, with
corresponding particles exhibiting similar physical behavior (see table at
right).

The defining property of the quarks is that they carry color charge, and
hence, interact via the strong force. The infrared confining behavior of the
strong force results in quarks being perpetually (or at least since very soon
after the start of the big bang) bound to one another, forming color-neutral
composite particles (hadrons) containing either a quark and an antiquark
(mesons) or three quarks (baryons). The familiar proton and the neutron are
the two baryons having the smallest mass. Quarks also carry electric charge
and weak isospin. Hence they interact with other fermions both
electromagnetically and via the weak nuclear interaction.

The remaining six fermions do not carry color charge and are called leptons.
The three neutrinos do not carry electric charge either, so their motion is
directly influenced only by the weak nuclear force, which makes them
notoriously difficult to detect. However, by virtue of carrying an electric
charge, the electron, muon and the tauon interact electromagnetically.

Each member of a generation has greater mass than the corresponding particles
of lower generations. The first generation charged particles do not decay;
hence all ordinary (baryonic) matter is made of such particles. Specifically,
all atoms consist of electrons orbiting atomic nuclei ultimately constituted
of up and down quarks. Second and third generations charged particles, on the
other hand, decay with very short half lives, and are observed only in very
high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay and
pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.

### [edit] Force mediating particles

<IMG>

<IMG>

Summary of interactions between particles described by the Standard Model.

Forces in physics are the ways that particles interact and influence each
other. At a macro level, the electromagnetic force allows particles to
interact with one another via electric and magnetic fields, and the force of
gravitation allows two particles with mass to attract one another in
accordance with Newton's Law of Gravitation. The standard model explains such
forces as resulting from matter particles exchanging other particles, known as
force mediating particles. When a force mediating particle is exchanged, at a
macro level the effect is equivalent to a force influencing both of them, and
the particle is therefore said to have mediated (i.e., been the agent of) that
force. Force mediating particles are believed to be the reason why the forces
and interactions between particles observed in the laboratory and in the
universe exist.

The known force mediating particles described by the Standard Model also all
have spin (as do matter particles), but in their case, the value of the spin
is 1, meaning that all force mediating particles are bosons. As a result, they
do not follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The different types of force
mediating particles are described below.

  * Photons mediate the electromagnetic force between electrically charged particles. The photon is massless and is well-described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics.

  * The W+, Wâ, and Z gauge bosons mediate the weak interactions between particles of different flavors (all quarks and leptons). They are massive, with the Z being more massive than the WÂ±. The weak interactions involving the WÂ± act on exclusively left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. Furthermore, the WÂ± carry an electric charge of +1 and â1 and couple to the electromagnetic interactions. The electrically neutral Z boson interacts with both left-handed particles and antiparticles. These three gauge bosons along with the photons are grouped together which collectively mediate the electroweak interactions.

  * The eight gluons mediate the strong interactions between color charged particles (the quarks). Gluons are massless. The eightfold multiplicity of gluons is labeled by a combination of color and an anticolor charge (e.g., redâantigreen).[7] Because the gluon has an effective color charge, they can interact among themselves. The gluons and their interactions are described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.

The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are
summarized by the diagram at the top of this section.

### [edit] The Higgs boson

Main article: Higgs boson

The Higgs particle is a massive scalar elementary particle predicted by the
Standard Model. It has no intrinsic spin, and for that reason is classified as
a boson (like the force mediating particles, which have integer spin). Because
an exceptionally large amount of energy and beam luminosity are required to
create a Higgs boson in high energy colliders, it is the only fundamental
particle predicted by the Standard Model that has yet to be observed.

The Higgs boson plays a unique role in the Standard Model, by explaining why
the other elementary particles, the photon and gluon excepted, are massive. In
particular, the Higgs boson would explain why the photon has no mass, while
the W and Z bosons are very heavy. Elementary particle masses, and the
differences between electromagnetism (mediated by the photon) and the weak
force (mediated by the W and Z bosons), are critical to many aspects of the
structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In electroweak
theory, the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon,
and tauon) and quarks.

As yet, no experiment has directly detected the existence of the Higgs boson,
but there is some indirect evidence for it. It is hoped that the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN will confirm the existence of this particle.

Chien-Peng Yuan et al. believe that the Higgs boson may have been produced but
overlooked:

> "...experimenters may have already overlooked a Higgs particle, argues
theorist Chien-Peng Yuan of Michigan State University in East Lansing and his
colleagues. They considered the simplest possible supersymmetric theory.
Ordinarily, theorists assume that the lightest of theory's five Higgses is the
one that drags on the W and Z. Those interactions then feed back on Higgs and
push its mass above 121 times the mass of the proton, the highest mass
searched for at CERN's Large ElectronâPositron (LEP) collider, which ran
from 1989 to 2000. But it's possible that the lightest Higgs weighs as little
as 65 times the mass of a proton and has been missed, Yuan and colleagues
argue in a paper to be published in Physical Review Letters."[8]

## [edit] Field content

The standard model has the following fields:

### [edit] Spin 1

  1. A U(1) gauge field B_{\\mu\\nu}\\, with coupling g'\\, (weak U(1) or weak hypercharge)
  2. An SU(2) gauge field W_{\\mu\\nu}\\, with coupling g\\, (weak SU(2) or weak isospin)
  3. An SU(3) gauge field G_{\\mu\\nu}\\, with coupling g_s\\, (strong SU(3) or color)

### [edit] Spin 1/2

The spin 1/2 particles are in representations of the gauge groups. For the
U(1) group, we list the value of the weak hypercharge instead.

The left-handed fermionic fields are:

  1. An SU(3) singlet, SU(2) doublet with U(1) weak hypercharge â1 (left-handed lepton)
  2. An SU(3) singlet, SU(2) singlet with U(1) weak hypercharge 2 (left-handed antilepton)
  3. An SU(3) triplet, SU(2) doublet, with U(1) weak hypercharge 1â3 (left-handed quarks)
  4. An SU(3) triplet, SU(2) singlet, with U(1) weak hypercharge â4â3 (left-handed up-type antiquark)
  5. An SU(3) triplet, SU(2) singlet, with U(1) weak hypercharge 2â3 (left-handed down-type antiquark)

By CPT symmetry, there is a set of right-handed fermions with the opposite
quantum numbers.

This describes one generation of leptons and quarks, and there are three
generations, so there are three copies of each field. Note that there are
twice as many left-handed lepton field components as left-handed antilepton
field components in each generation, but an equal number of left-handed quark
and antiquark fields.

### [edit] Spin 0

  1. An SU(2) doublet H with U(1) hyper-charge â1 (Higgs field)

note that | H | 2, summed over the two SU(2) components, is invariant under
both SU(2) and under U(1), and so it can appear as a renormalizable term in
the Lagrangian, as can its square.

This field acquires a vacuum expectation value, leaving a combination of the
weak isospin and hypercharge unbroken. This is the electromagnetic gauge
group, and the photon remains massless. The standard formula for the electric
charge (which defines the normalization of the weak hypercharge, which would
otherwise be somewhat arbitrary) is:

    
     q = I_z + {Y\\over 2}
Beware that the normalization q = Iz \+ Y sometimes is also used.

### [edit] Lagrangian

The Lagrangian for the spin 1 and spin 1/2 fields is the most general
renormalizable gauge field Lagrangian with no fine tunings:

Spin 1: \\int - {1\\over 4} B_{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\mu\\nu} - {1\\over
4}\\mathrm{tr} W_{\\mu\\nu}W^{\\mu\\nu} - {1\\over 4} \\mathrm{tr}G_{\\mu\\nu}
G^{\\mu\\nu}

where the traces are over the SU(2) and SU(3) indices hidden in W and G
respectively. The two-index objects are the field strengths derived from W and
G the vector fields. There are also two extra hidden parameters: the theta
angles for SU(2) and SU(3).

Note that the spin 1/2 particles can have no mass terms, because there is no
right/left helicity pair with the same SU(2) and SU(3) representation and the
same weak hypercharge. This means that if the gauge charges were conserved in
the vacuum, none of the spin 1/2 particles could ever swap helicity, and they
would all be massless.

For a neutral fermion, for example, a hypothetical right-handed lepton N, or
NÎ± in relativistic two-spinor notation, with no SU(3),SU(2) representation
and zero charge, it is possible to add the term:

    
    \\int M N^\\alpha N^\\beta \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta} + \\bar{N_\\dot{\\alpha}}\\bar{N_\\dot{\\beta}}\\epsilon^{\\dot\\alpha\\dot\\beta} 
and this term gives the neutral fermion a Majorana mass. Since the generic
value for M will be of order 1, such a particle would generically be
unacceptably heavy.

Note that the interactions are completely determined by the theory â the
leptons introduce no extra parameters.

### [edit] Higgs mechanism

Main article: Higgs mechanism

The Lagrangian for the Higgs includes the most general renormalizable self
interaction:

    
    S_{\\mathrm{Higgs}} = \\int d^4x\\left\[\(D_\\mu H\)^*\(D^\\mu H\) + \\lambda\(|H|^2 - v^2\)^2\\right\]
The parameter v2 has dimensions of mass squared, and it gives the location
where the classical Lagrangian is at a minimum. In order for the Higgs
mechanism to work, v2 must be a positive number. v has units of mass, and it
is the only parameter in the standard model which is not dimensionless. It is
also much smaller than the Planck scale, it is approximately equal to the
Higgs mass and sets the scale for the mass of everything else. This is the
only real fine-tuning to a small nonzero value in the standard model, and it
is called the Hierarchy problem.

It is traditional to choose the SU(2) gauge so that the Higgs doublet in the
vacuum has expectation value (v,0).

### [edit] Masses and CKM matrix

The rest of the interactions are the most general spin-0 spin-1â2 Yukawa
interactions, and there are many of these. These constitute most of the free
parameters in the model. The Yukawa couplings generate the masses and mixings
once the Higgs gets its vacuum expectation value.

The terms L * HR generate a mass term for each of the three generations of
leptons. There are 9 of these terms, but by relabeling L and R, the matrix can
be diagonalized. Since only the upper component of H is nonzero, the upper
SU(2) component of L mixes with R to make the electron, the muon, and the
tauon, leaving over a lower massless component, the neutrino.

The terms QHU generate up masses, while QHD generate down masses. But since
there is more than one right-handed singlet in each generation, it is not
possible to diagonalize both with a good basis for the fields, and there is an
extra CKM matrix.

Technically, quantum field theory provides the mathematical framework for the
standard model, in which a Lagrangian controls the dynamics and kinematics of
the theory. Each kind of particle is described in terms of a dynamical field
that pervades space-time. The construction of the standard model proceeds
following the modern method of constructing most field theories: by first
postulating a set of symmetries of the system, and then by writing down the
most general renormalizable Lagrangian from its particle (field) content that
observes these symmetries.

The global PoincarÃ© symmetry is postulated for all relativistic quantum field
theories. It consists of the familiar translational symmetry, rotational
symmetry and the inertial reference frame invariance central to the theory of
special relativity. The local SU(3)\\timesSU(2)\\timesU(1) gauge symmetry is
an internal symmetry that essentially defines the standard model. Roughly, the
three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental
interactions. The fields fall into different representations of the various
symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing the most
general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depend on 19 parameters, whose
numerical values are established by experiment. The parameters are summarized
in the table at right.

#### [edit] The QCD sector

where BÎ¼ is the U(1) gauge field; YW is the weak hypercharge â the
generator of the U(1) group; \\vec{W}_\\mu is the three-component SU(2) gauge
field; \\vec{\\tau}_L are the Pauli matrices â infinitesimal generators of
the SU(2) group, the subscript L indicates that they only act on left
fermions; g^\\prime and g are coupling constants.

#### [edit] The Higgs sector

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a complex spinor of the group
SU(2)L:

    
\\varphi={1\\over\\sqrt{2}}

\\left\(

\\begin{array}{c}

\\varphi^+ \\\\ \\varphi^0

\\end{array}

\\right\)\\;,

where the indexes + and 0 indicate the Q-charges of the components. The YW-
charge of both components is 1.

Before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is:

\\mathcal{L}_H = \\varphi^\\dagger

\\left\({\\partial_\\mu}-

{i\\over2} \\left\( g'Y_WB_\\mu + g\\vec\\tau\\vec W_\\mu \\right\)\\right\)

{\\lambda^2\\over4}\\left\(\\varphi^\\dagger\\varphi-v^2\\right\)^2\\;,

for which you may also find the following abbreviation:

\\mathcal{L}_H = \\left|

\\left\(\\partial_\\mu + {i\\over2} \\left\( g'Y_WB_\\mu

+g\\vec\\tau\\vec W_\\mu \\right\)\\right\)\\varphi\\right|^2 \\ - \\
{\\lambda^2\\over4}\\left\(\\varphi^\\dagger\\varphi-v^2\\right\)^2\\;.

### [edit] Additional symmetries of the Standard Model

From the theoretical point of view, the Standard Model exhibits four
additional global symmetries, not postulated at the outset of its
construction, collectively denoted accidental symmetries, which are continuous
U(1) global symmetries. The transformations leaving the Lagrangian invariant
are:

    \\psi_\\text{q}\(x\)\\rightarrow e^{i\\alpha/3}\\psi_\\text{q}
    E_L\\rightarrow e^{i\\beta}E_L\\text{ and }\(e_R\)^c\\rightarrow  e^{i\\beta}\(e_R\)^c
    M_L\\rightarrow  e^{i\\beta}M_L\\text{ and }\(\\mu_R\)^c\\rightarrow  e^{i\\beta}\(\\mu_R\)^c
    T_L\\rightarrow  e^{i\\beta}T_L\\text{ and }\(\\tau_R\)^c\\rightarrow e^{i\\beta}\(\\tau_R\)^c.
The first transformation rule is shorthand meaning that all quark fields for
all generations must be rotated by an identical phase simultaneously. The
fields ML, TL and (Î¼R)c, (ÏR)c are the 2nd (muon) and 3rd (tauon) generation
analogs of EL and (eR)c fields.

By Noether's theorem, each symmetry above has an associated conservation law:
the conservation of baryon number, electron number, muon number, and tauon
number. Each quark is assigned a baryon number of 1/3, while each antiquark is
assigned a baryon number of -1/3. Conservation of baryon number implies that
the number of quarks minus the number of antiquarks is a constant. Within
experimental limits, no violation of this conservation law has been found.

Similarly, each electron and its associated neutrino is assigned an electron
number of +1, while the antielectron and the associated antineutrino carry
â1 electron number. Similarly, the muons and their neutrinos are assigned a
muon number of +1 and the tau leptons are assigned a tau lepton number of +1.
The Standard Model predicts that each of these three numbers should be
conserved separately in a manner similar to the way baryon number is
conserved. These numbers are collectively known as lepton family numbers (LF).
Symmetry works differently for quarks than for leptons, mainly because the
Standard Model predicts that neutrinos are massless. However, it was recently
found that neutrinos have small masses and oscillate between flavors,
signaling that the conservation of lepton family number is violated.

In addition to the accidental (but exact) symmetries described above, the
Standard Model exhibits several approximate symmetries. These are the "SU(2)
custodial symmetry" and the "SU(2) or SU(3) quark flavor symmetry."

Notes:

  * * These are not ordinary abelian charges, which can be added together, but are labels of group representations of Lie groups.
  * ** Mass is really a coupling between a left-handed fermion and a right-handed fermion. For example, the mass of an electron is really a coupling between a left-handed electron and a right-handed electron, which is the antiparticle of a left-handed positron. Also neutrinos show large mixings in their mass coupling, so it's not accurate to talk about neutrino masses in the flavor basis or to suggest a left-handed electron antineutrino.
  * *** The masses of baryons and hadrons and various cross-sections are the experimentally measured quantities. Since quarks can't be isolated because of QCD confinement, the quantity here is supposed to be the mass of the quark at the renormalization scale of the QCD scale.
  * **** The Standard Model assumes that neutrinos are massless. However, several contemporary experiments prove that neutrinos oscillate between their flavour states, which could not happen if all were massless.[9] It is straightforward to extend the model to fit these data but there are many possibilities, so the mass eigenstates are still open. See Neutrino#Mass.

## [edit] Tests and predictions

The Standard Model (SM) predicted the existence of the W and Z bosons, gluon,
and the top and charm quarks before these particles were observed. Their
predicted properties were experimentally confirmed with good precision. To
give an idea of the success of the SM, the following table compares the
measured masses of the W and Z bosons with the masses predicted by the SM:

Quantity Measured (GeV) SM prediction (GeV)  
Mass of W boson 80.398Â±0.025 80.3900Â±0.0180  
Mass of Z boson 91.1876Â±0.0021 91.1874Â±0.0021  
The SM also makes several predictions about the decay of Z bosons, which have
been experimentally confirmed by the Large Electron-Positron Collider at CERN.

Unsolved problems in physics:  
What gives rise to the Standard Model of particle physics?  
Why do particle masses and coupling constants have the values that we measure?  
Does the Higgs boson really exist?  
Why are there three generations of particles?

There is some experimental evidence consistent with neutrinos having mass,
which the Standard Model does not allow. To accommodate such findings, the
Standard Model can be modified by adding a non-renormalizable interaction of
lepton fields with the square of the Higgs field. This is natural in certain
grand unified theories, and if new physics appears at about 1016 GeV, the
neutrino masses are of the right order of magnitude.

Currently, there is one elementary particle predicted by the Standard Model
that has yet to be observed: the Higgs boson. A major reason for building the
Large Hadron Collider is that the high energies of which it is capable are
expected to make the Higgs observable. However, as of August 2008, there is
only indirect empirical evidence for the existence of the Higgs boson, so that
its discovery cannot be claimed.

A fair amount of theoretical and experimental research has attempted to extend
the Standard Model into a theory of everything, a complete theory explaining
all physical phenomena. Inadequacies of the Standard Model that motivate such
research 'Beyond the Standard Model' include:

  * Does not attempt to explain gravity, and there is no known way of adapting the quantum field theory of the sort the Standard Model employs freely, with general relativity, the canonical theory of gravity. This means, among other things, that we have no good theory for the very early universe;
  * Seems rather ad-hoc and inelegant, requiring 19 numerical constants whose values are unrelated and arbitrary. Although the Standard Model, as it now stands, cannot explain why neutrinos have masses (and the specifics of neutrino mass are still unclear), it is believed that explaining neutrino mass will require an additional 7 or 8 constants;
  * Gives rise to the hierarchy problem, namely why the weak scale and Planck scale are so disparate;
  * Should be modified so as to be consistent with the emerging "standard model of cosmology." Specifically, a truly satisfactory theory of the elementary particles and of the fundamental interactions must explain the initial conditions of the universe that gave rise to certain observed properties of the present-day universe, properties such as the predominance of matter over antimatter (matter/antimatter asymmetry), and its isotropy and homogeneity over large distances.
