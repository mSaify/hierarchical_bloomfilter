Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that is used in the social
sciences (most notably economics), biology, engineering, political science,
international relations, computer science, and philosophy. Game theory
attempts to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations, in which
an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others.
While initially developed to analyze competitions in which one individual does
better at another's expense (zero sum games), it has been expanded to treat a
wide class of interactions, which are classified according to several
criteria. Today, "game theory is a sort of umbrella or 'unified field' theory
for the rational side of social science, where 'social' is interpreted
broadly, to include human as well as non-human players (computers, animals,
plants)" (Aumann 1987).

Traditional applications of game theory attempt to find equilibria in these
games. In an equilibrium, each player of the game has adopted a strategy that
they are unlikely to change. Many equilibrium concepts have been developed
(most famously the Nash equilibrium) in an attempt to capture this idea. These
equilibrium concepts are motivated differently depending on the field of
application, although they often overlap or coincide. This methodology is not
without criticism, and debates continue over the appropriateness of particular
equilibrium concepts, the appropriateness of equilibria altogether, and the
usefulness of mathematical models more generally.

Although some developments occurred before it, the field of game theory came
into being with the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by John
von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. This theory was developed extensively in
the 1950s by many scholars. Game theory was later explicitly applied to
biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as
the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many
fields. Eight game theorists have won Nobel prizes in economics, and John
Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of game
theory to biology.

## [edit] Representation of games

See also: List of games in game theory

The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. A game
consists of a set of players, a set of moves (or strategies) available to
those players, and a specification of payoffs for each combination of
strategies. Most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic
function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define
noncooperative games.

### [edit] Extensive form

Main article: Extensive form game

<IMG>

<IMG>

An extensive form game

The extensive form can be used to formalize games with some important order.
Games here are often presented as trees (as pictured to the left). Here each
vertex (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is
specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex
represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the
bottom of the tree.

In the game pictured here, there are two players. Player 1 moves first and
chooses either F or U. Player 2 sees Player 1's move and then chooses A or R.
Suppose that Player 1 chooses U and then Player 2 chooses A, then Player 1
gets 8 and Player 2 gets 2.

The extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with
imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects
different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set
(i.e., the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is
drawn around them.

### [edit] Normal form

Player 2  
chooses Left Player 2  
chooses Right  
Player 1  
chooses Up 4, 3 â1, â1  
Player 1  
chooses Down 0, 0 3, 4  
Normal form or payoff matrix of a 2-player, 2-strategy game  
Main article: Normal-form game

The normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a matrix which
shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right).
More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff
for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the
accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other
chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the
number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the
interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1
in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in
our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays Up and that Player 2 plays Left.
Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.

When a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts
simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If
players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is
usually presented in extensive form.

### [edit] Characteristic function form

Main article: Cooperative game

In cooperative games with transferable utility no individual payoffs are
given. Instead, the characteristic function determines the payoff of each
coalition. The standard assumption is that the empty coalition obtains a
payoff of 0.

The origin of this form is to be found in the seminal book of von Neumann and
Morgenstern who, when studying coalitional normal form games, assumed that
when a coalition C forms, it plays against the complementary coalition
(N\\setminus C) as if they were playing a 2-player game. The equilibrium
payoff of C is characteristic. Now there are different models to derive
coalitional values from normal form games, but not all games in characteristic
function form can be derived from normal form games.

Formally, a characteristic function form game (also known as a TU-game) is
given as a pair (N,v), where N denotes a set of players and
v:2^N\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{R} is a characteristic function.

The characteristic function form has been generalised to games without the
assumption of transferable utility.

### [edit] Partition function form

The characteristic function form ignores the possible externalities of
coalition formation. In the partition function form the payoff of a coalition
depends not only on its members, but also on the way the rest of the players
are partitioned (Thrall & Lucas 1963).

## [edit] Application and challenges

Game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal
behaviors. It was initially developed in economics to understand a large
collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and
consumers. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and
game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological
behaviors as well.

Game theoretic analysis was initially used to study animal behavior by Ronald
Fisher in the 1930s (although even Charles Darwin makes a few informal game
theoretic statements). This work predates the name "game theory", but it
shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics
were later applied to biology largely by John Maynard Smith in his book
Evolution and the Theory of Games.

In addition to being used to predict and explain behavior, game theory has
also been used to attempt to develop theories of ethical or normative
behavior. In economics and philosophy, scholars have applied game theory to
help in the understanding of good or proper behavior. Game theoretic arguments
of this type can be found as far back as Plato.[1]

### [edit] Political science

The application of game theory to political science is focused in the
overlapping areas of fair division, political economy, public choice, positive
political theory, and social choice theory. In each of these areas,
researchers have developed game theoretic models in which the players are
often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.

For early examples of game theory applied to political science, see the work
of Anthony Downs. In his book An Economic Theory of Democracy (Downs 1957), he
applies a hotelling firm location model to the political process. In the
Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional
policy space. The theorist shows how the political candidates will converge to
the ideology preferred by the median voter. For more recent examples, see the
books by Steven Brams, George Tsebelis, Gene M. Grossman and Elhanan Helpman,
or David Austen-Smith and Jeffrey S. Banks.

A game-theoretic explanation for democratic peace is that public and open
debate in democracies send clear and reliable information regarding their
intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the
intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if
promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make
concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a nondemocracy
(Levy & Razin 2003).

### [edit] Economics and business

Economists have long used game theory to analyze a wide array of economic
phenomena, including auctions, bargaining, duopolies, fair division,
oligopolies, social network formation, and voting systems. This research
usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as equilibria in games.
These "solution concepts" are usually based on what is required by norms of
rationality. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the Nash
equilibrium. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a
best response to the other strategies. So, if all the players are playing the
strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to
deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are
doing.

The payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the utility of
individual players. Often in modeling situations the payoffs represent money,
which presumably corresponds to an individual's utility. This assumption,
however, can be faulty.

A prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game
that is an abstraction of some particular economic situation. One or more
solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets
in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one
might wonder to what use should this information be put. Economists and
business professors suggest two primary uses.

#### [edit] Descriptive

<IMG>

A three stage Centipede Game

The first known use is to inform us about how actual human populations behave.
Some scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict
how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations
analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has
come under recent criticism. First, it is criticized because the assumptions
made by game theorists are often violated. Game theorists may assume players
always act in a way to directly maximize their wins (the Homo economicus
model), but in practice, human behavior often deviates from this model.
Explanations of this phenomenon are many; irrationality, new models of
deliberation, or even different motives (like that of altruism). Game
theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in physics.
Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as
a reasonable scientific ideal akin to the models used by physicists. However,
additional criticism of this use of game theory has been levied because some
experiments have demonstrated that individuals do not play equilibrium
strategies. For instance, in the centipede game, guess 2/3 of the average
game, and the dictator game, people regularly do not play Nash equilibria.
There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments.[2]

Alternatively, some authors claim that Nash equilibria do not provide
predictions for human populations, but rather provide an explanation for why
populations that play Nash equilibria remain in that state. However, the
question of how populations reach those points remains open.

Some game theorists have turned to evolutionary game theory in order to
resolve these worries. These models presume either no rationality or bounded
rationality on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory
does not necessarily presume natural selection in the biological sense.
Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural
evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, fictitious play
dynamics).

#### [edit] Prescriptive or normative analysis

Cooperate Defect  
Cooperate -1, -1 -10, 0  
Defect 0, -10 -5, -5  
The Prisoner's Dilemma  
On the other hand, some scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for
the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to
behave. Since a Nash equilibrium of a game constitutes one's best response to
the actions of the other players, playing a strategy that is part of a Nash
equilibrium seems appropriate. However, this use for game theory has also come
under criticism. First, in some cases it is appropriate to play a non-
equilibrium strategy if one expects others to play non-equilibrium strategies
as well. For an example, see Guess 2/3 of the average.

Second, the Prisoner's dilemma presents another potential counterexample. In
the Prisoner's Dilemma, each player pursuing his own self-interest leads both
players to be worse off than had they not pursued their own self-interests.

### [edit] Biology

The hawk-dove game  
Unlike economics, the payoffs for games in biology are often interpreted as
corresponding to fitness. In addition, the focus has been less on equilibria
that correspond to a notion of rationality, but rather on ones that would be
maintained by evolutionary forces. The best known equilibrium in biology is
known as the evolutionarily stable strategy (or ESS), and was first introduced
in (Smith & Price 1973). Although its initial motivation did not involve any
of the mental requirements of the Nash equilibrium, every ESS is a Nash
equilibrium.

In biology, game theory has been used to understand many different phenomena.
It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate
1:1 sex ratios. (Fisher 1930) suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result
of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to
maximize their number of grandchildren.

Additionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and the ESS to
explain the emergence of animal communication (Harper & Maynard Smith 2003).
The analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided
some insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example,
the mobbing behavior of many species, in which a large number of prey animals
attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent
organization.

Biologists have used the hawk-dove game (also known as chicken) to analyze
fighting behavior and territoriality.

Maynard Smith, in the preface to Evolution and the Theory of Games, writes,
"[p]aradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied
to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally
designed". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly
incongruous phenomena in nature.[3]

One such phenomenon is known as biological altruism. This is a situation in
which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is
detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism
because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary
adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species
ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a
nightâs hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to
worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate,
to Vervet monkeys that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when
it endangers that individual's chance of survival.[4] All of these actions
increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the
individual.

Evolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of kin
selection. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor
relatives. Hamilton's rule explains the evolutionary reasoning behind this
selection with the equation c<b*r where the cost ( c ) to the altruist must be
less than the benefit ( b ) to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of
relatedness ( r ). The more closely related two organisms are causes the
incidence of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles.
This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its
close relative are passed on, (through survival of its offspring) can forgo
the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are
passed on. Helping a sibling for example, has a coefficient of Â½, because an
individual shares Â½ of the alleles in its siblingâs offspring. Ensuring
that enough of a siblingâs offspring survive to adulthood precludes the
necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.[4]

### [edit] Computer science and logic

Game theory has come to play an increasingly important role in logic and in
computer science. Several logical theories have a basis in game semantics. In
addition, computer scientists have used games to model interactive
computations. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of
multi-agent systems.

Separately, game theory has played a role in online algorithms. In particular,
the k-server problem, which has in the past been referred to as games with
moving costs and request-answer games (Ben David, Borodin & Karp et al. 1994).
Yao's principle is a game-theoretic technique for proving lower bounds on the
computational complexity of randomized algorithms, and especially of online
algorithms.

The field of algorithmic game theory combines computer science concepts of
complexity and algorithm design with game theory and economic theory. The
emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for
finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer
systems, and security and information markets.[5]

### [edit] Philosophy

Stag Hare  
Stag 3, 3 0, 2  
Hare 2, 0 2, 2  
Stag hunt  
Game theory has been put to several uses in philosophy. Responding to two
papers by W.V.O. Quine (1960, 1967), Lewis (1969) used game theory to develop
a philosophical account of convention. In so doing, he provided the first
analysis of common knowledge and employed it in analyzing play in coordination
games. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand meaning in
terms of signaling games. This later suggestion has been pursued by several
philosophers since Lewis (Skyrms (1996), Grim, Kokalis, and Alai-Tafti et al.
(2004)). Following Lewis (1969) game-theoretic account of conventions, Ullmann
Margalit (1977) and Bicchieri (2006) have developed theories of social norms
that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-
motive game into a coordination game.[6]

Game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive
epistemology: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or
knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social
outcomes resulting from agents' interactions. Philosophers who have worked in
this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),[7] Skyrms (1990),[8] and Stalnaker
(1999).[9]

In ethics, some authors have attempted to pursue the project, begun by Thomas
Hobbes, of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the
Prisoner's dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-
interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an
important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of
the general social contract view in political philosophy (for examples, see
Gauthier (1986) and Kavka (1986).[10]

Other authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to
explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding
animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the Prisoner's
dilemma, Stag hunt, and the Nash bargaining game as providing an explanation
for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., Skyrms (1996, 2004)
and Sober and Wilson (1999)).

Some assumptions used in some parts of game theory have been challenged in
philosophy; psychological egoism states that rationality reduces to self-
interestâa claim debated among philosophers. (see Psychological
egoism#Criticism)

## [edit] Types of games

### [edit] Cooperative or non-cooperative

Main articles: Cooperative game and Non-cooperative game

A game is cooperative if the players are able to form binding commitments. For
instance the legal system requires them to adhere to their promises. In
noncooperative games this is not possible.

Often it is assumed that communication among players is allowed in cooperative
games, but not in noncooperative ones. This classification on two binary
criteria has been rejected (Harsanyi 1974).

Of the two types of games, noncooperative games are able to model situations
to the finest details, producing accurate results. Cooperative games focus on
the game at large. Considerable efforts have been made to link the two
approaches. The so-called Nash-programme has already established many of the
cooperative solutions as noncooperative equilibria.

Hybrid games contain cooperative and non-cooperative elements. For instance,
coalitions of players are formed in a cooperative game, but these play in a
non-cooperative fashion.

### [edit] Symmetric and asymmetric

E F  
E 1, 2 0, 0  
F 0, 0 1, 2  
An asymmetric game  
Main article: Symmetric game

A symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy
depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. If
the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to
the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2Ã2
games are symmetric. The standard representations of chicken, the prisoner's
dilemma, and the stag hunt are all symmetric games. Some scholars would
consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However,
the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.

Most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical
strategy sets for both players. For instance, the ultimatum game and similarly
the dictator game have different strategies for each player. It is possible,
however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be
asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite
having identical strategy sets for both players.

### [edit] Zero-sum and non-zero-sum

A B  
A â1, 1 3, â3  
B 0, 0 â2, 2  
A zero-sum game  
Main article: Zero-sum (game theory)

Zero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by
players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum
games the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of
strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at
the equal expense of others). Poker exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the
possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's
opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include matching pennies and most
classical board games including Go and chess.

Many games studied by game theorists (including the famous prisoner's dilemma)
are non-zero-sum games, because some outcomes have net results greater or less
than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not
necessarily correspond with a loss by another.

Constant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not
to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential gains from
trade. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-
sum game by adding an additional dummy player (often called "the board"),
whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.

### [edit] Simultaneous and sequential

Main article: Sequential game

Simultaneous games are games where both players move simultaneously, or if
they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier
players' actions (making them effectively simultaneous). Sequential games (or
dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier
actions. This need not be perfect information about every action of earlier
players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know
that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while he does
not know which of the other available actions the first player actually
performed.

The difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the
different representations discussed above. Often, normal form is used to
represent simultaneous games, and extensive form is used to represent
sequential ones; although this isn't a strict rule in a technical sense.

### [edit] Perfect information and imperfect information

<IMG>

<IMG>

A game of imperfect information (the dotted line represents ignorance on the
part of player 2)

Main article: Perfect information

An important subset of sequential games consists of games of perfect
information. A game is one of perfect information if all players know the
moves previously made by all other players. Thus, only sequential games can be
games of perfect information, since in simultaneous games not every player
knows the actions of the others. Most games studied in game theory are
imperfect-information games, although there are some interesting examples of
perfect-information games, including the ultimatum game and centipede game.
Perfect-information games include also chess, go, mancala, and arimaa.

Perfect information is often confused with complete information, which is a
similar concept. Complete information requires that every player know the
strategies and payoffs of the other players but not necessarily the actions.

### [edit] Infinitely long games

Main article: Determinacy

Games, as studied by economists and real-world game players, are generally
finished in a finite number of moves. Pure mathematicians are not so
constrained, and set theorists in particular study games that last for an
infinite number of moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until
after all those moves are completed.

The focus of attention is usually not so much on what is the best way to play
such a game, but simply on whether one or the other player has a winning
strategy. (It can be proven, using the axiom of choice, that there are
gamesâeven with perfect information, and where the only outcomes are "win"
or "lose"âfor which neither player has a winning strategy.) The existence of
such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in
descriptive set theory.

### [edit] Discrete and continuous games

Much of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games, that have a
finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be
extended, however. Continuous games allow players to choose a strategy from a
continuous strategy set. For instance, Cournot competition is typically
modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including
fractional quantities.

Differential games such as the continuous pursuit and evasion game are
continuous games.

### [edit] One-player and many-player games

Individual decision problems are sometimes considered "one-player games".
While these situations are not game theoretical, they are modeled using many
of the same tools within the discipline of decision theory. It is only with
two or more players that a problem becomes game theoretical. A randomly acting
player who makes "chance moves", also known as "moves by nature", is often
added (Osborne & Rubinstein 1994). This player is not typically considered a
third player in what is otherwise a two player game, but merely serves to
provide a roll of the dice where required by the game. Games with an infinite
number of players are often called n-person games (Luce & Raiffa 1957).

### [edit] Metagames

These are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another
game, the target or subject game. Metagames seek to maximize the utility value
of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to mechanism
design theory.

## [edit] History

The first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by
James Waldegrave in 1713. In this letter, Waldegrave provides a minimax mixed
strategy solution to a two-person version of the card game le Her.

James Madison made what we now recognize as a game-theoretic analysis of the
ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of
taxation.[11][12]

It was not until the publication of Antoine Augustin Cournot's Recherches sur
les principes mathÃ©matiques de la thÃ©orie des richesses (Researches into the
Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth) in 1838 that a general game
theoretic analysis was pursued. In this work Cournot considers a duopoly and
presents a solution that is a restricted version of the Nash equilibrium.

Although Cournot's analysis is more general than Waldegrave's, game theory did
not really exist as a unique field until John von Neumann published a series
of papers in 1928. While the French mathematician Ãmile Borel did some
earlier work on games, Von Neumann can rightfully be credited as the inventor
of game theory. Von Neumann was a brilliant mathematician whose work was far-
reaching from set theory to his calculations that were key to development of
both the Atom and Hydrogen bombs and finally to his work developing computers.
Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in the 1944 book Theory of Games
and Economic Behavior by von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. This profound work
contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person
zero-sum games. During this time period, work on game theory was primarily
focused on cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for
groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them
about proper strategies.

In 1950, the first discussion of the prisoner's dilemma appeared, and an
experiment was undertaken on this game at the RAND corporation. Around this
same time, John Nash developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players'
strategies, known as Nash equilibrium, applicable to a wider variety of games
than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. This equilibrium
is sufficiently general, allowing for the analysis of non-cooperative games in
addition to cooperative ones.

Game theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which time
the concepts of the core, the extensive form game, fictitious play, repeated
games, and the Shapley value were developed. In addition, the first
applications of Game theory to philosophy and political science occurred
during this time.

In 1965, Reinhard Selten introduced his solution concept of subgame perfect
equilibria, which further refined the Nash equilibrium (later he would
introduce trembling hand perfection as well). In 1967, John Harsanyi developed
the concepts of complete information and Bayesian games. Nash, Selten and
Harsanyi became Economics Nobel Laureates in 1994 for their contributions to
economic game theory.

In the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in biology, largely as a
result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable
strategy. In addition, the concepts of correlated equilibrium, trembling hand
perfection, and common knowledge[13] were introduced and analysed.

In 2005, game theorists Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann followed Nash,
Selten and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models,
early examples of evolutionary game theory. Aumann contributed more to the
equilibrium school, introducing an equilibrium coarsening, correlated
equilibrium, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of
common knowledge and of its consequences.

In 2007, Roger Myerson, together with Leonid Hurwicz and Eric Maskin, was
awarded of the Nobel Prize in Economics "for having laid the foundations of
mechanism design theory." Among his contributions, is also the notion of
proper equilibrium, and an important graduate text: Game Theory, Analysis of
Conflict (Myerson 1997).
