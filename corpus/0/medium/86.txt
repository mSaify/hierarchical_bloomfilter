Craps is a dice game played against other players or a bank. (Though the game
is called "craps", an individual game of it is called a "crap game," never a
"craps game.") Craps developed from a simplification of the Old English game
hazard. Its origins are highly complex and may date to the Crusades, later
being influenced by French gamblers. What was to become the modern American
version of the game was brought to New Orleans by Bernard Xavier Philippe de
Marigny de Mandeville, scion of wealthy Louisiana landowners and a gambler and
politician.[1] The game, first known as crapaud (a French word meaning "toad")
reportedly owes its modern popularity from its being spread through the
African-American community [2].

In craps, players may wager money against each other (street craps) or the
bank (bank craps) on the outcome of one roll, or of a series of rolls of two
dice. Because it requires very little equipment, craps can easily be played in
less formal settings, and is said to be popular among soldiers. In such
situations side bets are more frequent, with one or several participants
covering or "fading" bets against the dice.

## [edit] The rules of play against a bank or casino

Bank craps is a game played by one or more players against a casino. The
casino covers all player bets at a table and sets the odds on its payout.
Players take turns rolling two dice. The player rolling the dice is called the
"shooter." Other players at the table will make bets on the shooter's dice
rolls. The game is played in rounds, with the first roll of a new round called
the "come-out roll". The second round resolves with a point being rolled or a
seven.

To begin, a player wishing to play as the shooter must bet at least the table
minimum on either the "Pass" line or the "Don't Pass" line (pass and donât
pass are sometimes called âWinâ or "Right" and âDonât Winâ or
"Wrong" bets for the outcome of a shooterâs round). The right to roll the
dice is rotated clockwise around the craps table. A player next in turn to
become shooter may refuse the dice, but can continue to bet on the shooter's
rolls; the dice then pass to the next player willing to become the shooter.
The shooter is then presented with multiple dice (typically five) by the
stickman, and must choose two to roll with. The remaining dice are returned to
the stickman's bowl and are not used.

At this point, the shooter makes a "come-out roll" with the intention of
establishing a point. If the shooter's come-out roll is a 2, 3 or 12, it is
called "craps" (the shooter is said to "crap out") and the round ends with
players losing their pass line bets (don't pass wins on 2 and 3, and pushes on
12). A come-out roll of 7 or 11 is called a "natural," resulting in a win for
pass line bets (and a loss for don't pass bets). Either way, the come-out roll
continues for the same shooter until a point is established. If the numbers 4,
5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 are rolled on the come-out, this number becomes the "point"
and the come out roll is now over. The dealers will move an "On" button to the
point number which identifies the point number to all players at the table.
The shooter will now continue rolling until either the point is rolled or a
seven. If the shooter is successful in rolling the point, the result is a win
for the pass line (and a loss for the don't pass). If the shooter rolls a
seven (called a "seven-out"), the pass line loses (and the don't pass wins). A
seven-out ends the round with the dice being passed (clockwise) to the next
player who wishes to become the new shooter.

A player wishing to play craps without being the shooter should approach the
craps table and first check to see if the dealer's "On" button is on any of
the point numbers. If the point number is "Off" then the table is in the come-
out round. If the dealer's button is on, the table is in the point round where
some casinos may allow a pass/don't pass bet to be placed, but the player
should check with the dealer. All single or multi roll proposition bets may be
placed in either of the two rounds. Between dice rolls by the shooter, there
is a period for dealers to make pay outs and collect losing bets. When the
dealers are finished, players are then allowed to place new bets. The stickman
monitors the action at a table and decides when to give the shooter the dice,
after which no more betting is allowed.

In a casino, players will make bets with chips on a specially made craps table
with a table cloth made of felt that displays the various betting
possibilities. In most casinos, craps table are double sided. The layouts on
both sides of the table are identical, with the center bets in the middle.
This allows for more players to participate. Players can make a large number
of bets for each turn, round, or roll and should become familiar with the
craps layout.

A casino craps table is run by four casino employees: a boxman who guards the
chips, supervises the dealers and handles coloring out players (exchanging
small chip denominations for larger denominations in order to preserve the
chips at a table); two base dealers who stand to either side of the boxman and
collect and pay bets; and a stickman who stands directly across the table from
the boxman, takes bets in the center of the table (hard ways, yo, craps, horn
etc), announces the results of each roll, collects the dice with an elongated
wooden stick, and directs the base dealers to pay winners from bets in the
center of the table. Each employee makes sure the other is paying out winners
correctly. Occasionally, during off-peak times, only one base dealer will be
attending the table, rendering only half the table open for bettors or one of
the two base dealers will assume the role of the stickman.

The dealers will insist that the shooter roll with one hand and that the dice
bounce off the far wall surrounding the table. These requirements are meant to
keep the game fair (preventing switching the dice or making a "controlled
shot"). If a die leaves the table, the shooter will usually be asked to select
another die from the remaining three but can request using the same die if it
passes the boxman's inspection. This requirement is used to keep the game fair
(and reduce the chance of loaded dice).

Names of Rolls in Craps 1 2 3 4 5 6

Nicknaming the rolls comes with making the game more interesting. Locals often
have their own names. Nine is often called a "Centerfield Nine" because 9 is
the center of the Field bet. Five is often called "No Field Five" to remind
the players that 5 is not paid in the Field bets. Some dealers and players
refer to any nine (5-4 or 6-3) as a "Lou Brown." The 4 (usually hard) is
sometimes referred to as "Little Joe, from Kokomo." In Atlantic City, a 4-5 is
called a "Railroad Nine." Eleven is called out as "Yo" or "Yo'Leven" because
it can often be mistaken for a seven. Rolls of 4, 6, 8, and 10 are called
"hard" or "easy" (e.g. "Six the Hard Way", "Easy Eight", "Hard Ten") depending
on whether they were rolled as a "double" or as any other combination of
values, because of their significance in center table bets known as the "hard
ways".

### [edit] Line bets

Standard layout for craps (without Big 6/8)

The shooter is required to make either a Pass Line bet or a Don't Pass bet if
he wants to shoot. Line bets are based around points.

Pass line bet: The fundamental bet in craps is the pass line bet, also called
the win line in some countries. A pass line bet is won immediately if the
come-out roll is a 7 or 11. If the come-out roll is 2, 3 or 12, the bet loses
(known as "crapping out"). If the roll is any other value, it establishes a
point; if that point is rolled again before a seven, the bet wins. If, with a
point established, a seven is rolled before the point is re-rolled, the bet
loses ("seven out").

Don't pass line bet: The don't pass line bet is almost the opposite of the
pass line bet. The don't pass bet is opposite in that it loses if the come-out
roll is 7 or 11 and wins if the come-out roll is 2 or 3. A 12 will draw (this
depends on the casinoâ in some places a 12 will win and a 2 will draw);
either way a player cannot lose if 12 is rolled. A draw (the word "BAR,"
printed on the Craps layout, means "Standoff") on 12 is done to ensure the
casino maintains a house edge regardless of whether players are betting pass
or don't pass. If a point is established and that point is rolled again, the
don't pass bet loses. If a 7 is rolled instead of the point being re-rolled,
the don't pass bet wins. There are two very slightly different ways to
calculate the odds and house edge of this bet.[3] The table below gives the
numbers considering that the game ends in a push when a 12 is rolled, rather
than being undetermined. Betting on don't pass is often called "playing the
dark side," and it is considered by some players to be in poor taste, or even
taboo, because it goes directly against conventional play.

Pass odds: If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is thrown on the come-out roll (i.e., if
a point is set), most casinos allow pass line bettors to take odds by placing
from one to five times (and at some casinos, up to 100 times) the pass line
bet behind the pass line. This additional bet wins if the point is rolled
again before a 7 is rolled (the point is made) and pays at the true odds of
2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point, 3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, and 6-to-5 if 6
or 8 is the point.

Some casinos offer "3-4-5X Odds," where the maximum allowed odds bet depends
on the point (three times if the point is 4 or 10, four times on 5 or 9, and
five times on 6 or 8). This rule simplifies the calculation of winnings: a
maximum pass odds bet on a 3-4-5X table will always be paid at six times the
pass line bet regardless of the point.

As odds bets are paid at true odds, in contrast with the pass line which is
always even money, playing pass odds on a minimum pass line bet lessens the
house advantage. A maximum odds bet on a minimum pass line bet gives the
lowest house edge available in the casino.

Don't pass odds: If a player is playing don't pass instead of pass, they may
also lay odds by placing chips behind the don't pass line. If a 7 comes
instead of the point coming, the odds pay at true odds of 1-to-2 if 4 or 10 is
the point, 2-to-3 if 5 or 9 is the point, 5-to-6 if 6 or 8 is the point.

Come bet: A come bet is played in two rounds and is played similar to a pass
line bet. If a 7 or 11 is rolled on the first round, it wins. If a 2, 3 or 12
is rolled, it loses. If instead the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 then the come
bet will be moved by the base dealer onto a box representing the number the
shooter threw. This number becomes the come bet point and the player is
allowed to add odds to the bet. The dealer will place the odds on top of the
come bet, but slightly off center in order to differentiate between the
original bet and the odds. The second round wins if the shooter rolls the come
bet before a seven. If the seven comes before the number (the come-bet), the
bet loses. On a come-out roll for the pass line the come bet is in play, but
traditionally the odds are not working unless the player indicates otherwise
to the dealer.

Come wagers can only be made after after a point has been established--on a
come out roll the come bet is placed on the pass line as they are an identical
bet.

Because of the come bet, if the shooter makes their point, a player can find
themselves in the situation where they have a come bet (possibly with odds on
it) and the next roll is a come-out roll. In this situation odds bets on the
come wagers are presumed to be not working for the come-out roll. That means
that if the shooter rolls a 7 on the come-out roll, any players with active
come bets waiting for a come-point lose their initial wager but will have
their odds money returned to them. If the come-point is rolled the odds do not
win but the come bet does and the odds are returned. The player can tell the
dealer that they want their odds working, such that if the shooter rolls a
number that matches the come point, the odds bet will win along with the come
bet, and if a seven is rolled both lose.

Don't come bet: A don't come bet is played in two rounds. If a 2 or 3 is
rolled in the first round, it wins. If a 7 or 11 is rolled, it loses. If a 12
is rolled, it is a standoff and the player has the option to revoke their bet.
If instead the roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 then the don't come bet will be moved
by the base dealer onto a box representing the number the shooter threw. The
second round wins if the shooter rolls a seven before the don't come point.

Don't come wagers can only be made after the come-out roll when a point has
already been established. Odds can also be placed on a don't come-bet just
like a pass line bet; in this case the dealer (not the player) places the odds
bet on top of the bet in the box, because of limited space, slightly offset to
signify that it is an odds bet and not part of the original don't come bet.

### [edit] Single roll bets

Single-roll bets or proposition bets are resolved in one dice roll by the
shooter. Only the stickman can place these bets for players, and they are
located at the center of most craps tables. The bets include:

2 (snake eyes, or Aces): Wins if shooter rolls a 2.

3 (ace-deuce): Wins if the shooter rolls a 3.

Yo: Wins if the shooter rolls 11.

12 (boxcars, or midnight): Wins if shooter rolls a 12.

2 or 12 (hi-lo): Wins if shooter rolls a 2 or 12. The stickman places this bet
on the line dividing the 2 and 12 bets.

Any Craps: Wins if the shooter rolls 2, 3 or 12.

C & E: A combined bet, a player is betting half their bet on craps and the
other half on yo (11). One of the two bets will always lose, the other may
win.

Any seven: Wins if the shooter rolls a 7. This bet is also nicknamed Big Red,
since the 7 on its betting space on the layout is usually large and red.

Field: This bet is a wager that one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12
will appear on the next roll of the dice. This bet typically pays more 2:1 or
3:1 if 2 or 12 is rolled, and 1:1 if 3, 4, 9, 10 or 11 is rolled. Unlike the
other proposition bets which are handled by the dealers or stickman, the field
bet is placed directly by the player.

The Horn: This is a bet that involves betting on 1 unit each for 2, 3, 11 and
12 at the same time for the next roll. The bet is actually four separate bets,
and pays off depending on which number is actually rolled, minus three units
for the other three losing bets. Many players, in order to eliminate the
confusion of tossing four chips to the center of the table or having change
made while bets are being placed, will make a five-unit Horn High bet, which
is a four-way bet with the extra unit going to one specific number. For
example, if you toss a $5 chip into the center and say "horn high yo," you are
placing four $1 bets on each of the horn numbers and the extra dollar will go
on the yo (11).

Whirl or World: bet is a five-unit bet that is a combination of a horn and
any-seven bet, with the idea that if a seven is rolled the bet is a push,
because the money won on the seven is lost on the horn portions of the bet.

On the Hop This is a single roll bet on any particular combination of the two
dice on the next roll. For example, if you bet on "5 and 1" on the hop, you
are betting that the next roll will have a 5 on one die and a 1 on the other
die. The bet pays 15:1 (just like a bet on 3 or 11) except for doubles (i.e. 3
and 3 on the hop) which pay 30:1 (just like a bet on 12, which is the same as
6 and 6 on the hop). The true odds are 17:1 and 35:1, resulting in a house
edge of 11.11% and 13.89% respectively. When presented, hop bets are located
at the center of the craps layout with the other proposition bets. If hop bets
are not on the craps layout, they still may be bet on by players.

### [edit] Multi roll bets

These are bets that may not be settled on the first roll and may need any
number of subsequent rolls before an outcome is determined. Most multi-roll
bets may fall into the situation where a point is made by the shooter before
the outcome of the multi roll bet is decided. These bets are considered "not
working" in the new come-out roll until the next point is established, unless
the player calls the bet as "working." Casino rules vary on this; some of
these bets may not be callable, while others may be considered "working"
during the come-out. If a non-working point number placed, bought or laid
becomes the new point as the result of a come-out, the bet is usually
refunded, or can be moved to another number for free.

Hard way: A bet that the shooter will throw a 4, 6, 8 or 10 the "hard way",
before he throws a seven or the corresponding "easy way". A hard way is when
both dice show identical values, also known as "doubles," so 2-2 is hard way
4.

Easy way: Opposite of hard way is a bet that the shooter will throw a specific
easy way (either 4, 6, 8 or 10), before he throws a seven. An easy way is a
value that does not have two dice identical, so 3 1 is easy way 4. These are
rarely available as bets except by placing on a point number (which pays off
on easy or hard rolls of that number).

Big 6 and Big 8: A player can choose either the 6 or 8 being rolled before the
shooter throws a seven. These wagers are usually avoided by experienced craps
players since they pay even money (1:1) while a player can make place bets on
the 6 or the 8, which pay more (7:6). Some casinos do not even offer the Big 6
& 8\. The bets are located in the corners behind the pass line, and bets may
be placed directly by players.

Place and buy: Players can buy or place any point number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10)
by placing their wager in the come area and telling the dealer, "place the 6"
or "buy the 8". Both place and buy bets are bets that the number bet on will
be rolled before a 7 is rolled. These bets are considered working bets, and
will continue to be paid out each time a shooter rolls the place or buy point
number.

Place bets are paid at odds slightly worse than the true odds, while buy bets
are paid at true odds, but a 5% commission is charged. Traditionally, the buy
bet commission is paid no matter what, but in recent years a number of casinos
have changed their policy to charge the commission only when the buy bet wins.
Some casinos charge the commission as a one-time fee to buy the number;
payouts are then always at true odds. Most casinos usually charge only $1 for
a $25 green-chip bet (4% commission), or $2 for $50 (two green chips),
reducing the house advantage a bit more. Where commission is charged only on
wins, the commission is often deducted from the winning payoff--a winning $25
buy bet on the 10 would pay $49, for instance. The house edges stated in the
table assume the commission is charged on all bets. They are reduced by at
least a factor of two if commission is charged on winning bets only.

Lay: A lay bet is the opposite of a buy/place bet, where a player bets on a 7
to roll before the number that is laid. The lay bets pay true odds, but a 5%
commission is charged. In some casinos the commission is only charged if the
bet wins. Like the buy bet the commission is adjusted to suit the betting unit
such that fraction of a dollar payouts are not needed.

### [edit] Player bets

Fire Bet: Before the shooter begins, some casinos will allow a bet known as a
fire bet to be placed. A fire bet is a bet of between 1-5 dollars (the Rio in
Las Vegas allows up to $10) in the hopes that the next shooter will have a hot
streak of setting and getting many points of different values. As different
individual points are made by the shooter, they will be marked on the craps
layout with a fire symbol. The first three points will not pay out on the fire
bet, but the fourth, fifth and sixth will pay out at increasing odds. The
fourth point pays at 25-1 (a maximum of $125 for a $5 bet), the fifth point
pays at 250-1 (a maximum of $1,250 for a $5 bet) and the 6th point pays at
1,000-1 (a maximum of $5,000 for a $5 bet). Note that the points must all be
different numbers for them to count towards the fire bet. For example, a
shooter who successfully hits a point of 10 twice will only garner credit for
the first one on the fire bet.

## [edit] Bet odds

    Note: Individual casinos may pay some of these bets at different "Odds Paid" ratios than those listed below. The payoff odds listed are the most common throughout North American casinos.
    Note: "Actual Odds" do not vary.

The probability of dice combinations determine the odds of the payout. The
following chart shows the dice combinations needed to roll each number. The
two and twelve are the hardest to roll since only one combination of dice is
possible. The game of craps is built around the dice roll of seven, since it
is the most easily rolled dice combination.

Dice Roll Possible Dice Combinations  
2 1-1  
3 1-2, 2-1  
4 1-3, 2-2, 3-1  
5 1-4, 2-3, 3-2, 4-1  
6 1-5, 2-4, 3-3, 4-2, 5-1  
7 1-6, 2-5, 3-4, 4-3, 5-2, 6-1  
8 2-6, 3-5, 4-4, 5-3, 6-2  
9 3-6, 4-5, 5-4, 6-3  
10 4-6, 5-5, 6-4  
11 5-6, 6-5  
12 6-6  
The expected value of all bets is negative, such that the average player will
always lose money. This is because the house always sets the paid odds to
below the actual odds. The only exception is the "odds" bet that the player is
allowed to make after a point is established on a pass/come don't pass/don't
come bet (the odds portion of the bet has a long-term expected value of 0).
However, the "free odds" bet cannot be made independently, so the expected
value of the entire bet, including odds, is still negative. Since there is no
correlation between die rolls, there is no possible long-term winning strategy
in craps.

Maximizing the size of the odds bet in relation to the line bet will reduce,
but never eliminate the house edge, and will increase variance. Many casinos
have a limit on how large the odds bet can be in relation to the flat bet,
with single, double, and five times odds common. Some casinos offer 3-4-5
odds, referring to the maximum multiple of the line bet a player can place in
odds for the points of 4 and 10, 5 and 9, and 6 and 8, respectively. During
promotional periods, a casino may even offer 100x odds bets, which reduces the
house edge to almost nothing, but dramatically increases variance, as the
player will be betting in large betting units.

Since several of the multiple roll bets pay off in ratios of fractions on the
dollar, it is important that the player bets in multiples that will allow a
correct payoff in complete dollars. Normally, payoffs will be rounded down to
the nearest dollar, resulting in a higher house advantage. These bets include
all place bets, taking odds, and buying on numbers 6, 8, 5, and 9, as well as
laying all numbers.

## [edit] Betting Variants

These variants depend on the casino and the table, and sometimes a casino will
have different tables that use or omit these variants and others.

  * 11 is a point number instead of a natural. Rolling an 11 still pays "Yo" center-table bets, however the Pass line does not automatically win (and the Don't Pass line doesn't automatically lose) when 11 is rolled on the come-out. Making the point pays 3:1 on Pass/Come odds bets (1:3 on Don't Pass/Come odds); all line bets are still even money. This slightly reduces the odds of a natural and of making the point in general, increasing the house edge on the pass line.

  * 12 pays 3:1 on the field. This is generally seen in rooms that have two different table minimums, on the tables with the higher minimums. The lower minimum ones will then have 2:1 odds.

  * 11 pays 2:1 on the field. This variant is normally used when 12 pays 3:1, and further lowers the house edge on the field.

  * Big 6/8 are unavailable. These bets are equivalent to placing or buying 6 or 8 as points, which have better payout for the same real odds, so Big 6/8 are rarely used and many casinos simply omit them from the layout.

## [edit] Optimal betting

Since all bets have a house advantage, and a negative expected value, the
optimal strategy is to be the house. Failing that, one can reduce one's
average losses by only placing bets with the smallest house advantage.

The pass/don't line, come/don't line, place 6, place 8, buy 4 and buy 10 (only
under the casino rules where commission is charged only on wins) are the best
bets with the lowest house edge in the casino, and all other bets will on
average lose money between three and twelve times faster because of the
difference in house edges.

The place bets and buy bets differ from the pass/don't line and come/don't
line, in that place bets and buy bets can be removed at any time, since they
are one-time propositions, whereas pass/don't line bets and come/don't line
bets must be resolved as "win or lose" once placed.

Among these, and the remaining numbers and possible bets, there are a myriad
of systems and progressions that can be used with many combinations of
numbers.

An important alternative metric is house advantage per roll (rather than per
bet), which may be expressed in loss per hour [4]. The typical pace of rolls
varies depending on the number of players, but 102 rolls per hour is a cited
rate for a nearly full table [5]. This same reference states that only "29.6%
of total rolls are come out rolls, on average," so for this alternative
metric, needing extra rolls to resolve the pass line bet, for example, is
factored. This number then permits calculation of rate of loss per hour, and
per the 4 day/5 hour per day gambling trip:

$10 Pass line bets 0.42% per roll, $4.28 per hour, $86 per trip

$10 Place 6,8 bets 0.46% per roll, $4.69 per hour, $94 per trip

$10 Place 5,9 bets 1.11% per roll, $11.32 per hour, $226 per trip

$10 Place 4,10 bets 1.19% per roll, $12.14 per hour, $243 per trip

$1 Single Hardways 2.78% per roll, $2.84 per hour, $56.71 per trip

$1 All hardways 2.78% per roll, $11.34 per hour, $227 per trip

$5 All hardways 2.78% per roll, $56.71 per hour, $1134 per trip

$1 Craps only on come out 3.29% per roll, $3.35 per hour, $67.09 per trip

$1 Eleven only on come out 3.29% per roll, $3.35 per hour, $67.09 per trip

More important than any particular system is simply to follow the same
principles as with most casino games:

  * play within one's means (i.e. within one's budget, a.k.a. bankroll)
  * pick a specific system per shooter or per session, and stay with that system
  * set limits on how much one will lose in a session (dollar amount or number of successive losses)
  * set win goals for the session, i.e. resist the urge to pour all profits into the next bet to increase winnings (or worse, to use a Martingale system to attempt to recover losses)
  * above all do not bet on the assumption that a number is either due to come up or due to stop coming up (see gambler's fallacy) 

## [edit] Etiquette

Besides the rules of the actual game, certain unwritten rules of etiquette
exist while playing craps and are expected to be followed. Many consider these
guidelines as important as the actual rules themselves. New players should
familiarize themselves with them before approaching a craps table.

### [edit] Rules related to casino security

Players are not supposed to handle the dice with more than one hand (such as
passing them from hand to hand before rolling) nor take the dice past the edge
of the table. The only way to change hands when throwing dice, if permitted at
all, is to set the dice on the table, let go, then take them with the other
hand. This reduces or eliminates the possibility of the shooter switching dice
by sleight-of-hand.

When throwing the dice, the player is expected to hit the farthest wall at the
opposite end of the table. Some casinos refer to throws that do not hit the
opposite wall as "Mellenberg Rolls."[citation needed] Most casinos will allow
a roll that does not hit the opposite wall as long as the dice are thrown past
the middle of the table, occasionally a short roll will be called a "no roll"
due to the more controllable nature of such a roll. The dice may not be slid
across the table and must be tossed. Typically, players are asked not to throw
the dice higher than the eye level of the dealers.

The dice cannot land in the boxman's bank, the stickman's bowl (where the
extra three dice are kept between rolls), or in rail around the top of the
table where players chips are kept. Dice can land on players bets on the
table, the dealer's working stacks, on the marker puck or with one die resting
on top of the other. If a die or both dice leave the table, it is also a "no
roll" and the boxperson will examine the dice before letting it come back into
the game. However, the player may request the same die or dice.

When either of the dice land on or come to rest leaning against chips,
markers, or the side of the table, the number that would be on top if the
object the die is leaning on were removed, is the number that is used to make
the call.

If one or both dice hits a player or dealer and rolls back onto the table, the
roll counts as long as the person being hit did not interfere with either of
the dice, though some casinos will rule "no roll" for this situation.

In most cases the shooter may "set" the dice to a particular configuration,
but if they do, they are often asked to be quick about it so as not to delay
the game. Some casinos have "no setting" rules.

Dealers are not allowed to touch the players or hand chips directly to a
player, and vice versa. If "buying in" (paying cash for chips) at the table,
players are expected to lay the cash down on the layout, which the dealer will
take and then place chips in front of the player.

Many craps table layouts state "NO CALL BETS". This means a player is not
allowed to call out a bet without having at least the right amount of chips on
the table. If the chips exceed the bet, for example a $100 chip is placed and
bets called out of "$25 on five and nine", the dealer will say "it's a bet"
and return $50 change to the player. The dealer doesn't have to actually place
the bet in the proper place on the table to constitute a valid bet. This
method is consistent with the fast action of the game, allowing a player to
make a last-second bet while the dice are about to be thrown. The NO CALL BET
rule may exist to prevent confusion on the amount bet, possibly going back to
the days of 25 cent tables. For example "three fifty" could mean $3.50 or
$350. If the dealer is not clear about the intention of the player he may
state "no bet" and push the chips back to the player.

Like any other table game, the casino can ask a player to leave the table or
the casino for any reason.

### [edit] Commonly observed etiquette

It is generally preferable to place chips on the board rather than tossing
them. Tossed chips may roll on edge out of the dealer's reach and/or upset
other stacks of chips.[6] A center bet controlled by the stickman (usually the
hardest person to reach) can be made by passing chips to the nearest dealer,
who will relay the bet to the stickman. When chips must be tossed it is polite
to gain the dealer or stickman's attention and toss as few chips as necessary
to cover the bet (a $25 chip is preferable to a stack of five $5 chips).

When offered the dice to shoot, a player may pass the dice to the next player
without fear of offending anyone; however, at least one player must always be
a "shooter" betting on either the pass line or don't pass line for the game to
continue.[7]

When tipping, the most common way is simply to toss chips onto the table and
say, "For the dealers" or "For the boys" (the latter is considered acceptable
even though dealers often are women). It's also common to place a bet for the
dealers. If the bet is one handled by the dealers, such as a Place bet or one
of the proposition bets handled by the stick-man, the chip(s) should be
placed, or thrown, and announced as a dealer bet, such as "Dealer's hard
eight", or "Place the eight for the dealers". A "two-way" bet is one that is
part for the player and part for the dealers. Usually, the dealers' bet is
smaller than the player's bet, but it is appreciated. The part of the bet for
the dealer is called a "toke" bet; this is from the $1 slot machine coins or
tokens that are sometimes used to place bets for the dealers in a casino. Most
casinos require the dealers to pick up their winning bets, including the
original tip, rather than "let it ride" as the player may choose to do. If the
player wants the original dealer bet to remain in place, the phrase "I control
the bet" should be clearly stated by the tipper, and acknowledged by the one
of the crew, immediately upon announcing the dealer bet. This indicates that
any winnings for that bet will be picked up by the dealers, and the original
amount will remain in play until a losing decision.

The $1 "yo" (eleven) bet, split with the dealers on come-out rolls by calling
out "two-way yo," tends to be a favorite with many players as means of tipping
the dealers without giving up too much per gambling trip. If eleven comes out
on the come out roll, the pass line win bets and the more substantial "yo" bet
splits (see see reference).

  
After the come-out roll, it is considered bad luck to say the word "seven". A
common "nickname" for this number is "Big Red", or just "Red".

It is considered bad luck to change dice in the middle of a roll. If one or
both dice leave the table, and the shooter does not want a new die (or dice)
substituted into the game, the shooter should immediately and loudly call
"Same Dice!". The retrieved die (or dice) will then be returned to play after
close inspection by the boxman. Most casinos will immediately begin the
process of introducing new dice unless the shooter has requested otherwise,
though some casinos will inspect the dice by default.

Proposition bets, the bets in the center of the table, are made by tossing
chips to the center of the table and calling out the intended bet; the
stickman will then place the chips correctly for the player. As mentioned
above, care should be taken when tossing chips. Players furthest from the
stickman can often elect to place a center bet with a dealer who will relay
the bet to the center.

It is considered rude to "late bet," or make wagers while the dice are no
longer in the middle of the table. While entirely permissible, excessive late
betting will generally garner a warning. At their discretion or that of a "pit
boss", dealers can disallow a bet made after the dice have left the center.

Food, drinks, cigarettes, and other items should remain off the chip rail and
should not be held over the table.

Players feel it is bad luck for the shooter to leave the table after a
successful come-out roll. A shooter retains the right to roll and is expected
to continue rolling until he or she sevens out. If the shooter leaves the game
before a decision is reached on a point number, the dice will be passed to the
next player to continue where the shooter left off. Once a decision is
reached, the "substitute" shooter can, at the discretion of the boxman,
continue to roll the dice for a new "come out" as would have been the case had
the previous shooter completed their roll.

When the shooter is ready to roll, players should remove their hands from the
table area in order to avoid interfering with the dice. The stickman will
often say "hands high, let 'em fly" or "dice are out, hands high".

When making bets in the field or on the Big 6 or Big 8, it is the player's
responsibility to track his or her bet. Place bets and Come Line bets will be
tracked by the dealer, who will pay the player directly. Hardway and other
proposition bets are tracked by the stickman and will be paid by the dealer to
the player directly based on instructions from the stickman.

## [edit] Systems

### [edit] Martingale system

No wagering system can consistently beat casino games of pure chance such as
craps, but that does not stop hopeful gamblers believing in them. One of the
best known systems is the Martingale System, in which the player starts by
betting a given amount, for instance $1, and doubles his bet whenever he
loses. Upon winning, he starts over at the initial amount. The idea is to
realize a net win equal to the initial amount after every eventual win. This
system fails because the player will either run out of money after having to
double his bet several times in a row after a streak of losing bets, or he
will be unable to bet the amount dictated by the system because it would
exceed the maximum bet allowed by the casino. The Martingale system also only
yields a profit equal to the initial bet amount every time the player wins. If
the initial amount is small, the payout from each Martingale sequence will be
just as small.

  

### [edit] Gambler's fallacy

Other systems depend on the gambler's fallacy, which in craps terms is the
belief that past dice rolls influence the probabilities of future dice rolls.
For example, the gambler's fallacy indicates that a craps player should bet on
eleven if an eleven has not appeared or has appeared too often in the last 20
rolls.

In reality, each roll of the dice is an independent event, so the probability
of rolling an eleven is exactly 1/18 on every roll, even if eleven has not
come up in the last 100 rolls, or if eleven has come up five times in the last
five rolls. Even if the dice are actually biased toward particular results
("loaded"), each roll is still independent of all of the previous ones. The
common term to describe this is "dice have no memory".

### [edit] Parity hedge system

The parity hedge system is a hoax promulgated by Quatloos. Despite the fact
that no such system exists (indeed, it is a mathematical impossibility),
several gambling-related web sites have retold the 'parity hedge' story
without attribution.

### [edit] Dice setting or dice control

Main article: Dice control

Another approach is to "set" the dice in a particular orientation, and then
throw them in such a manner that they do not tumble randomly. The theory is
that the dice will be more likely to show certain numbers. Unlike other
systems, this one is mathematically plausible, because if it were possible to
alter the probabilities of each outcome, then winning systems could be
devised.

Casinos do take steps to prevent this. The dice are required to hit the back
wall of the table, which makes controlled spins more difficult. Whether it is
possible for human beings to consistently exercise the precise physical
control necessitated by the theory is a source of controversy. A small but
dedicated community of controlled shooters maintain records and claim proof of
dice influencing in casino conditions. Frank Scoblete, Stanford Wong and Jerry
L. Patterson, authors of books that feature dice control techniques, believe
that it is possible to alter the odds in the player's favor by dice control.

Chris Pawlicki, a mechanical engineer who (under the pseudonym "Sharpshooter")
wrote a book on dice setting called Get The Edge At Craps: How to Control the
Dice as a part of the Frank Scoblete "Get the Edge Guides," defined the math
and science behind dice control.[8]

In addition, some people offer to teach dice-setting skills for a substantial
fee. Currently there has been no independent conclusive evidence that such
methods can be successfully applied in a real casino.

## [edit] The rules of play against other players

Recreational or informal playing of craps outside of a casino is referred to
as street craps or private craps. The most notable difference between playing
street craps and bank craps is that there is no bank or house to cover bets in
street craps. Players must bet against each other by covering or fading each
others bets for the game to be played.[9] If money is used instead of chips
and depending on the laws of where it is being played, street craps can be an
illegal form of gambling.[10]

There are many variations of street craps. The simplest way is to either agree
on or roll a number as the point, then roll the point again before you roll a
seven. Unlike more complex proposition bets offered by casinos, street craps
has more simplified betting options. The shooter is required to make either a
Pass or a Don't Pass bet if he wants to roll the dice. Another player must
choose to cover the shooter to create a stake for the game to continue. If
there are several players, the rotation of the player who must cover the
shooter may change with the shooter (comparable to a blind in poker). The
person covering the shooter will always bet against the shooter. For example,
if the shooter made a "Pass" bet, the person covering the shooter would make a
"Don't Pass" bet to win. Once the shooter is covered, other players may make
Pass/Don't Pass bets, or any other proposition bets, as long as there is
another player willing to cover.
