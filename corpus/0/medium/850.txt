The Bohm or Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics, which Bohm called the
causal, or later, the ontological interpretation, is an interpretation
postulated by David Bohm in 1952 as an alternative to the standard Copenhagen
interpretation. The Bohm interpretation grew out of the search for an
alternative model based on the assumption of hidden variables. Its basic
formalism corresponds in the main to Louis de Broglie's pilot-wave theory of
1927. Consequently it is sometimes called the de Broglie-Bohm theory. The
interpretation was developed further during the sixties and seventies under
the heading of the causal interpretation in order to distinguish it from the
purely probabilistic approach of the standard interpretation. Bohm later
extended the approach to include both a deterministic and a stochastic
version. The fullest presentation is given in Bohm and Hiley The Undivided
Universe, presented under the heading of an ontological interpretation to
emphasize its concern with âbeablesâ rather than with âobservables,â
and in contradistinction to the predominantly epistemological approach of the
standard model. In its final form, building on the insights of Bell and
others, the ontological interpretation is causal but non-local, and non-
relativistic, while capable of being extended beyond the domain of the current
quantum theory in a number of ways.

In the Bohm interpretation, every particle has a definite position and
momentum at all times, but we do not usually know what they are, though we do
have limited information about them. The particles are guided by the wave
function, which follows the SchrÃ¶dinger equation.

The Bohm interpretation is an example of a hidden variables theory. Bohm
originally hoped that hidden variables could provide a local, causal,
objective description that would resolve or eliminate many of the paradoxes of
quantum mechanics, such as SchrÃ¶dinger's cat, the measurement problem and the
collapse of the wavefunction. However, Bell's theorem complicates this hope,
as it demonstrates that there is no locally causal hidden variable theory that
is compatible with quantum mechanics. The Bohmian interpretation is causal but
not local.

The Bohm interpretation is non-relativistic.

The Bohm interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics. In other
words, it has not been disproven, but there are other schemes (such as the
Copenhagen interpretation) that give the same theoretical predictions, so are
equally confirmed by the experimental results.

## [edit] The theory

### [edit] Principles

The Bohm interpretation is based on these principles:

  * Every particle travels in a definite path

    Each particle is viewed as having a definite position and velocity at all times.
  * We do not know what that path is

    Measurements allow us to successively retroactively refine the bounds on the particle path at some time, but there always remains some classical uncertainty in the position and momentum (as there always is in any classical theory), which increases with time.
  * Every particle is accompanied by a field, which guides the motion of the particle

    De Broglie called this the pilot wave; Bohm called it the Ï-field. This field has a piloting influence on the motion of the particles. The quantum potential is derived from the Ï-field.
  * This field satisfies the SchrÃ¶dinger equation

    Mathematically, the field corresponds to the wavefunction of conventional quantum mechanics, and evolves according to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. The positions of the particles do not affect the wave function.
  * The particle's momentum p is \\nabla S\(x,t\)

    The particles momentum can be calculated from the value of the wavefunction at the position of the particle. See the section on One-particle formalism for a discussion of the mathematics.
  * The particles form a statistical ensemble, with probability density \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)  = |\\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\)|^2

    Although we don't know the position of any individual particle before we measure them, we find after the measurement that the statistics conform to the probability density function that is based on the wavefunction in the usual way.
In its basic form, the Bohm interpretation is non-relativistic; it does not
attempt to deal with high speeds or significant gravity. There are extensions
that address relativistic issues.

The Bohm interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics; it was
originally developed as an objective and deterministic alternative to the
Copenhagen interpretation. It says that the state of the universe evolves
smoothly through time, with no collapsing of wavefunctions.

The Bohm interpretation is a hidden variables theory. In other words, there is
a precisely defined history of the universe; however, some of the variables
that define the history are not (and cannot be) known to the observer. For
that reason, there is uncertainty in what we know about the universe.

### [edit] Name and evolution

The Bohm Interpretation is not a single closed theory, but is open-ended and
has evolved through stages. Occasionally, to understand a paper, it is
necessary to identify the stage that it refers to.

In this section, each stage is given a name and a main reference. To get an
understanding of which stage a paper refers to, the name is a quick (but
unreliable) clue; comparing the references gives a better understanding.

Pilot-wave theory

This was the theory which de Broglie presented at the 1927 Solvay
Conference[1].

This stage applies to many spin-less particles, and is deterministic, but
lacks an adequate theory of measurement.

De Broglie-Bohm Theory or Bohmian Mechanics

This was described by Bohm's original papers 'A Suggested Interpretation of
the Quantum Theory in Terms of "Hidden Variables" I and II' [Bohm 1952]. It
extended the original Pilot Wave Theory to incorporate a consistent theory of
measurement, and to address a criticism of Pauli that de Broglie did not
properly respond to[clarification needed]; it is taken to be deterministic
(though Bohm hinted in the original papers that there should be disturbances
to this, in the way Brownian motion disturbs Newtonian mechanics). This stage
is known as the de Broglie-Bohm Theory in Bell's work [Bell 1987] and is the
basis for 'The Quantum Theory of Motion' [Holland 1993]. It is also referred
to in some papers as Bohmian Mechanics.

This stage applies to multiple particles, and is considered by most authors to
be deterministic.

Causal Interpretation and Ontological Interpretation

Bohm developed his original ideas, calling them the Causal Interpretation.
Later he felt that causal sounded too much like deterministic and preferred to
call his theory the Ontological Interpretation. The main reference is 'The
Undivided Universe' [Bohm, Hiley 1993].

These stages cover work by Bohm and in collaboration with Vigier and Hiley.
Bohm is clear that this theory is non-deterministic (the work with Hiley
includes a stochastic theory).

    As an example, take the paper "A first experimental test of de Broglie-Bohm theory against standard quantum mechanics" [2] This refers to "On the Incompatibility of Standard Quantum Mechanics and the de Broglie-Bohm Theory"[2]. These papers base their argument on determinism, and refer to [Holland 1993] as the reference. One can see that they refer to the deterministic de Broglie-Bohm theory but not to Bohm's Causal interpretation.
### [edit] Results

The Bohm interpretation demonstrates that some features of the Copenhagen
interpretation are not essential to Quantum mechanics, but are a feature of
the interpretation. Some specific features are:

  * wave collapse
  * entanglement
  * the non-existence of particles while not being observed

Examination of the Bohm interpretation has shown that nonlocality is a general
feature of Quantum mechanics interpretations, including the Copenhagen
interpretation where it was not originally obvious.

### [edit] Reformulating the SchrÃ¶dinger equation

Some of Bohm's insights are based on a reformulation of the SchrÃ¶dinger
equation; instead of using the wavefunction \\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\), he solves
it for the magnitude R\(\\mathbf{x},t\) and complex phase S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)
of the wavefunction. This section presents the mathematics; the next section
presents the insights.

The SchrÃ¶dinger equation for one particle of mass m is

    i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\nabla^2 \\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\)+ V\(\\mathbf{x}\) \\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\),
where the wavefunction \\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\) is a complex function of the
spatial coordinate \\mathbf{x} and time t.

The probability density \\rho \(\\mathbf{x},t\) is a real function defined as
the magnitude of the wave function:

    \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)  = |\\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\)|^2.
We can express the wavefunction \\psi\(\\mathbf{x}, t\) in polar coordinates;
Without loss of generality, we can define real functions R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)
and S\(\\mathbf{x},t\) such that:

    \\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\) = R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)e^{i S\(\\mathbf{x},t\) / \\hbar}.
The SchrÃ¶dinger equation can then be split into two coupled equations by
expressing it in terms of R and S:

    \\frac{\\partial R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{-1}{2m}\[R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)\\nabla ^2S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)+2\\nabla R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)\\cdot \\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)\] 
    \\frac{\\partial S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = -\\left\[ V + \\frac{1}{2m}\(\\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)\)^2 -\\frac{\\hbar ^2}{2m} \\frac{\\nabla ^2R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)} \\right\] 
The magnitude R\(\\mathbf{x},t\) is |\\psi \(\\mathbf{x},t\)|, so that
R^2\(\\mathbf{x},t\) corresponds to the probability density \\rho
\(\\mathbf{x},t\) = |\\psi \(\\mathbf{x},t\)|^2.

S\(\\mathbf{x},t\) is the complex phase chosen to have the units and typical
variable name of an action. Thus

    \\psi\(\\mathbf{x},t\) = \\sqrt{\\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)} e^{i S\(\\mathbf{x},t\) / \\hbar}.
Therefore we can substitute \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\) for R^2\(\\mathbf{x},t\)
and get:

    -\\frac{\\partial \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left\(\\rho \(\\mathbf{x},t\)\\frac{\\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{m}\\right\) \\qquad \(1\) 
    -\\frac{\\partial S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = V\(\\mathbf{x}\) + Q\(\\mathbf{x},t\) + \\frac{1}{2m}\(\\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)\)^2  \\qquad \(2\) 
where

    Q\(\\mathbf{x},t\) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{\\nabla^2 R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{R\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}
= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\frac{\\nabla^2 \\sqrt{\\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}}{
\\sqrt{\\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}}

= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\left\(\\frac{\\nabla^2 \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{2
\\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}

-\\left\(\\frac{\\nabla \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{2 \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}
\\right\)^2

 \\right\)

Bohm called the function Q\(\\mathbf{x},t\) the quantum potential.

We can use the same argument on the many-particle SchrÃ¶dinger equation:

    i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi\(\\mathbf{x_1,x_2,...},t\)}{\\partial t} = \\sum_i \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2 m_i} \\nabla_i^2 \\psi\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) + V\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..}\)\\psi\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,...},t\) ,
where the i-th particle has mass m_i\\, and position coordinate \\mathbf{x_i}
at time t. The wavefunction \\psi\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,...},t\) is a complex
function of all the \\mathbf{x_i} and time t. \\nabla_i is the grad operator
with respect to \\mathbf{x_i}, i.e. of the i-th particle's position
coordinate. As before the probability density \\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1,
x_2,...},t\) is a real function defined by

    \\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) = |\\psi\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)|^2 .
As before, we can define a real function S\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,...},t\) to be
the complex phase,so that we can define a similar relationship to the
1-particle example:

    \\psi\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) = \\sqrt{\\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)} e^{i S\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) / \\hbar}.
We can use the same argument to express the SchrÃ¶dinger equation in terms of
\\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) and S\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\):

    -\\frac{\\partial \\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}{\\partial t} = \\sum_i \\nabla_i \\cdot \(\\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) \\frac{\\nabla_i S\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}{m_i}\) \\qquad \(3\) 
    -\\frac{\\partial S\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}{\\partial t} = V\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..}\) + Q\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) + \\sum_i \\frac{1}{2m_i}\(\\nabla_i S\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)\)^2 \\qquad \(4\) 
where

    Q\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\) = -\\sum_i \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_i} \\frac{\\nabla_i^2 R\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}{R\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)} 
= -\\sum_i\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_i} \\left\(\\frac{\\nabla_i^2
\\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}{2 \\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}

-\\left\(\\frac{\\nabla_i \\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}{2 \\rho\(\\mathbf{x_1, x_2,..},t\)}
\\right\)^2

 \\right\)

.

### [edit] One-particle formalism

In his 1952 paper, Bohm starts from the reformulated SchrÃ¶dinger equation. He
points out that in equation (2):

    -\\frac{\\partial S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = V\(\\mathbf{x}\) + Q\(\\mathbf{x},t\) + \\frac{1}{2m}\(\\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)\)^2 ,
if one represents the world of classical physics by setting \\hbar to zero
(which results in Q becoming zero) then S\(\\mathbf{x},t\) is the solution to
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. He quotes a theorem that says that if an
ensemble of particles (which follow the equations of motion) have trajectories
that are normal to a surface of constant S, then they are normal to all
surfaces of constant S, and that \\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)/m is the velocity
of any particle passing point \\mathbf{x} at time t.

Therefore, we can express equation (1) as:

    -\\frac{\\partial \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left\(\\rho \(\\mathbf{x},t\)\\mathbf{v}\\right\) 
This equation shows that it is consistent to express \\rho \(\\mathbf{x},t\)
as the probability density because \\rho \(\\mathbf{x},t\)\\mathbf{v} is then
the mean current of particles, and the equation expresses the conservation of
probability.

Of course, \\hbar  is non-zero. Bohm suggests that we still treat the particle
velocity as \\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)/m. The movement of a particle is
described by equation (2):

    -\\frac{\\partial S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{\\partial t} = V\(\\mathbf{x}\) + Q\(\\mathbf{x},t\) + \\frac{1}{2m}\(\\nabla S\(\\mathbf{x},t\)\)^2  
where

    Q\(\\mathbf{x},t\) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\left\(\\frac{\\nabla^2 \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{2 \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}
-\\left\(\\frac{\\nabla \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}{2 \\rho\(\\mathbf{x},t\)}
\\right\)^2

 \\right\)

V is the classical potential, which influences the particle's movement in the
ways described by the classical laws of motion.

Q also has the form of a potential; it is known as the quantum potential. It
influences particles in ways that are specific to quantum theory. Thus the
particle is moving under the influence of a quantum potential Q as well as the
classical potential V.

The quantum potential does not vary with the strength of the Ï-field; this is
evident because Ï and its derivatives appear both in the numerator and the
denominator of the quantum potential. Thus the quantum potential guides the
particles, even when the Ï-field is weak.

### [edit] Many-particle formalism

The momentum of Bohm's i-th particle's "hidden variable" is defined by

    \\mathbf{p_i} = {m_i} \\mathbf{v_i} = \\nabla_i S \\qquad \(3\)
and the particles' total energy as E = - \\partial S / \\partial t; equation
(1) is the continuity equation for probability with

    \\mathbf{j_i} = \\rho \\mathbf{v_i} = \\rho \\frac{\\mathbf{p_i}}{m_i} = \\rho \\frac{\\nabla_i S}{m_i},
and equation (4) is a statement that total energy is the sum of the potential
energy, quantum potential and the kinetic energies.

### [edit] Comparison with experimental data

An important prediction of the Bohm theory, made in Bohm's original 1952
paper, is that the electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is in rest
(cf. equation (3) above - s states have spherical symmetry and thus have
constant phase), as the quantum force introduced by Bohm balances the
classical electromagnetic potential.

Any measurement of the momentum of a ground state electron will give a non-
zero result as predicted by quantum mechanics, but Bohm's theory argues that
the act of measuring the momentum disturbs the electron at rest, resulting in
a non-zero expection value. [3]

Experimental observation of the decay rates of muons bound in exotic atoms has
shown, however, that ground state electrons are in fact in motion. Because of
their mass, muons captured in higher states rapidly cascade to the ground
state, and about 99 percent of the bound muons decay from the 1S state. If the
atomic number of the hydrogen-like atom is high enough, the muon motion will
be relativistic, and subject to time dilation. The data show that for moderate
Z atoms, the observed lengthening of the muon decay time can be attributed to
the relativistic time dilation.[4]

Since the motion of the muon has been demonstrated without any disturbance of
the atom, it cannot be explained by disturbances related to the measurement
process as with conventional measurements of the momentum of ground state
electrons. An important conceptual prediction of the Bohm model, namely that
ground state electrons are at rest, would seem to be contradicted by
experimental evidence. But Bohm's prediction of the lack of motion of the
lepton in the s state is only a non-relativistic prediction, since the
SchrÃ¶dinger equation is non-relativistic. Therefore the muon result, which
relies on time dilation, is not at variance with the accepted theoretical
demonstration that Bohm's theory reproduces all the non-relativistic results
of the other conventional quantum interpretations.

Further, it should be noted that since relativistic quantum theories (such as
quantum field theory) can always be expressed in terms of a local Lagrangian
density, it follows that probability mass in such theories always flows
locally through configuration space, and therefore that a classical
configuration of the system's (field) variables can still be made to evolve
locally in a way that simply tracks the flow of the conserved probability
current in configuration space. Therefore, Bohm's interpretation can be
extended to a relativistic version that works in such a way that it exactly
duplicates the predictions of standard quantum field theory, so, in fact,
there can be no experimental contradiction of Bohm's approach (if suitably
generalized in this way) that does not also contradict the standard
model.[citation needed]

## [edit] Understanding quantum mechanics

### [edit] Indeterminism in the Bohm Interpretation.

A major difference between Bohmâs interpretation and the usual one is the
approach to the indeterminism. In the usual interpretation, the SchrÃ¶dinger
equation is treated not as an actual field, but as a probability density
matrix (Born) which yields the resultant statistical data. According to the
founding fathers, there is no way to produce results which would be more exact
by referring to any âhidden variablesâ beyond the theory itself. Thus, in
the usual interpretation, there is what Bohm calls an âirreducible
lawlessnessâ which goes beyond our lack of knowledge or coarse graining.

For Bohm, on the other hand, the indeterminism implied by the theory is only
at the level of the macroscopic experimental apparatus (e.g. the observables),
and is not part of the nature of reality. Bohm expected that the underlying
motions of a sub-quantum domain could be more precisely defined than allowed
by the standard model, so that the degrees of freedom implied are considerably
reduced.

### [edit] Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that when two complementary
measurements are made, there is a limit to the product of their accuracy. As
an example, if one measures the position with an accuracy of Îx, and the
momentum with an accuracy of Îp, then \\Delta x\\Delta p\\gtrsim h. If we
make further measurements in order to get more information, we disturb the
system and change the trajectory into a new one depending on the measurement
set up; therefore, the measurement results are still subject to Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation.

In Bohm's interpretation, there is no uncertainty in position and momentum of
a particle; therefore a well defined trajectory is possible, but we have
limited knowledge of what this trajectory is (and thus of the position and
momentum). It is our knowledge of the particle's trajectory that is subject to
the uncertainty relation. What we know about the particle is described by the
same wave function that other interpretations use, so the uncertainty relation
can be derived in the same way as for other interpretations of quantum
mechanics.

To put the statement differently, the particles' positions are only known
statistically. As in classical mechanics, successive observations of the
particles' positions refine the initial conditions. Thus, with succeeding
observations, the initial conditions become more and more restricted. This
formalism is consistent with normal use of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. It is
the underlying chaotic behaviour of the hidden variables that allows the
defined positions of the Bohm theory to generate the apparent indeterminacy
associated with each measurement, and hence recover the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle.

For the derivation of the uncertainty relation, see Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, noting that it describes it from the viewpoint of the Copenhagen
interpretation.

### [edit] Two-slit experiment

The double-slit experiment is an illustration of wave-particle duality. In it,
a beam of particles (such as photons) travels through a barrier with two slits
removed. If one puts a detector screen on the other side, the pattern of
detected particles shows interference fringes characteristic of waves;
however, the detector screen responds to particles. The photons must exhibit
behaviour of both waves and particles.

The Copenhagen interpretation requires that the photons are not localised in
space until they are detected, and travel through both slits.

In the Bohm interpretation, the guiding wave travels through both slits and
sets up a Ï-field; the initial positions of the photons are not known to the
observer, but they travel under the guidance of the Ï-field. Each photon that
is detected has travelled through one of the slits; together, their statistics
show the probability distribution of the Ï-field, which gives interference
fringes that are characteristic of waves. The photons are localized particles
at all times, and hence are able to activate the detector screen.

### [edit] Measuring spin and polarization

It is not possible to measure the spin or polarization of a particle directly;
instead, the component in one direction is measured; the outcome from a single
particle may be 1, meaning that the particle is aligned with the measuring
apparatus, or -1, meaning that it is aligned the opposite way. For an ensemble
of particles, if we expect the particles to be aligned, the results are all 1.
If we expect them to be aligned oppositely, the results are all -1. For other
alignments, we expect some results to be 1 and some to be -1 with a
probability that depends on the expected alignment. For a full explanation of
this, see the Stern-Gerlach Experiment.

In the Bohm interpretation, we calculate the wave function that corresponds to
the setup of the apparatus (including the orientation of the detectors); the
particles are guided by this function, so we can calculate the probabilities
that the actual particles will reach each part of the detector apparatus.

### [edit] The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox

In the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox[5], the authors point out that it is
possible to create pairs of particles with quantum states that are mirror-
images of each other; these particles are now described as entangled. They
describe a thought-experiment showing that either quantum mechanics is an
incomplete theory or that it has nonlocality.

John Bell then described Bell's theorem (see p.14 in[6]), in which he shows
that all hidden-variable theories (including the Bohm interpretation) have
nonlocality. Bell went further, showing that quantum mechanics itself is
nonlocal and that this cannot be avoided by appealing to any alternative
interpretation (p. 196 in[7]): "It is known that with Bohm's example of EPR
correlations, involving particles with spin, there is an irreducible
nonlocality."

Alain Aspect took this further by creating Bell test experiments, which
realize the thought experiments on which Bell's theorem is based. He was able
to show experimentally that Bell's results hold.

In the Bell test experiment, entangled pairs of particles are created; the
particles are separated, travelling to remote measuring apparatus. The
orientation of the measuring apparatus can be changed while the particles are
in flight, demonstrating the non-locality of the effect. The apparatus makes a
statistical detection of the orientation of the particles (see Measuring spin
and polarization for a description of this). Bell's Theorem shows that the
results at each detector depend on the orientation of both detectors.

The Bohm interpretation describes this experiment as follows: to understand
the evolution of these particles, we need to set up a wave equation for both
particles; the orientation of the apparatus affects the wave function. The
particles in the experiment follow the guidance of the wave function; we don't
know the initial conditions of these particles, but we can predict the
statistical outcome of the experiment from the wave function. It is the wave
function that carries the faster-than-light effect of changing the orientation
of the apparatus.

## [edit] History

Bohm became dissatisfied with the conventional interpretation of quantum
mechanics, pointing out that, although it requires one to give up "the
possibility of even conceiving what might determine the behaviour of an
individual system at a quantum level", it doesn't prove that this requirement
is necessary.

To highlight this, Bohm published 'A Suggested Interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics in Terms of "Hidden" Variables' [Bohm 1952]. In this paper, Bohm
presented his alternative.

While preparing this paper, Bohm became aware of de Broglie's Pilot wave
theory. This was a hidden-variable theory which de Broglie presented at the
1927 Solvay Conference[8]. At the conference, Wolfgang Pauli pointed out that
it did not deal properly with the case of inelastic scattering. De Broglie was
persuaded by this argument, and abandoned this theory. Later, in 1932, John
von Neumann published a paper[9], claiming to prove that all hidden-variable
theories are impossible. This clearly applied to both de Broglie's and Bohm's
theories.

Bohm's paper was largely ignored by other physicists; surprisingly, it was not
supported by Albert Einstein (who was also dissatisfied with the prevailing
orthodoxy and had discussed Bohm's ideas with him before publication). So Bohm
lost interest in it.

The cause was taken up by John Bell. In "Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum
Mechanics" [Bell 1987], several of the papers refer to hidden variables
theories (which include Bohm's). Bell showed that Pauli's and von Neumann's
objections amounted to showing that hidden variables theories are nonlocal,
and that nonlocality is a feature of all quantum mechanical systems.

The Bohm interpretation is now considered by some to be a valid challenge to
the prevailing orthodoxy of the Copenhagen Interpretation, but it remains
controversial.

## [edit] Extensions

### [edit] Exploiting Nonlocality

Antony Valentini of the Perimeter Institute has extended the Bohm
Interpretation to include signal nonlocality that would allow entanglement to
be used as a stand-alone communication channel without a secondary classical
"key" signal to "unlock" the message encoded in the entanglement. This
violates orthodox quantum theory but it has the virtue that it makes the
parallel universes of the chaotic inflation theory observable in principle.

Valentini cites earlier work that shows that orthodox quantum theory
corresponds to "sub-quantal thermal equilibrium" for the hidden variables.

The larger theory is a non-equilibrium theory: in Bohm's ontology, the hidden
variable "particles" and "field configurations" receive their marching orders
from the Ï-wave, but do not directly react back on it (see Ch 14 of the
"Undivided Universe"); in Valentini's theory, this direct feedback of particle
on its guiding pilot wave introduces an instability, a feedback loop that
pushes the hidden variables out of thermal equilibrium "sub-quantal heat
death" (Valentini). The resulting theory becomes nonlinear and non-unitary.
The Born probability interpretation can no longer be sustained in this
emergence of new order in complex systems that P.W. Anderson has called "More
is different."

### [edit] Isomorphism to the many worlds interpretation

> Explicitly non-local. Bohm accepts that all the branches of the universal
wavefunction exist. Like Everett, Bohm held that the wavefunction is real
complex-valued field which never collapses. In addition Bohm postulated that
there were particles that move under the influence of a non-local "quantum-
potential" derived from the wavefunction (in addition to the classical
potentials which are already incorporated into the structure of the
wavefunction). The action of the quantum- potential is such that the particles
are affected by only one of the branches of the wavefunction. (Bohm derives
what is essentially a decoherence argument to show this, see section 7,#I
[B]).

> The implicit, unstated assumption made by Bohm is that only the single
branch of wavefunction associated with particles can contain self-aware
observers, whereas Everett makes no such assumption. Most of Bohm's adherents
do not seem to understand (or even be aware of) Everett's criticism, section
VI [1][10], that the hidden- variable particles are not observable since the
wavefunction alone is sufficient to account for all observations and hence a
model of reality. The hidden variable particles can be discarded, along with
the guiding quantum-potential, yielding a theory isomorphic to many-worlds,
without affecting any experimental results.

### [edit] Quantum trajectory method

Work by Robert Wyatt in the early 2000s attempted to use the Bohm "particles"
as an adaptive mesh that follows the actual trajectory of a quantum state in
time and space. In the "quantum trajectory" method, one samples the quantum
wave function with a mesh of quadrature points. One then evolves the
quadrature points in time according to the Bohm equations of motion. At each
time-step, one then re-synthesizes the wave function from the points,
recomputes the quantum forces, and continues the calculation. (Quick-time
movies of this for H+H2 reactive scattering can be found on the Wyatt group
web-site at UT Austin.) This approach has been adapted, extended, and used by
a number of researchers in the Chemical Physics community as a way to compute
semi-classical and quasi-classical molecular dynamics. A recent issue of the
Journal of Physical Chemistry A was dedicated to Prof. Wyatt and his work on
"Computational Bohmian Dynamics".

Eric Bittner's group at the University of Houston has advanced a statistical
variant of this approach that uses Bayesian sampling technique to sample the
quantum density and compute the quantum potential on a structureless mesh of
points. This technique was recently used to estimate quantum effects in the
heat-capacity of small clusters Nen for n~100.

There remain difficulties using the Bohmian approach, mostly associated with
the formation of singularities in the quantum potential due to nodes in the
quantum wave function. In general, nodes forming due to interference effects
lead to the case where \\frac{1}{R}\\nabla^2R\\rightarrow\\infty. This results
in an infinite force on the sample particles forcing them to move away from
the node and often crossing the path of other sample points (which violates
single-valuedness). Various schemes have been developed to overcome this;
however, no general solution has yet emerged.

There has also been recent work in developing Complex Bohmian trajectories
which satisfy isochronal relations.

### [edit] Quantum chaos

There are developments in quantum chaos. In this theory, there exist quantum
wave functions that are fractal and thus differentiable nowhere. While such
wave functions can be solutions of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, taken in its
entirety, they would not be solutions of Bohm's coupled equations for the
polar decomposition of Ï into Ï and S, (see Reformulating the SchrÃ¶dinger
equation). The breakdown occurs when expressions involving Ï or S become
infinite (due to the non-differentiability), even though the average energy of
the system stays finite, and the time-evolution operator stays unitary. As of
2005[update], it does not appear that experimental tests of this nature have
been performed.

### [edit] Other extensions

The theory can also easily be extended to include spin, as well as the
relativistic Dirac theory. In the latter case, such relativistic extensions
inherently involve an experimentally unobservable preferred frame, and this is
considered by many to be in tension with the "spirit" of special relativity.

As probability density and probability current can be defined for any set of
commuting operators, the Bohmian formalism is not limited to the position
operator.[12]

(November 2008)  
Q: Why should we consider this to be a separate theory when it looks
contrived, and gives the same measurable predictions as conventional quantum
mechanics?

A: Bohm's original aim was to demonstrate that hidden-variables theories are
possible, and his hope was that this demonstration could lead to new insights,
measurable predictions and experiments.[13] So far, the Bohm interpretation
has had these results:

  * it has shown that a hidden-variable theory is possible; this has highlighted that some parts of other interpretations (such as wave collapse) are part of the interpretation and not an inevitable part of physics.
  * it has highlighted the issue of nonlocality: it inspired John Stewart Bell to prove his now-famous theorem,[14] which in turn led to the Bell test experiments. These showed that all theories of quantum mechanics must address nonlocality.

Q: While orthodox quantum mechanics admits many observables on the Hilbert
space that are treated almost equivalently (much like the bases composed of
their eigenvectors), Bohm's interpretation requires one to pick a set of
"privileged" observables that are treated classically â namely the position.
How can this be justified, when there is no experimental reason to think that
some observables are fundamentally different from others?

A: Positions may be considered as a natural choice for the selection because
positions are most directly measurable. For example, one does not actually
measure the "spin" of a particle in the SternâGerlach experiment, but
instead measures the position of the light flashes on a detector. Often the
observed quantities are positions, e.g. of a measuring needle or of the
particles making up a computer display. And so there is justification for
making position privileged.

Q: The Bohmian models are nonlocal; how can this be reconciled with the
principles of special relativity? they make it highly nontrivial to reconcile
the Bohmian models with up-to-date models of particle physics, such as quantum
field theory or string theory, and with some very accurate experimental tests
of special relativity, without some additional explanation. On the other hand,
other interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as consistent histories or
the many-worlds interpretation, allow us to explain the experimental tests of
quantum entanglement without any nonlocality whatsoever.

A: It is questionable whether other interpretations of quantum theory are
local or are simply less explicit about nonlocality. See for example the EPR
type of nonlocality. And recent tests of Bell's Theorem add weight to the
belief that all quantum theories must abandon either the principle of locality
or counterfactual definiteness (the ability to speak meaningfully about the
definiteness of the results of measurements, even if they were not performed).

Finding a Lorentz-invariant expression of the Bohm interpretation (or any
nonlocal hidden-variable theory) has proved difficult, and it remains an open
question for physicists today whether such a theory is possible and how it
would be achieved.

There has been work in this area. See Bohm and Hiley: The Undivided Universe,
and [3], [4], and references therein.

Q: The wavefunction must "disappear" or "collapse" after a measurement, and
this process seems highly unnatural in the Bohmian models. The Bohmian
interpretation also seems incompatible with modern insights about decoherence
that allow one to calculate the "boundary" between the "quantum microworld"
and the "classical macroworld"; according to decoherence, the observables that
exhibit classical behavior are determined dynamically, not by an assumption.

A: Collapse is a main feature of von Neumann's theory of quantum measurement.
In the Bohm interpretation, a wave does not collapse; instead, a measurement
produces what Bohm called "empty channels" consisting of portions of the wave
that no longer affect the particle. This conforms to the principle of
decoherence, where a quantum system interacts with its environment to give the
appearance of wavefunction collapse. The Bohm interpretation does not require
a boundary between a quantum system and its classical environment.

Q: The Bohm interpretation involves reverse-engineering of quantum potentials
and trajectories from standard QM. Diagrams in Bohm's book are constructed by
forming contours on standard QM interference patterns and are not calculated
from his "mathematical" formulation. Recent experiments with photons
arXiv:quant-ph/0206196 v1 28 Jun 2002 favor standard QM over Bohm's
trajectories.

A: The Bohm interpretation takes the SchrÃ¶dinger equation even more seriously
than does the conventional interpretation. In the Bohm interpretation, the
quantum potential is a quantity derived from the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, not a
fundamental quantity. Thus, the interference patterns in the Bohm
interpretation are identical to those in the conventional interpretation. As
shown in [5] and [6], the experiments cited above only disprove a
misinterpretation of the Bohm interpretation, not the Bohm interpretation
itself.

Q: Hugh Everett says that Bohm's particles are not observable entities, but
surely they are - what hits the detectors and causes flashes?

A: Both Everett and Bohm treat the wavefunction as a complex-valued but real
field. Everett's Many-worlds interpretation is an attempt to demonstrate that
the wavefunction alone is sufficient to account for all our observations. When
we see the particle detectors flash or hear the click of a Geiger counter or
whatever then Everett interprets this as our wavefunction responding to
changes in the detector's wavefunction, which is responding in turn to the
passage of another wavefunction (which we think of as a "particle", but is
actually just another wave-packet). But no particle in the Bohm sense of
having a defined position and velocity is involved. For this reason Everett
sometimes referred to his approach as the "wave interpretation". Talking of
Bohm's approach, Everett says:

â Our main criticism of this view is on the grounds of simplicity - if one
desires to hold the view that Ï is a real field then the associated particle
is superfluous since, as we have endeavored to illustrate, the pure wave
theory is itself satisfactory.[15] â  
In this view, then, the Bohm particles are unobservable entities, similar to
and equally as unnecessary as, for example, the luminiferous ether was found
to be unnecessary in special relativity. We can remove the particles from
Bohm's theory and still account for all our observations. The unobservability
of the "hidden particles" stems from an asymmetry in the causal structure of
the theory; the wavefunction influences the position and velocity of the
hidden variables (i.e. the particles are influenced by a "force" exerted by
the wavefunction), but the hidden variables do not influence the time
development of the wavefunction (i.e. there is no analogue of Newton's third
law \-- the particles do not react back onto the wavefunction) Thus the
particles do not make their presence known in any way; as the theory says,
they are hidden.
