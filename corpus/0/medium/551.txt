### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a given system or region of
space per unit volume, or per unit mass, depending on the context, although
the latter is more formally specific energy [5].[clarification needed] In some
cases it is obvious from context which quantity is most useful: for example,
in rocketry, energy per unit mass is the most important parameter, but when
studying pressurized gas or magnetohydrodynamics the energy per unit volume is
more appropriate. In a few applications (comparing, for example, the
effectiveness of hydrogen fuel to gasoline) both figures are appropriate and
should be called out explicitly. (Hydrogen has a higher energy density per
unit mass than does gasoline, but a much lower energy density per unit volume)

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as pressure, and in many
circumstances is an exact synonym: for example, the energy density of the
magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and
the energy required to compress a gas may be determined by multiplying the
pressure of the compressed gas times its change in volume.

Selected Energy Densities Plot

In energy storage application the energy density relates the mass of an energy
store to its stored energy. The higher the energy density, the more energy may
be stored or transported for the same amount of mass. In the context of fuel
selection, that energy density of a fuel is also called the specific energy of
that fuel, though in general an engine using that fuel will yield less energy
due to inefficiencies and thermodynamic considerationsâhence the specific
fuel consumption of an engine will be greater than the reciprocal of the
specific energy of the fuel.[clarification needed]

The highest density sources of energy are fusion and fission. Fusion includes
energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form
of sunlight) but humans have not learned to make our own sustained fusion
power sources. Fission of U-235 in nuclear power plants will be available for
billions of years because of the vast supply of the element on earth [6]. Coal
and petroleum are the current primary energy sources in the U.S. but have a
much lower energy density. Burning local biomass fuels supplies household
energy needs (cooking fires, oil lamps, etc.) worldwide.

Energy density (how much energy you can carry) does not tell you about energy
conversion efficiency (net output per input) or embodied energy (what the
energy output costs to provide, as harvesting, refining, distributing, and
dealing with pollution all use energy). Like any process occurring on a large
scale, intensive energy use creates environmental impacts: for example, global
warming, nuclear waste storage, and deforestation are a few of the
consequences of supplying our growing energy demands from fossil fuels,
nuclear fission, or biomass.

By dividing by 3.6 the figures for megajoules per kilogram can be converted to
kilowatt-hours per kilogram. Unfortunately, the useful energy available by
extraction from an energy store is always less than the energy put into the
energy store, as explained by the laws of thermodynamics. No single energy
storage method boasts the best in specific power, specific energy, and energy
density. Peukert's Law describes how the amount of energy we get out depends
how quickly we pull it out.

### [edit] Energy densities excluding oxidisers

This table lists energy densities of fuels that require external oxidisers,
such as oxygen. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of
the oxygen required for the chemical reactions, as it is assumed to be freely
available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems give a higher energy
density than an equivalent system that must hold its own oxidiser.

## [edit] Energy density of electric and magnetic fields

Electric and magnetic fields store energy. In a vacuum, the (volumetric)
energy density (in SI units) is given by

     U = \\frac{\\varepsilon_0}{2} \\mathbf{E}^2 + \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\mathbf{B}^2 ,
where E is the electric field and B is the magnetic field. In the context of
magnetohydrodynamics, the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy
density behaves like an additional pressure that adds to the gas pressure of a
plasma.

In normal (linear) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

     U = \\frac{1}{2} \( \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{D} + \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \) ,
where D is the electric displacement field and H is the magnetizing field.

## [edit] Energy density of empty space

In physics, "vacuum energy" or "zero-point energy" is the volumetric energy
density of empty space. More recent developments have expounded on the concept
of energy in empty space.

Modern physics is commonly classified into two fundamental theories: quantum
field theory and general relativity. Quantum field theory takes quantum
mechanics and special relativity into account, and it's a theory of all the
forces and particles except gravity. General relativity is a theory of
gravity, but it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. Currently these two
theories have not yet been reconciled into one unified description, though
research into "quantum gravity" seeks to bridge this divide.

In general relativity, the cosmological constant is proportional to the energy
density of empty space, and can be measured by the curvature of space. It is
subsequently related to the age of the universe, and as energy expands
outwards with time its density changes.

Quantum field theory considers the vacuum ground state not to be completely
empty, but to consist of a seething mass of virtual particles and fields.
These fields are quantified as probabilitiesâthat is, the likelihood of
manifestation based on conditions. Since these fields do not have a permanent
existence, they are called vacuum fluctuations. In the Casimir effect, two
metal plates can cause a change in the vacuum energy density between them
which generates a measurable force.

Some believe that vacuum energy might be the "dark energy" (also called
Quintessence) associated with the cosmological constant in general relativity,
thought to be similar to a negative force of gravity (or antigravity).
Observations that the expanding universe appears to be accelerating seem to
support the cosmic inflation theoryâfirst proposed by Alan Guth in 1981âin
which the nascent universe passed through a phase of exponential expansion
driven by a negative vacuum energy density (positive vacuum pressure).

## [edit] Energy density of food

Energy density is the amount of energy (kilojoules or calories) per amount of
food, with food amount being measured in grams or milliliters of food. Energy
density is thus expressed in cal/g, kcal/g, J/g, kJ/g, cal/mL, kcal/mL, J/mL,
or kJ/mL. What is popularly referred to as the number of "Calories" in a
portion of food (invariably spelled with a capital C to show that it is the
food Calorie) is therefore the number of kilocalories (thousands of calories
with the small c) in the portion.

Energy density measures the energy released when the food is metabolised by a
healthy organism when it ingests the food (see food energy for calculation)
and the food is metabolized with oxygen, into waste products such as carbon
dioxide and water. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are the only sources of
energy for an individual abstaining from alcohol, and they make up ninety
percent of the dry weight of food.[13] Therefore, water content is the most
important factor in energy density. Carbohydrates and proteins provide four
calories per gram, whereas fat provides nine calories per gram, 2.25 times as
much energy. Foods that derive most of their energy from fat have a much
higher energy density than those that derive most of their energy from
carbohydrates or proteins, even if the water content is the same. Nutrients
with a lower absorption, such as fiber or sugar alcohols, lower the energy
density of foods as well. A moderate energy density would be 1.6 to 3 calories
per gram; salmon, lean meat, and bread would fall in this category. High-
energy foods would have more than three calories per gram and include
crackers, cheese, dark chocolate, and peanuts.[14] The energy density of a
food can be determined from the label by dividing the calories or joules by
the weight in grams.
