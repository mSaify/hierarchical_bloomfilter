Dasein is a German word famously used by Martin Heidegger in his magnum opus
Being and Time. The word Dasein was used by several philosophers before
Heidegger, with the meaning of "existence" or "presence". It is derived from
da-sein, which literally means being-there/here, though Heidegger was adamant
that this was an inappropriate translation of Dasein. In German, Dasein is the
German vernacular term for existence, as in I am pleased with my existence
(ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden). For Heidegger, however, it must not be
mistaken for a subject, that is something definable in terms of consciousness
or a self. Heidegger was adamant about this distinction, which carried on
Nietzsche's critique of the subject. Dasein, as a being that is constituted by
its temporality, illuminates and interprets the meaning of Being in Time. For
more information, see other related Heideggerian concepts, such as being-in-
the-world.

Heidegger used the concept of Dasein to uncover the primal nature of "Being"
(Sein) which Descartes and Kant left unexplored. Like Nietzsche, Heidegger
criticized the notion of substance, arguing that Dasein is always a being
engaged in the world. The fundamental mode of Being is not that of a subject
or of the objective but of the coherence of Being-in-the-world.

On Heidegger's account, traditional language, logical systems, and beliefs
obscure Dasein's nature from itself. Beings are Dasein even when they are
ontologically wrapped up in a tradition which obscures the authentic choice to
live within and transmit this tradition. In this case Dasein still
authentically chooses the tradition when it is confronted by a paradox within
the tradition and must choose to dismiss the tradition or dismiss the
experience of being confronted with choice.

Heidegger attempted to maintain the definition of Dasein as we all are, in our
average everydayness. Dasein does not spring into existence upon philosophical
exploration of itself. Heidegger intended Dasein as a concept, in order to
provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to be. When
Dasein contemplates this, what seems (absurdly) circular in ontic terms, is
recursive in ontological sense, because it brings the necessary appearance of
time to the center of attention.

In Being and Time, Heidegger opens by positing that the potentialities of
Dasein's Being extend beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in
the history of metaphysics. "Scientific research is not the only manner of
Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest.
Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other
entities [...]" What distinguishes Dasein from other existent entities is that
"[...] in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it." Dasein's very nature
poses a philosophical (or ontological) problem for it. Thus, we see Heidegger,
being Dasein, attempt to tackle this innate dilemma in his philosophical
works.

## [edit] Karl Jaspers' Dasein and Existenz

For Karl Jaspers, the term "Dasein" meant existence in its most minimal sense,
the realm of objectivity and science, in opposition to what Jaspers called
"Existenz", the realm of authentic being. Due to the drastically different use
of the term "Dasein" between the two philosophers, often confusion occurs in
students who have studied either Heidegger or Jaspers first and then moved on
to the next philosopher.

In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of
philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and
empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront
borders that an empirical (or scientific) method can simply not transcend. At
this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation,
or take a leap of faith toward what Jaspers calls Transcendence. In making
this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers
calls Existenz, and can finally experience authentic existence.

But if Existenz is a subjective state of being, how can it be evaluated and
analyzed by the individual? Jaspers suggests social interactions offer
guidelines that individuals either adopt or reject. In other words, Existenz
is a solitary state derived from the values of society. As with Sartreâs
idea of âmirrorsâ (âHell is other people!â), Jaspers writes of the
self as âreflection in someone elseâs authentic self.â Unless we know
what others think and expect of us, we cannot decide who we are or want to be.

Jaspers, therefore, presents a view in which all people depend upon society
for self-definition, even if the act of definition is a rejection of
societyâs values. No one is truly apart from society. In the extreme, a
hermit defines his or her self as a complete rejection of social structures,
but there is no âhermitâ without a society from which to seek shelter. As
a result, individuals experience a constant sensation of conflict: a desire to
define the self freely while requiring society for that definition.[1]
