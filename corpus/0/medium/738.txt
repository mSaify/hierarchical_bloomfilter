## [edit] Belief, knowledge and epistemology

The relationship between belief and knowledge is subtle. Believers in a claim
typically say that they know that claim. For instance, those who believe that
the Sun is a god will often report that they know that the Sun is a god.
However, the terms belief and knowledge are used differently by philosophers.
and it is a telling point concerning the nature of belief that most people
distinguish between what they know and what they believe, even though they
consider both kinds of statements to be true.

Epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge and belief. The primary
problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for
us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from Plato's dialogue Theaetetus,
philosophy has traditionally defined knowledge as justified true belief. The
relationship between belief and knowledge is that a belief is knowledge if the
belief is true, and if the believer has a justification (reasonable and
necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) for believing it is true.

A false belief is not considered to be knowledge, even if it is sincere. A
sincere believer in the flat earth theory does not know that the Earth is
flat. Similarly, a truth that nobody believes is not knowledge, because in
order to be knowledge, there must be some person who knows it.

Later epistemologists have questioned the "justified true belief" definition,
and some philosophers have questioned whether "belief" is a useful notion at
all. â¢ Beliefs are the assumptions we make about ourselves, about others in
the world and about how we expect things to be â¢ It is also how we think
things really are.

## [edit] Belief as a psychological theory

Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated
belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore
one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to
be more abstract in their analysis and much of the work examining the
viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of
belief (the proposition). So, like other propositional attitudes, belief
implies the existence of mental states and intentionality, both of which are
hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mind whose foundations and relation
to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into core beliefs (those which you may be
actively thinking about) and dispositional beliefs (those which you may
ascribe to but have never previously thought about). For example, if asked 'do
you believe tigers wear pink pajamas ?' a person might answer that they do
not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation
before.[2]

That a belief is a mental state has been seen, by some, as contentious. While
some philosophers have argued that beliefs are represented in the mind as
sentence-like constructs others have gone as far as arguing that there is no
consistent or coherent mental representation that underlies our common use of
the belief concept and that it is therefore obsolete and should be rejected.

This has important implications for understanding the neuropsychology and
neuroscience of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent or ultimately
indefensible then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes which
support it will fail. If the concept of belief does turn out to be useful,
then this goal should (in principle) be achievable.

Philosopher Lynne Rudder Baker has outlined four main contemporary approaches
to belief in her controversial book Saving Belief[3]

  * Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct \- Sometimes called the âmental sentence theoryâ, in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. Jerry Fodor is one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
  * Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions \- This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we use it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says 'I believe that snow is white' and however a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Most notably philosopher Stephen Stich has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
  * Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory which will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it \- Known as eliminativism, this view, (most notably proposed by Paul and Patricia Churchland), argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as the four humours theory of medicine, or the phlogiston theory of combustion. In these cases science hasnât provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar, in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
  * Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong, however treating people, animals and even computers as if they had beliefs, is often a successful strategy \- The major proponents of this view, Daniel Dennett and Lynne Rudder Baker, are both eliminativists in that they believe that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they donât go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the oppositionâs queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett the intentional stance, belief based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience although both may be explanatory at their own level.

## [edit] How beliefs are formed

Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and
actions. Beliefs form in a variety of ways.

  * We tend to internalize the beliefs of the people around us. Albert Einstein is often quoted as having said that "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where we live.[4] Most individuals believe the religion they were taught in childhood. [5]

  * People may adopt the beliefs of a charismatic leader, even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs, and produce actions that are clearly not in their own self-interest.[6]

  * The primary thrust of the advertising industry is that repetition forms beliefs, as do associations of beliefs with images of sex, love, and other strong positive emotions.[7]

  * Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person's beliefs.[8]

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs
form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even
against their own self-interest.

## [edit] Delusional beliefs

Delusions are defined as beliefs in psychiatric diagnostic criteria (for
example in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).
Psychiatrist and historian G. E. Berrios has challenged the view that
delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as "empty speech acts",
where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief
statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the
majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if
they were genuine beliefs.

In Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, the White Queen says, "Why,
sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."
This is often quoted in mockery of the common ability of people to entertain
beliefs contrary to fact.
