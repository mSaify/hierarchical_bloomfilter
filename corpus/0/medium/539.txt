Eudaimonia (Greek: Îµá½Î´Î±Î¹Î¼Î¿Î½Î¯Î±) is a classical Greek word commonly
translated as 'happiness'. Etymologically, it consists of the word "eu"
("good" or "well being") and "daimÅn" ("spirit" or "minor deity", used by
extension to mean one's lot or fortune). Although popular usage of the term
happiness refers to a state of mind, related to joy or pleasure, eudaimonia
rarely has such connotations, and the less subjective "human flourishing" is
often preferred as a translation.[1]

## [edit] Greek philosophy

Socrates' philosophy, as it is represented in Plato's early dialogues,
contains two related claims about eudaimonia. The first is the strong inter-
dependence of eudaimonia, virtue (aretÄ), and knowledge (epistemÄ): virtue
is a sort of knowledge, perhaps 'knowledge of good and bad', and it is this
knowledge that is required to reach the ultimate good, with eudaimonia being
the prime candidate for this ultimate good. The second, sometimes called
"psychological eudaimonism" or "Socratic intellectualism", is the claim that
the ultimate good, eudaimonia, is what all human desires and actions aim to
achieve.

Plato (left) and Aristotle (right) both have written on the subject of
eudaimonia

Plato's middle dialogues present a somewhat different position. In the
Republic, we find a moral psychology more complex than psychological
eudaimonism: we do not only desire our ultimate good; rather the soul, or
mind, has three motivating parts - a rational, spirited (approximately,
emotional), and appetitive part - and each of these parts has its own desired
ends. Eudaimonia, then, is not simply acquired through knowledge, it requires
the correct psychic ordering of this tripartite soul: the rational part must
govern the spirited and appetitive part, thereby correctly leading all desires
and actions to eudaimonia and the principal constituent of eudaimonia, virtue.

The pursuit of eudaimonia is the central theme of Aristotle's Nicomachean
Ethics. Aristotle claims that "every art and every scientific inquiry, and
similarly every action and purpose, may be said to aim at some good. Hence
'the good' has been well defined as that at which all things aim." According
to Aristotle, the hierarchy of human purposes aim at eudaimonia as the
highest, most inclusive end. This is the end to which everyone in fact aims.
Further, it is the only end towards which it is worth undertaking a means.
Eudaimonia is constituted, according to Aristotle, not by honor, or wealth, or
power, but by rational activity in accordance with virtue over a complete
life. Such activity manifests the virtues of character, including, honesty,
pride, friendliness, and wittiness; the intellectual virtues, such as
rationality in judgment; and non-sacrificial (i.e. mutually beneficial)
friendships and scientific knowledge (knowledge of things that are fundamental
and/or unchanging is the best).

Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that eudaimonia is the highest good. However,
unlike Aristotle, he identifies eudaimonia with pleasure. Epicurus presents
two main arguments. The first defends the claim that pleasure is the only
thing that people value for its own sake. The second, which fits in well with
Epicurus' empiricism, supposedly lies in one's introspective experience: one
immediately perceives that pleasure is good and that pain is bad, in the same
way that one immediately perceives that fire is hot. Thus, as something
immediately apparent, no further argument is needed to show the goodness of
pleasure or the badness of pain. Although all pleasures are good and all pains
evil, Epicurus does not believe that all pleasures are choiceworthy or all
pains unchoiceworthy. Instead, one should calculate what is in one's long-term
self-interest, and forgo what will bring pleasure in the short-term if doing
so will ultimately lead to pain in the long-term.

The Stoics believe that virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia.
Virtue consists of living according to Nature, so eudaimonia is achieved by
living according to Nature's will. However, no one (except the fictional
"sage") can ever achieve perfect virtÃ¹, and everyone is always equally and
completely vicious. The best a non-sage can do is to act "befittingly," or in
the same way that a perfectly virtuous sage would in the same situation. No
one will ever achieve perfect virtÃ¹, and therefore eudaimonia, but one can
approach it.[2]
