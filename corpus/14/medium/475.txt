## [edit] History

Microhouse has its roots in the minimal techno, glitch (both developed in the
early 90's), and house (developed in the mid-80's) genres of music. Its first
echoes appeared in the glitch album by German experimental artist Oval, in
1993. Like many contemporary electronic genres, Microhouse has many
influences, most notably techno and the "click and pop" garage house that has
emerged from Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass (or "Bleep"), glitch and minimal
techno. Contrasting with tech house, which is often thought of as 'house with
techno melodic elements', microhouse is more aptly described as 'housey
minimal techno' - a marriage of the funky and groovy backroom house elements
with glitch and the driving, repetitive sound of techno.

The first microhouse track to gain mainstream popularity by a non-glitch
artist was Isolee's 1999 anthem, 'Beau Mot Plage'. However, microhouse did not
begin to rapidly build in popularity until the early 2000s with the advent of
record labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, Spectral Sound, Fabric, Telegraph and
Force Inc. The term microhouse is usually credited to music journalist Philip
Sherburne, writing for the magazine The Wire in 2001, to describe, according
to Stelfox, "the spectral, hypnotic interpretation of classic Chicago grooves
emerging on labels such as Perlon, Kompakt, Playhouse, Ongaku, Klang
Elektronik and the Mille Plateaux family of imprints-most notably Force Tracks
and Force Inc- at the turn of the millennium."[1]

## [edit] Musicology

Microhouse strips house music down to a more minimal and sparse aesthetic, in
the same vein as tech house. Its relationship to house and tech house music
can be compared to the relationship between minimal techno and the harder
techno genres. Like house and techno, microhouse is built around a 4/4 time
signature. A noticeable difference between microhouse and house is the
replacement of typical house kick drums, hi-hats and other drum machine
samples with clicks, static, glitches, and small bits of noise. Microhouse
artists often experiment with different forms of sampling to achieve this
effect.

One characteristic feature of microhouse is the use of sampling: extremely
short ('micro') samples of the human voice, musical instruments, everyday
noises and computer created wave patterns are arranged to form complex
melodies (such as can be heard in Akufen's "Deck the House"). Vocals in
microhouse are often simplistic, nonsensical, and monotone in nature, although
some artists, such as Matthew Dear, combine singing with microhouse
production.

Microhouse is somewhat obscure when compared to other genres of house and
techno, but several cities including Melbourne, Berlin, Cologne, Paris,
Montreal, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Minneapolis, Detroit, Chicago,
DC and Portland have budding scenes, and with the minimal techno boom of the
mid-00s, is now gaining great popularity in German, French, Canadian, Italian
and Spanish clubs. Mainstream tech house records and CDs will occasionally
have microhouse or minimal reworks of tracks. On top of this, several tracks
have become major club hits over the years, and a few others have even gained
European radioplay.
