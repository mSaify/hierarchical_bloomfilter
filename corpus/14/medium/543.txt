Video podcast (sometimes shortened to vodcast or less commonly vidcast) is a
term used for the online delivery of video on demand video clip content via
Atom or RSS enclosures. The term is an evolution specialized for video, coming
from the generally audio-based podcast and referring to the distribution of
video where the RSS feed is used as a non-linear TV channel to which consumers
can subscribe using a PC, TV, set-top box, media center or mobile multimedia
device. Web television series are often distributed as video podcasts.

## [edit] Technology and history

From a web server, a video podcast can be distributed as a file or as a
stream. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Downloading
complete video podcasts in advance gives the user the ability to play the
video podcasts offline on, for example, a portable media player. A downloaded
version can be watched many times with only one download, reducing bandwidth
costs in this case. Streaming allows seeking (skipping portions of the file)
without downloading the full video podcast, better statistics and lower
bandwidth costs for the servers; however, users may have to face pauses in
playback caused by slow transfer speeds.

A podcast client may work with a separate, or integrated player. One such
example of the latter is iTunes, which is an unusual case of a web feed
aggregator being added to a media player rather than vice versa.

## [edit] Video Podcast Icon

An official icon for video podcasting has yet to be established. This has led
to the proposal of several independently created graphics. Most of them are
available under a Creative Commons license.

## [edit] Timeline

  * On 31 October 2003[1] Canadian film collective Rocket Ace Moving Pictures launches the serialized web-based video zombie comedy project Dead End Days at DeadEndDays.com while referred to by its creators as a "web-serial" throughout 2003 and 2004, it is adopted by the podcast community as a progenitor.[2] The creators retroactively add RSS features to the site.
