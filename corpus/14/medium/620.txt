This article is about the geometrical figure. For the Indian highway project,
see Golden Quadrilateral.

A golden rectangle is a rectangle whose side lengths are in the golden ratio,
1: \\varphi \\, (one-to-phi), that is, 1 : \\tfrac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} or
approximately 1:1.618.

A distinctive feature of this shape is that when a square section is removed,
the remainder is another golden rectangle; that is, with the same proportions
as the first. Square removal can be repeated infinitely, in which case
corresponding corners of the squares form an infinite sequence of points on
the golden spiral, the unique logarithmic spiral with this property.

According to astrophysicist and math popularizer Mario Livio, since the
publication of Luca Pacioli's Divina Proportione in 1509,[1] when "with
Pacioli's book, the Golden Ratio started to become available to artists in
theoretical treatises that were not overly mathematical, that they could
actually use,"[2] many artists and architects have proportioned their works to
approximate the form of the golden rectangle, which has been considered
aesthetically pleasing. The proportions of the golden rectangle have been
observed in works predating Pacioli's publication.[3]

A method to construct a golden rectangle. The square is outlined in red. The
resulting dimensions are in the ratio 1:\\varphi, the golden ratio.

A golden rectangle can be constructed with only straightedge and compass by
this technique:

  1. Construct a simple square
  2. Draw a line from the midpoint of one side of the square to an opposite corner
  3. Use that line as the radius to draw an arc that defines the height of the rectangle
  4. Complete the golden rectangle

## [edit] Applications

  * Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in Garches features a rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure that are closely approximate to golden rectangles.[4]
  * Jan Tschichold describes the use of the golden rectangle in medieval book designs
