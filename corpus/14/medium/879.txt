### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

    This is a selective list of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, listed by genre. For a complete list, ordered chronologically, see KÃ¶chel catalogue.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was prolific and wrote in many genres. Perhaps his
best-admired work is in opera, the piano concerto and sonata, the symphony,
and in the string quartet and string quintet. Mozart also wrote much work for
solo piano, other forms of chamber music, masses and other religious music,
and endless dances, divertimentos, and other forms of light entertainment.

## [edit] How Mozart's compositions are listed

  * The indication "K." or KV refers to "KÃ¶chel (Verzeichnis)", i.e. the (more or less) chronological (i.e. by composition date) catalog of Mozart's works by Ludwig von KÃ¶chel. Note that this catalog has been amended several times, leading to ambiguity over some KV numbers (see e.g. Symphony No. 25). A version of the KÃ¶chel catalog can be found here and here.
  * The compositions of Mozart listed below are grouped thematically, i.e. by type of composition. Not all thematic groups of Mozart's works have a separate numbering that is generally accepted: KÃ¶chel only numbers Symphonies (1 to 41), Piano concertos (1 to 27, leaving out some early transcriptions by Mozart) and a few other groups. On the other hand, for most chamber music and vocal music there is no such numbering (or at least no generally accepted one).
  * Only relatively few of Mozart's compositions have Opus numbers, as not so many of his compositions were published during his lifetime, so numbering by Opus number proves quite impractical for Mozart compositions.

## [edit] Symphonies

Mozart's symphonic production covers a 24 year interval, from 1764 to 1788.
According to most recent investigations, Mozart wrote not just the 41
symphonies reported in traditional editions, but up to 68 complete works of
this type. However, by convention, the original numbering has been retained,
and so his last symphony is still known as "No. 41". Some of the symphonies
(K. 297, 385, 550) were revised by the author after their first versions.

### [edit] Childhood symphonies (1764â1771)

These are the numbered symphonies from Mozart's early childhood.

  * Symphony No. 1 in E-flat major, K. 16
  * Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, K. 17 (spurious, attributed to Leopold Mozart)
  * Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, K. 18 (spurious, by Abel)
  * Symphony No. 4 in D major, K. 19
  * Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major, K. 22
  * Symphony No. 6 in F major, K. 43
  * Symphony No. 7 in D major, K. 45
  * Symphony No. 8 in D major, K. 48
  * Symphony No. 9 in C major, K. 73
  * Symphony No. 10 in G major, K. 74
  * Symphony No. 11 in D major, K. 84
  * Symphony No. 12 in G major, K. 110
  * Symphony No. 13 in F major, K. 112

There are also several "unnumbered" symphonies from this time period.

  * Symphony in F major, K. Anh. 223 (19a)
  * Symphony in G major, K. Anh. 221 (45a) "Old Lambach"
  * Symphony in F major, K. 76 (42a)
  * Symphony in B flat major, K. Anh. 214 (45b)
  * Symphony in F major, K. 81 (73l)
  * Symphony in D major, K. 97 (73m)
  * Symphony in D major, K. 95 (73n)
  * Symphony in B flat major, K. Anh. 216 (C11.03)
  * Symphony in C major, K. 96

### [edit] Salzburg-era symphonies (1771â1781)

These symphonies are sometimes subcategorized as "Early" (1771â1773) and
"Late" (1773â1775), and sometimes subcategorized as "Germanic" (with minuet)
or "Italian" (without minuet). None of these were printed during Mozart's
lifetime.

Although not counted as "symphonies" the three Divertimenti K. 136â138, in
3-movement Italian overture style, are sometimes indicated as "Salzburg
Symphonies" too.

  * Symphony No. 14 in A major, K. 114 (1771)
  * Symphony No. 15 in G major, K. 124 (1772)
  * Symphony No. 16 in C major, K. 128 (1772)
  * Symphony No. 17 in G major, K. 129 (1772)
  * Symphony No. 18 in F major, K. 130 (1772)
  * Symphony No. 19 in E-flat major, K. 132 (1772)
  * Symphony No. 20 in D major, K. 133 (1772)
  * Symphony No. 21 in A major, K. 134 (1772)
  * Symphony No. 22 in C major, K. 162 (1773)
  * Symphony No. 23 in D major, K. 181 (1773)
  * Symphony No. 24 in B-flat major, K. 182 (1773)
  * Symphony No. 25 in G minor, K. 183 (173d B) (1773)
  * Symphony No. 26 in E-flat major, K. 184 (1773)
  * Symphony No. 27 in G major, K. 199 (1773)
  * Symphony No. 28 in C major, K. 200 (1774)
  * Symphony No. 29 in A major, K. 201 (1774)
  * Symphony No. 30 in D major, K. 202 (1774)

### [edit] Late symphonies (1781â1791)

  * Symphony No. 31 "Paris" in D major, K. 297 (K. 300a) (1778)
  * Symphony No. 32 "Overture in the Italian style" in G major, K. 318 (1779)
  * Symphony No. 33 in B-flat major, K. 319 (1779)
  * Symphony No. 34 in C major, K. 338 (1780)
  * Symphony No. 35 "Haffner" in D major, K. 385 (1782)
  * Symphony No. 36 "Linz" in C major, K. 425 (1783)
  * Symphony No. 37 in G major, K. 444 (1783) 
    For years this was categorized as a Mozart symphony, but later scholarship determined that it was actually composed by Michael Haydn (Symphony No. 25), and Mozart wrote only the slow introduction for it.
  * Symphony No. 38 "Prague" in D major, K. 504 (1786)

The three final symphonies (Nos. 39â41) were completed in about three months
in 1788. It is quite likely that he hoped to publish these three works
together as a single opus, although actually they remained unpublished until
after his death. One or two of them might have been played in public in
Leipzig in 1789.

  * Symphony No. 39 in E-flat major, K. 543 (1788)
  * Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550 (1788)
  * Symphony No. 41 "Jupiter" in C major, K. 551 (1788)

## [edit] Concertos

### [edit] Piano concertos

Main article: Mozart Piano Concertos

Mozart's production for piano and orchestra are numbered from 1 to 27. The
first four numbered concertos are early works (Piano Concertos Nos 1-4
(Mozart)). The movements of these concertos are arrangements of keyboard
sonatas by various contemporary composers (Raupach, Honauer, Schobert, Eckart,
C.P.E. Bach). Concertos 7 and 10 are compositions for three and two pianos
respectively. The remaining twenty-one are original compositions for solo
piano and orchestra. Among them, fifteen were written in the years from 1782
to 1786, while in the last five years Mozart wrote just two more piano
concertos.

  * Rondo for piano and orchestra in A major, K. 386

### [edit] Violin concertos

Mozart's five violin concertos were written in Salzburg around 1775. They are
notable for the beauty of their melodies and the skillful use of the
expressive and technical characteristics of the instrument, though Mozart
probably never went through all the violin possibilities like others (e.g.
Beethoven and Brahms) did after him. (Alfred Einstein notes that the violin
concertoâlike sections in the serenades are more virtuosic than in the works
titled Violin Concertos.)

  * Violin Concerto No. 1 in B-flat major, K. 207 (1775)
  * Violin Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 211 (1775)
  * Violin Concerto No. 3 in G major, K. 216 (1775)
  * Violin Concerto No. 4 in D major, K. 218 (1775)
  * Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major, K. 219 (1775)

In addition, there are two works that are spuriously attributed to Mozart.

  * Violin Concerto in E-flat major , K. 268 (1780) (attributed to Johann Friedrich Eck)[1]
  * Violin Concerto in D major, K. 271a Kolb ("No. 7") (1777)

Mozart also penned an adagio and two stand-alone rondos for violin and
orchestra.

  * Adagio for violin and orchestra in E major, K. 261 (1776)
  * Rondo for violin and orchestra in B flat major, K. 269
  * Rondo for violin and orchestra in C major, K. 373

### [edit] Horn concertos

Arguably the most widely played concertos for horn, the four Horn Concertos
are a major part of most professional horn players' repertoire. They were
written for Mozart's lifelong friend Joseph Leutgeb. The concertos (especially
the fourth) were written as virtuoso vehicles that allow the soloist to show a
variety of abilities on the valveless horns of Mozart's day.

The Horn Concertos are characterized by an elegant and humorous dialogue
between the soloist and the orchestra. Many of the autographs contain jokes
aimed at the dedicatee.

  * Horn Concerto No. 1 in D major, K. 412 (1791)
  * Horn Concerto No. 2 in E-flat major, K. 417 (1783)
  * Horn Concerto No. 3 in E-flat major, K. 447 (c. 1784â87)
  * Horn Concerto No. 4 in E-flat major, K. 495 (1786)

### [edit] Other concertos

  * Bassoon Concerto in B-flat major, K. 191 (1774)
  * Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra, K. 299 (1778)
  * Oboe Concerto in C major, K. 314 (has come down to us as the second flute concerto, but was almost certainly an oboe concerto) (1777â78)
  * Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra in A major, K. 622 (1791)
  * Flute Concerto No. 1 in G major, K. 313 (1778)
  * Flute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 314 (1778) (An arrangement of the above Oboe Concerto).
  * Andante for Flute and Orchestra in C major, K. 315 (1778)
  * Concerto for Trumpet, K47a (lost)

#### [edit] Concertante symphonies

  * Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra K. 364 in E-flat major (1779)
  * Sinfonia Concertante for Oboe, Clarinet, Horn and Bassoon K. 297b in E-flat major Anh.9 and later Anh. C 14.01 (1778)

## [edit] Piano music

Mozart's earliest composition attempts begin with piano sonatas and other
piano pieces, as this is the instrument on which his musical education took
place. Almost everything that he wrote for piano was intended to be played by
himself (or by his sister, also a proficient piano player). Examples of his
earliest works are those found in Nannerl's Music Book. Between 1782 and 1786
he wrote 20 works for piano solo (including sonatas, variations, fantasias,
suites, fugues, rondo) and works for piano four hands and two pianos.

He also wrote for piano and violin (16 complete sonatas, plus several
fragments and two variation sets), where âmainly in the more mature yearsâ
the piano does not play just a support to the other solo instrument, but
builds a dialogue with it.

### [edit] String quartets

  * Quartetti Milanesi, K. 80 and K. 155â160 (1770â1773)

    This cycle, in three movements, is interesting as far as these works can be considered precursors of the later âmore completeâ string quartets. 
  * String Quartet No. 1 in G major, K. 80/73f (1770)
  * String Quartet No. 2 in D major, K. 155/134a (1772)
  * String Quartet No. 3 in G major, K. 156/134b (1772)
  * String Quartet No. 4 in C major, K. 157 (1772â73)
  * String Quartet No. 5 in F major, K. 158 (1772â73)
  * String Quartet No. 6 in B-flat major, K. 159 (1773)
  * String Quartet No. 7 in E-flat major, K. 160/159a (1773)

  * Vienna Quartets, K. 168â173 (1773)

    Much more stylistically developed. In Vienna Mozart is believed to have heard the op. 17 and op. 20 quartets of Joseph Haydn, and had received from them a deep impression. 
  * String Quartet No. 8 in F major, K. 168 (1773)
  * String Quartet No. 9 in A major, K. 169 (1773)
  * String Quartet No. 10 in C major, K. 170 (1773)
  * String Quartet No. 11 in E-flat major, K. 171 (1773)
  * String Quartet No. 12 in B-flat major, K. 172 (1773)
  * String Quartet No. 13 in D minor, K. 173 (1773)

  * Haydn Quartets K. 387, 421, 428, 458, 464, 465, Opus 10 (1782â1785)

    Mozart returned to the quartet in the early 1780s after he had moved to Vienna, met Haydn in person, and developed a friendship with the older composer. Haydn had just published his set of six quartets Opus 33, which are thought to have been a stimulus to Mozart in returning to the genre. These quartets are often regarded as among the pinnacles of the genre. 
  * String Quartet No. 14 in G major, ("Spring") K. 387 (1782)
  * String Quartet No. 15 in D minor, K. 421/417b (1783)
  * String Quartet No. 16 in E-flat major, K. 428/421b (1783)
  * String Quartet No. 17 in B-flat major ("Hunt"), K. 458 (1784)
  * String Quartet No. 18 in A major, K. 464 (1785)
  * String Quartet No. 19 in C major ("Dissonance"), K. 465 (1785)

  * String Quartet No. 20 in D major ("Hoffmeister"), K. 499 (1786)

    This work was published by (dedicated to?) Franz Anton Hoffmeister, as well as the Prussian Quartets. Mozart's last three quartets, dedicated to the King of Prussia Friedrich Wilhelm II, are noted for the cantabile character of the parts for cello (the instrument played by the king himself), the sweetness of sounds and the equilibrium among the different instruments.
  * Prussian Quartets K. 575, 589, 590 (1789â1790)

    
  * String Quartet No. 21 in D major, K. 575 (1789)
  * String Quartet No. 22 in B-flat major, K. 589 (1790)
  * String Quartet No. 23 in F major, K. 590 (1790)

### [edit] String quintets

The string quintets (K. 174, 406, 515, 516, 593, 614), for two violins, two
violas and cello. Charles Rosen wrote that "by general consent, Mozart's
greatest achievement in chamber music is the group of string quintets with two
violas."[2].

  * String Quintet in B-flat major, K. 174
  * String Quintet in C major, K. 515
  * String Quintet in G minor, K. 516
  * String Quintet in C minor, K. 406 (516b)

    This is a transcription for string quintet of the earlier Serenade for wind octet in C minor (K. 388).
  * String Quintet in D major, K. 593
  * String Quintet in E-flat major, K. 614

(like the early Divertimenti K. 136â138), as well as for wind instruments
ensembles and the varied combinations of string and wind.

### [edit] Dances

See also: Mozart and dance

Mozart left a huge production of dances for orchestra, including the genres of
Minuetto (more than 100), Contredanse and Allemande (or Teitsch, or Laendler,
or German Dances).

In his production of minuets, Mozart generally followed Haydn's example,
preferring the slow character of the dance. Allemandes (56 between 1787 and
1791) were written mainly for public balls in Vienna. In the Contredanse
production, also written mainly in Vienna, some examples of program music are
found, like Il Temporale K. 534, La Bataille K. 535, Canary K. 600/5, etc.

## [edit] Sacred music

Mozart's sacred music is mainly vocal, though also instrumental examples
exist, like the Sonate da Chiesa for 2 violins, double bass and organ,
composed between 1767 and 1780.

Mozart's sacred music presents a rich stylistic mosaic: Gregorian choral
elements meet rigorous counterpoint, and even operatic elements can sometimes
emerge. Stylistic unity and consistency is present over all his sacred music
work.

We include in this genre, for their liturgical character, also the
compositions written for the Masonic Lodge, like The Cantata Laut Verkunde
unsre Freude K623 and the Maurerische Trauermusik (Masonic Funeral Music)
K477.
