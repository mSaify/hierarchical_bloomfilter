Basic English is an English-based controlled language created by Charles Kay
Ogden (in essence a simplified subset of English) as an international
auxiliary language, and as an aid for teaching English as a Second Language.
It was presented in Ogden's book Basic English: A General Introduction with
Rules and Grammar (1930). Basic English is sometimes referred to as BASIC, an
acronym that stands for British American Scientific International Commercial.
However it has no connection to the BASIC programming language.

Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest
publicity just after the Allied victory in the Second World War as a tool for
world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar
simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's
associate I. A. Richards promoted its use in schools in China. More recently,
it has influenced the creation of Voice of America's Special English for news
broadcasting, and Simplified English, another English based controlled
language designed to write technical manuals.

What survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850 word list used
as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught world-wide,
especially Asia.[1]

## [edit] Design principles

Ogden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers,
by specifying grammar restrictions and a controlled small vocabulary which
makes an extensive use of paraphrasis. Most notably, Ogden eliminated verbs,
saying in his General Introduction that "There are no 'verbs' in Basic
English", with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very
straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs
would be a welcome simplification.[2]

## [edit] Historical references

In the future history book The Shape of Things to Come, published in 1933,
H.G. Wells depicted Basic English as the lingua franca of a new elite which
after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a
totalitarian world government. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually
all members of humanity know this language (for a similar real-world
development, see Engrish).

From 1942 until 1944 George Orwell was a proponent of Basic English, but in
1945 he became critical of universal language. The language later inspired his
use of Newspeak in Nineteen Eighty-Four.[3] Noted science fiction author
Robert A. Heinlein used a form of Basic English in his story "Gulf" as a
language appropriate for a race of genius supermen.[4]

## [edit] Word lists

Ogden's word lists include only word roots, which in practice are extended
with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any
available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs).[5]

The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's Appendix:Basic
English word list. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life.
However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150 word
list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a word list of 100
words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business,
etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialized subset of that
general field, to make a basic 1000 word vocabulary for everyday work and
life.

Moreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and
thus may only review) a core subset of around 350 "international" words.
Therefore, a first level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of
around 1350 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain 1500
words (the core 850 words, plus 350 international words, and 300 words for the
general fields of trade, economics, and science). A sample 1500 word
vocabulary is included in the Simple English Wikipedia.

Ogden also provided lists to extend the general 1500 vocabulary with
additional word lists to make a 2000 word list, enough for a "standard"
English level. This 2000 word vocabulary represents "what any learner should
know". At this level students could start to move on their own.

## [edit] Criticism

Like all IALs, Basic may be criticized as unavoidably based on personal
preferences, and thus, paradoxically, as inherently divisive.[6] Moreover,
like all natural language based IALs, Basic is subject to criticism as
unfairly biased towards the native speaker community.[7]

As a teaching aid for English as a Second Language, Basic has been criticized
for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.[8]
