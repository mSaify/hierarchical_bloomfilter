In computer jargon, to slipstream updates, patches or service packs means to
integrate them into the installation files of their original software, so that
the resulting files will allow a direct installation of the updated software.

If not directly supported by the software vendor, slipstreaming can be
technically possible, depending on the updates, the structure and type of the
program to be slipstreamed and of its installer, if any.

In Windows environments, it is common for system administrators to make
slipstreamed installation sources of the operating system available on network
shares. That greatly simplifies deployment for new installations. Microsoft
also usually allows ordering slipstreamed CDs from their website. Newer
versions of Microsoft products usually come either already slipstreamed or
with a separate CD holding some updates.

Slipstreaming can save time and money. It is possible to add service packs and
other updates and patches to the install source, as well as extra drivers. In
a Windows environment, slipstreaming all needed drivers onto the install
source will save time downloading them from the Internet. However, if newer
drivers are available then a new install source would be needed. It also
involves more work initially, but can save time later on in reinstallation
terms. This is especially significant for administrators that have to manage a
large number of computers, where the default case for installing an operating
system on each computer would be to use the original media and then update
each computer after the installation was complete, as opposed to using a more
up-to-date (slipstreamed) source, and having to download/install a minimal
number of updates.

Adding patches to the install source is also another time saver.[citation
needed] However, not all (Windows) patches can be applied in this fashion and
one disadvantage is that if it is discovered that a certain patch is
responsible for later problems, said patch cannot be removed without using an
original, non-slipstreamed install CD. Online instructions for this way of
doing things emphasise the use of virtual PC environments (such as VMware
Workstation or VirtualBox) for testing, as the end user often gets no support
from the program manufacturer for using these "homemade" CDs.

Using slipstreamed OS CDs (e.g. XP Pro) can avoid installation errors caused
by drivers and hardware components.
