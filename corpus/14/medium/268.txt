Blum Blum Shub (B.B.S.) is a pseudorandom number generator proposed in 1986 by
Lenore Blum, Manuel Blum and Michael Shub (Blum et al, 1986).

Blum Blum Shub takes the form:

    xn+1 = (xn)2 mod M
where M=pq is the product of two large primes p and q. At each step of the
algorithm, some output is derived from xn; the output is commonly either the
bit parity of xn or one or more of the least significant bits of xn.

The two primes, p and q, should both be congruent to 3 (mod 4) (this
guarantees that each quadratic residue has one square root which is also a
quadratic residue) and gcd(Ï(p-1), Ï(q-1)) should be small (this makes the
cycle length large).

An interesting characteristic of the Blum Blum Shub generator is the
possibility to calculate any xi value directly (via Euler's Theorem):

     x_i = \\left\( x_0^{2^i \\bmod \(p-1\)\(q-1\)} \\right\) \\bmod M.

## [edit] Security

The generator is not appropriate for use in simulations, only for
cryptography, because it is very slow. However, it has an unusually strong
security proof, which relates the quality of the generator to the
computational difficulty of integer factorization. When the primes are chosen
appropriately, and O(log log M) lower-order bits of each xn are output, then
in the limit as M grows large, distinguishing the output bits from random will
be at least as difficult as factoring M.

If integer factorization is difficult (as is suspected) then B.B.S. with large
M will have an output free from any nonrandom patterns that can be discovered
with any reasonable amount of calculation. This makes it as secure as other
encryption technologies tied to the factorization problem, such as RSA
encryption.

## [edit] Example

Let p = 11, q = 19 and s = 3. We can expect to get a large cycle length for
those small numbers, because gcd(Ï(p â 1),Ï(q â 1)) = 2. The generator
starts to evaluate x0 by using x â 1 = s and creates the sequence x0, x1,
x2, \\ldots x5 = 9, 81, 82, 36, 42, 92. The following table shows different
output bits of different bit is used to determine the output.
