In mammals, the adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are the star-
shaped endocrine glands that sit on top of the kidneys; their name indicates
that position (ad-, "near" or "at" + renes, "kidneys"; and as concerns supra-,
meaning "above"). They are chiefly responsible for regulating the stress
response through the synthesis of corticosteroids and catecholamines,
including cortisol and adrenaline (epinephrine), respectively.

## [edit] Anatomy and function

Anatomically, the adrenal glands are located in the thoracic abdomen situated
at the top of the kidneys, specifically on their anterosuperior aspect. They
are also surrounded by the adipose capsule and the renal fascia. In humans,
the adrenal glands are found at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra and
receive their blood supply from the adrenal arteries. The adrenal gland is
separated into two distinct structures, both of which receive regulatory input
from the nervous system:

### [edit] Adrenal medulla

The adrenal medulla is the central core of the adrenal gland, surrounded by
the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main
source of the catecholamine hormones adrenaline (epinephrine) and
noradrenaline (norepinephrine). These water-soluble hormones, derived from the
amino acid tyrosine, are part of the fight-or-flight response initiated by the
sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal medulla can be considered specialized
ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system, lacking distinct synapses, instead
releasing secretions directly into the blood. It is also the main source of
dopamine, a catecholamine closely related to adrenaline and noradrena

### [edit] Adrenal cortex

The adrenal cortex is devoted to the synthesis of corticosteroid hormones from
cholesterol. Some cells belong to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and
are the source of cortisol synthesis. Under normal unstressed conditions, the
adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35-40mg of cortisone acetate per
day.[1] Other cortical cells produce androgens such as testosterone, while
some regulate water and electrolyte concentrations by secreting aldosterone.
In contrast to the direct innervation of the medulla, the cortex is regulated
by neuroendocrine hormones secreted by the pituitary gland and hypothalamus,
as well as by the renin-angiotensin system.

The cortex is divided into three zones, or layers. This division is sometimes
referred to as "functional zonation". Moving from the outermost layer in:

Zona glomerulosa

    The zona glomerulosa is the main site for production of mineralocorticoids, namely aldosterone, which plays an important role in the body's sodium homeostasis.
Zona fasciculata

    The zona fasciculata is responsible for producing glucocorticoids, chiefly cortisol in humans. Cortisol secretion is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary, by binding to a cell surface receptor and in turn increasing intracellular cAMP. In the absence of ACTH, the zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol.
Zona reticularis

    The zona reticularis produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in humans.
### [edit] Arteries and veins

Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and indeed the
kidneys themselves) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply
each adrenal gland:

  * The superior suprarenal artery is provided by the inferior phrenic
  * The middle suprarenal artery is provided by the abdominal aorta
  * The inferior suprarenal artery is provided by the renal artery

Venous drainage of the adrenal glands is achieved via the suprarenal veins:

  * The right suprarenal vein drains into the inferior vena cava
  * The left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein or the left inferior phrenic vein.

The suprarenal veins may form anastomoses with the inferior phrenic veins.

The adrenal glands and the thyroid gland are the organs that have the greatest
blood supply per gram of tissue. Up to 60 arterioles may enter each adrenal
gland.[2]
