# Communications protocol

### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

This article is about communication between pairs of electronic devices. For
the specific topic of computing protocols, see Protocol (computing). For
protocols on two-way voice communications, see Voice procedure.

In the field of telecommunications, a communications protocol is the set of
standard rules for data representation, signaling, authentication and error
detection required to send information over a communications channel. An
example of a simple communications protocol adapted to voice communication is
the case of a radio dispatcher talking to mobile stations. Communication
protocols for digital computer network communication have features intended to
ensure reliable interchange of data over an imperfect communication channel.
Communication protocol is basically following certain rules so that the system
works properly.

## [edit] Standards organizations

Most recent protocols are assigned by the IETF for Internet communications,
and the IEEE, or the ISO for other types. The ITU-T handles telecommunications
protocols and formats for the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The
ITU-R handles protocols and formats for radio communications. As the PSTN.
radio systems, and Internet converge, the different sets of standards are also
being driven towards technological convergence.

For marine electronics the NMEA standards are used.
