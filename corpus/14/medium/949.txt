### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

International standard ISO 5218 defines a representation of human sexes
through a language-neutral single-digit code. It can be used in information
systems such as database applications.

The four codes specified in ISO 5218 are:

  * 0 = not known,
  * 1 = male,
  * 2 = female,
  * 9 = not applicable.

The standard specifies that its use may be referred to by the designator
"SEX".

The standard explicitly states that no significance is to be placed on the
fact that male is encoded as 1 and female as 2. The encoding merely reflects
existing practice in the countries that initiated this standard.

ISO 5218 was created by ISO's Data Management and Interchange Technical
Committee and proposed in November 1976, and updated in July 2004.

This standard is used in several national identification numbers. For example,
the first digit of the French INSEE number, the first digit of the Republic of
China national identification card (Chinese: ä¸­è¯æ°ååæ°èº«åè­) and
the first digit of so-called Personal Number that was in use until 1991 in
Hungary all use ISO 5218 values.
