# Semantic Web Rule Language

### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is a proposal for a Semantic Web rules-
language, combining sublanguages of the OWL Web Ontology Language (OWL DL and
Lite) with those of the Rule Markup Language (Unary/Binary Datalog).

The specification was submitted in May 2004 to the W3C by the National
Research Council of Canada, Network Inference (since acquired by webMethods),
and Stanford University in association with the Joint US/EU ad hoc Agent
Markup Language Committee.

Compared with DLP (Description Logic Programs), another relatively recent
proposal in the Semantic Web community for integrating rules and OWL, SWRL
takes a diametrically opposed integration approach. DLP is the intersection of
Horn logic and OWL, whereas SWRL is (roughly) the union of them. In DLP, the
resultant language is a very peculiar looking description logic and rather
inexpressive language overall. Itâs hard to see the restrictions are either
natural or satisfying. Contrariwise, SWRL retains the full power of OWL DL,
but at the price of decidability and practical implementations.[1]

Rules are of the form of an implication between an antecedent (body) and
consequent (head). The intended meaning can be read as: whenever the
conditions specified in the antecedent hold, then the conditions specified in
the consequent must also hold.

## [edit] Example

Human Readable Syntax

    
    hasParent(?x1,?x2) â§ hasBrother(?x2,?x3) â hasUncle(?x1,?x3)
    
XML Concrete Syntax

The XML Concrete Syntax is a combination of the OWL Web Ontology Language XML
Presentation Syntax with the RuleML XML syntax.

    
    <ruleml:imp> 
     <ruleml:_rlab ruleml:href="#example1"/>
     <ruleml:_body> 
       <swrlx:individualPropertyAtom  swrlx:property="hasParent"> 
         <ruleml:var>x1</ruleml:var>
         <ruleml:var>x2</ruleml:var>
       </swrlx:individualPropertyAtom> 
       <swrlx:individualPropertyAtom  swrlx:property="hasBrother"> 
         <ruleml:var>x2</ruleml:var>
         <ruleml:var>x3</ruleml:var>
       </swrlx:individualPropertyAtom> 
     </ruleml:_body> 
     <ruleml:_head> 
       <swrlx:individualPropertyAtom  swrlx:property="hasUncle"> 
         <ruleml:var>x1</ruleml:var>
         <ruleml:var>x3</ruleml:var>
       </swrlx:individualPropertyAtom> 
     </ruleml:_head> 
    </ruleml:imp> 
    
RDF Concrete Syntax

It is straightforward to provide such an RDF concrete syntax for rules, but
the presence of variables in rules goes beyond the RDF Semantics[2].
Translation from the XML Concrete Syntax to RDF/XML could be easily
accomplished by extending the XSLT transformation for the OWL XML Presentation
syntax.

## [edit] Implementations

Caveat: Reasoners do not support the full specification because the reasoning
becomes undecidable. There can be three types of approach: translate SWRL into
First Order Logic (Hoolet) and demonstrate reasoning tasks with a theorem
prover; translate OWL-DL into rules and give the rules to a forward chaining
engine (Bossam) (this approach cannot cover the full expressivity of OWL-DL
due to many incompatibility between Description Logic and Horn Rule
formalisms); expand an existing OWL-DL reasoner based on the tableaux
algorithm (Pellet).

<IMG> This section requires expansion.  
  * SWRLTab is an extension to Protege that supports editing and execution of SWRL rules. [1]
  * R2ML (REWERSE Rule Markup Language) supports SWRL. [2]
  * Bossam, a forward chaining rule engine supports SWRL. [3]
  * Hoolet, an implementation of an OWL-DL reasoner that uses a first order prover supports SWRL. [4]
  * Pellet, an open-source Java OWL DL reasoner has SWRL-support. [5]
  * KAON2 is an infrastructure for managing OWL-DL, SWRL, and F-Logic ontologies. [6]
  * RacerPro, supports processing of rules in a SWRL-based syntax by translating them into nRQL rules [7]
