Little Britain is a character-based comedy sketch show first appearing on BBC
radio and then television. It was written by stars Matt Lucas and David
Walliams. Its title is an amalgamation of the terms 'Little England' and
'Great Britain', and is also the name of a Victorian neighbourhood and modern
street in London.[1]

The show comprises sketches involving exaggerated parodies of British people
from all walks of life in various situations familiar to the British. These
sketches are presented to the viewer together with narration in a manner which
suggests that the programme is a guide - aimed at non-British people - to the
ways of life of various classes of British society. Despite the narrator's
description of great British institutions, the comedy is derived from the
British audience's self-deprecating understanding of either themselves or
people known to them.

An American version of the show, entitled Little Britain USA was created in
2008. This series is shown on HBO in the USA, & also shown in Canada. It is
shown on the BBC in the UK.

Many of the characters on the show have their own often-repeated catchphrases.
Many have become well-known in the United Kingdom, and the show has gained a
mainstream following.

## [edit] History

### [edit] Radio Show

Little Britain initially appeared as a radio show on BBC Radio 4.

Radio 4 began a rerun of all nine episodes in February 2004. Unusually, this
overlapped with a rerun on digital radio channel BBC 7 of the first five,
which began in mid-March. In JuneâJuly 2004, BBC 7 broadcast the remaining
four.

Lou Todd and Andy Pipkin, recurring characters in the series

Like several other BBC comedy shows (such as Dead Ringers and The Mighty
Boosh), Little Britain made the transition from radio to television. All the
episodes for the series were filmed at Pinewood Studios. Much of the TV
material was adapted from the radio version, but with more emphasis on
recurring characters and catchphrases.

Series One, 2003

As a result of its success, the first television series was repeated on the
more mainstream channel BBC Two. Although reactions were mixed, many critics
were enthusiastic, and the show was commissioned for another run.

Series Two, 2004

The second TV series, featuring several new characters, began on BBC Three 19
October 2004. Because of its popularity, the scheduled repeats were "promoted"
to BBC One, starting 3 December 2004, which guaranteed higher ratings.
However, the episodes were edited for their BBC One run, as the material was
deemed too offensive for the BBC One audience.

Series Three, 2005

A third series began on 17 November 2005 on BBC One, and ended six weeks
later. After its transmission, it was unclear whether there would be another,
as so many sketches were given dramatic twists and "wrapped up" â (see
individual character articles). Lucas and Walliams were reportedly in talks
for a fourth series with the BBC. Furthermore, they admitted in an interview
they preferred to "kill off" certain characters in order to make way for new
ones.

Little, Little Britain, 2005

In 2005, to raise money for Comic Relief, Walliams and Lucas made a special
edition of the show, dubbed Little, Little Britain. The episode included a
variety of sketches with celebrities including George Michael, Robbie Williams
and Sir Elton John. This was released on a limited edition DVD and was
released in the United States as Little, Little Britain on the region 1
version of the Little Britain: Season 2 DVD.

Little Britain Abroad, 2006

In 2006, two Christmas specials were released. In each, characters from the
show were depicted as visiting other countries.

### [edit] Little Britain Live

    See Little Britain Live
As a success of the television series, Lucas and Walliams created a travelling
stage show based upon their series.

Comic Relief Does Little Britain Live, 2007

A special live version, featuring appearances from celebrities such as Russell
Brand and Dennis Waterman was filmed in 2006 and appeared on 2007's Comic
Relief show.

### [edit] Little Britain USA

In 2007, Matt Lucas and David Walliams announced that the British Little
Britain will no longer continue, however they have filmed an American version
of the show entitled Little Britain USA, which will feature both returning
characters from the British series as well as new American ones.[2] According
to David Walliams, the new show is "effectively Little Britain season
four."[3] The show debuted on HBO at 10:30 pm EST Sunday 28 September 2008,
then the following week on BBC One in Britain.

### [edit] Other

Matt Lucas and Peter Kay, in the guise of their characters Andy Pipkin and
Brian Potter, re-recorded the song "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" with its
creators, The Proclaimers. This version was released as a charity single for
Comic Relief on 19 March 2007.

## [edit] Cast

Samantha Power, Yuki Kushida, and Stirling Gallacher regularly appear as
several different characters.

Myfanwy, Charu Bala Chokshi as Meera, and Joann Condon as Fat Pat.

### [edit] Guest appearances

## [edit] Main characters

Main article: Little Britain characters

As a sketch show, Little Britain features many characters; most are played by
Lucas and Walliams with varying degrees of costume and makeup.

## [edit] Episodes

Main article: List of Little Britain episodes

As of December 2006, charity specials, and a two part Christmas special known
as Little Britain Abroad, which was broadcast in December 2006. This makes a
total of 25 episodes to date. There has also been the Little Britain Live
show.

## [edit] Criticism

The series, and in particular its second and third season, have been
criticised for their perceived treatment of minority groups. For example,
Johann Hari, writing in The Independent, stated:

â "Little Britain has been a vehicle for two rich kids to make themselves
into multi-millionaires by mocking the weakest people in Britain. Their
targets are almost invariably the easiest, cheapest groups to mock: the
disabled, poor, elderly, gay or fat. In one fell swoop, they have demolished
protections against mocking the weak that took decades to build up."[4] â  
Similarly, Fergus Sheppard wrote in The Scotsman:

â "The latest series of the hit BBC comedy Little Britain may be hauling in
record viewing figures, but it has also sparked a previously unthinkable
chorus of criticism, with claims that the show has lost its way, trading early
ingenuity for swelling amounts of toilet humour in the search for cheap
laughs, and becoming increasingly offensive."[5] â  
The programme has become increasingly popular with children, despite being
shown after the watershed. There has also been criticism from teachers that
the programme leads to copycat behaviour in the playground.[6]

Many of the sketches seem to be very repetitive, leading many people to
criticise 'Little Britain USA' as simply being a repeat of sketches from the
original series this time set in the USA only with minor differences.

## [edit] Singles

The song, "I'm Gay", that Matt Lucas' character Daffyd Thomas sang at the end
of the Live Stage Shows was released as a single and is available to download
on iTunes.
