(March 2009)  
A CPU socket or CPU slot is a connector on a motherboard that accepts a CPU
and forms an electrical interface with it. As of 2007, most desktop and server
computers, particularly those based on the Intel x86 architecture, include
socketed processors.

Most CPU-sockets interfaces are based on the pin grid array (PGA)
architecture, in which short, stiff pins on the underside of the processor
package mate with holes in the socket. To minimize the risk of bent pins, zero
insertion force (ZIF) sockets allow the processor to be inserted without any
resistance, then grip the pins firmly to ensure a reliable contact after a
lever is flipped.

As of 2007[update], land grid array (LGA) sockets are becoming increasingly
popular, with several current and upcoming socket designs using this scheme.
With LGA sockets, the socket contains pins that make contact with pads or
lands on the bottom of the processor package. While not popular for many
years, LGAs are not new; the Intel 80286 (introduced ca. 1983) was offered in
a ceramic LGA version.

In the late 1990s, many x86 processors fit into slots, rather than sockets.
CPU slots are single-edged connectors similar to expansion slots, into which a
PCB holding a processor is inserted. Slotted CPU packages offered two
advantages: L2 cache memory could be upgraded by installing an additional chip
onto the processor PCB, and processor insertion and removal was often easier.

## [edit] List of sockets and slots

Many socket names containing three-digit numbers represent the number of pins
on the processor or socket.

  4. ^ a b c d These sockets are for CPUs with integrated memory controllers. The 754-pin models have a single memory channel routed through the CPU pins. The 939-pin models have two memory channels, hence the higher pin count. The 940-pin CPUs also have two memory channels but they require registered memory, and most have support for SMP. Sockets F and AM2 are redesigned to support DDR2. The Socket F contains 1207 pins (Added pins speculated to be for more scalability and better power distribution). Socket AM2 has 940 pin-holes but does not support current AMD Opteron processors.
  5. ^ a b c The 478 pin socket was introduced because it uses a micro-PGA layout which is physically smaller than the socket 423. Socket 775 was introduced with support for PCI express, DDR2 memory and Intel 64 (Intel's implementation of x86-64), but also moved to the new Land Grid Array physical layout, where the pins are in the socket rather than on the CPU package, for better electrical performance.
