GeeXboX is a free Linux distribution providing a media center software suite
for personal computers. GeeXboX uses MPlayer for media playback and is
implemented as a Live CD. As such, the system does not need to be permanently
installed to a hard drive, as most modern operating systems would. Instead,
the computer can be booted with the GeeXboX CD when media playback is desired.
This is a reasonable approach for those who do not need media playback
services while performing other tasks with the same computer, for users who
wish to repurpose older computers as media centers, and for those seeking a
free alternative to Windows XP Media Center Edition. An unofficial port of
GeeXboX also runs on the Wii.

GeeXboX comes with a utility called generator, which allows the user to
customize the GeeXboX discs. The following options are configurable:

  * Include your movie(s).
  * Add non-free extra codecs.
  * Add non-free firmwares for your drivers.
  * Add extra fonts for Asian users.
  * Add extra themes.
  * Configure the network settings.
  * Configure audio related options.
  * Configure video related options.
  * Configure the remote control and receiver to be used.
  * Configure an LCD display.
  * Change theme, fonts and charset encoding.
  * Choose the services to be started with GeeXboX (like UPnP and SHOUTcast).
  * Modify MPlayer's startup options.
