Clothes-size label with EN 13402-1 pictogram and body dimensions in
centimetres (found on a high-visibility jacket sold in the United Kingdom).

EN 13402 is a European standard for labelling clothes sizes. It is based on
body dimensions, measured in centimetres. It aims to replace many older
national dress-size systems, most likely after the year 2007. Acceptance of
this form of standardization is likely to vary from country to country. For
example, the Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs has commissioned
a study [1] to categorise female body types with a view to harmonising Spanish
clothing sizes with EN-13402. Few other countries are known to have followed
suit.

## [edit] Background

There are three approaches for size-labelling of clothes:

  * body dimensions: The product label states for which range of body dimensions the product was designed. (Example: bike helmet labelled "head girth: 56â60 cm", shoe labelled "foot length: 28 cm")

  * product dimensions: The label states characteristic measures of the product. (Example: jeans labelled with their inner-leg length in centimetres or inches: i.e., not theâseveral centimetres longerâinner leg length of the intended wearer)

  * ad-hoc size: The label provides a size number or code with no obvious relationship to any measurement. (Example: Size 12, XL)

Traditionally, clothes have been labelled using many different ad-hoc size
systems. This approach has led to a number of problems:

  * Country-specific or even vendor-specific labels create additional costs.
  * Ad-hoc sizes have changed with time, often due to "vanity labelling", an inflation in body dimensions associated with a size, to avoid confronting aging customers with uncomfortable anthropometric truths.
  * Mail-order purchasing requires accurate methods for predicting the best-fitting size.
  * For many types of garments, size cannot be described adequately by just a single number, because two independent body dimensions have to match for a good fit, sometimes even three. (This is a problem in sizing jeans.)
  * Scalar ad-hoc sizes based on 1950s anthropometric studies are no longer adequate, as changes in nutrition and life styles have shifted the distribution of body dimensions.

Therefore, the European standards committee CEN/TC 248/WG 10 started in 1996
the process of designing a new modern system of labelling clothes sizes,
resulting in the standard EN 13402 "Size designation of clothes".

It is based on

  * body-dimensions
  * the metric system (SI)
  * data from new anthropometric studies of the European population performed in the late 1990s
  * similar existing international standards (ISO 3635, etc.)

## [edit] EN 13402-1: Terms, definitions and body measurement procedure

The first part of the standard defines the list of body dimensions to be used
for designating clothes sizes, together with an anatomical explanation and
measurement guidelines:

head girth

    maximum horizontal girth (circumference) of the head measured above the ears
neck girth

    girth of the neck measured with the tape measure passed 2 cm below the Adam's apple and at the level of the 7th cervical vertebra
chest girth

    maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing with the subject standing erect and the tape-measure passed over the shoulder blades (scapulae), under the armpits (axillae), and across the chest
bust girth

    maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing with the subject standing erect and the tape-measure passed horizontally, under the armpits (axillae), and across the bust prominence (preferably measured with moderate tension over a brassiere that shall not deform the breast in an unnatural way and shall not displace its volume)
underbust girth

    horizontal girth of the body measured just below the breasts
waist girth

    girth of the natural waistline between the top of the hip bones (iliac crests) and the lower ribs, measured with the subject breathing normally and standing erect with the abdomen relaxed
hip girth

    horizontal girth measured round the buttocks at the level of maximum circumference
height

    vertical distance between the crown of the head and the soles of the feet, measured with the subject standing erect without shoes and with the feet together (for infants not yet able to stand upright: length of the body measured in a straight line from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet)
inside leg length

    distance between the crotch and the soles of the feet, measured in a straight vertical line with the subject erect, feet slightly apart, and the weight of the body equally distributed on both legs
arm length

    distance, measured using the tape-measure, from the armscye/shoulder line intersection (acromion), over the elbow, to the far end of the prominent wrist bone (ulna), with the subject's right fist clenched and placed on the hip, and with the arm bent at 90Â°
hand girth

    maximum girth measured over the knuckles (metacarpals) of the open right hand, fingers together and thumb excluded
foot length

    horizontal distance between perpendiculars in contact with the end of the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel, measured with the subject standing barefoot and the weight of the body equally distributed on both feet
EN 13402-1 pictogram example

body mass

    measured with a suitable balance in kilograms
These dimensions are meant to be measured preferably without or as few as
possible clothes.

All body dimensions are measured in centimetres, except for the body mass.

The standard also defines a pictogram that can be used in language-neutral
labels to indicate one or several of the above body dimensions.

## [edit] EN 13402-2: Primary and secondary dimensions

The second part of the standard defines for each type of garment one "primary
dimension". This is the body measure according to which the product must be
labelled.

For some types of garment, a single measure may not be sufficient to select
the right product. In these cases, one or two "secondary dimensions" can be
added to the label.

The following table shows the primary and secondary dimensions listed in the
standard. Secondary dimensions are shown in parenthesis.

## [edit] EN 13402-3: Measurements and intervals

The third part of the standard defines preferred numbers of primary and
secondary body dimensions.

The product should not be labelled with the average body dimension for which
the garment was designed (i.e., not "height: 176 cm."). Instead, the label
should show the range of body dimensions from half the step size below to half
the step size above the design size (e.g., "height: 172-180 cm.").

For heights, for example, the standard recommends generally to use the
following design dimensions, with a step size of 8 cm:

Height ... 160 168 176 184 192 200 ...  
Range ... 156-164 164-172 172-180 180-188 188-196 196-204 ...  
For trousers, the recommended step size for height is 4 cm:

Height ... 156 160 164 168 172 176  
Range ... 154-158 158-162 162-166 166-170 170-174 174-178  
Height 180 184 188 192 196 200 ...  
Range 178-182 182-186 186-190 190-194 194-198 198-202 ...  
The standard defines similar tables for other dimensions and garments, only
some of which are shown here.

### [edit] Men

The standard sizes and ranges for chest and waist girth are:

Chest girth 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112  
Range 82-86 86-90 90-94 94-98 98-102 102-106 106-110 110-114  
Waist girth 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 100  
Range 70-74 74-78 78-82 82-86 86-90 90-94 94-98 98-102  
Chest girth 116 120 126 132 138 144  
Range 114-118 118-123 123-129 129-135 135-141 141-147  
Waist girth 104 108 114 120 126 132  
Range 102-106 106-111 111-117 117-123 123-129 129-135  
The above table is for drop = â12 cm, where

    drop = waist girth â chest girth.
Example: While manufacturers will typically design clothes for chest girth =
100 cm such that it fits waist girth = 88 cm, they may also want to combine
that chest girth with neighbouring waist girth step sizes 84 cm or 92 cm, to
cover these drop types (â16 cm and â8 cm) as well.

The standard also suggests that neck girth can be associated with chest girth
according to this table:

Neck girth 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44  
Range 36.5-37.5 37.5-38.5 38.5-39.5 39.5-40.5 40.5-41.5 41.5-42.5 42.5-43.5
43.5-44.5  
Chest girth 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116  
Neck girth 45 46.5 48 49.5 51  
Range 44.5-45.8 45.8-47.3 47.3-48.8 48.8-50.3 50.3-51.1  
Chest girth 120 126 132 138 144  
The standard further suggests that arm length can be associated with height
according to this table:

Height 156 160 164 168 172 176 180 184 188 192 196 200  
Arm length 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71  
Range 59-60 60-61 61-62 62-63 63-64 64-65 65-66 66-67 67-68 68-69 69-70 70-71  
### [edit] Women

#### [edit] Dress sizes

The standard sizes and ranges for bust, waist and hip girth are:

Bust girth 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 110  
Range 74-78 78-82 82-86 86-90 90-94 94-98 98-102 102-107 107-113

#### [edit] Bra sizes

    See also: Brassiere measurements
The standard sizes for brassiere are:

Underbust girth 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95  
Range 58-62 63-67 68-72 73-77 78-82 83-88 88-92 93-98  
EN 13402-1 pictogram for bra size 70B

Underbust girth 100 105 110 115 120 125  
Range 98-102 103-108 108-112 113-118 118-122 123-128  
The secondary dimension cup size can be expressed in terms of the difference

    cup size = bust girth â underbust girth
and can be labelled compactly using a letter code appended to the underbust
girth:

Code AA A B C D E F G  
Cup size range 10-12 12-14 14-16 16-18 18-20 20-22 22-24 24-26  
Example: Bra size 70B is suitable for women with underbust girth 68-72 cm and
bust girth 84-86 cm.

### [edit] Letter codes

For clothes where a larger step size is sufficient, the standard also defines
a letter code. This code represents the bust girth for women and the chest
girth for men. The standard does not define such a code for children.

Meaning Code Chest girth (men) Bust girth (women)  
extra extra small XXS 70-78 66-74  
extra small XS 78-86 74-82  
small S 86-94 82-90  
medium M 94-102 90-98  
large L 102-110 98-106  
extra large XL 110-118 107-119  
extra extra large XXL 118-129 119-131  
extra extra extra large 3XL 129-141 131-143  
Each range combines two adjacent size steps. The ranges could be extended
below XXS or above 3XL if necessary, for example:

Code Chest girth (men) Bust girth (women)  
4XL 141-154 143-155  
5XL 154-166 155-167

## [edit] EN 13402-4: Coding system

The fourth part of the standard is still under review. It will define a
compact coding system for clothes sizes. This was originally intended
primarily for industry use in databases and as a part of stock-keeping
identifiers and catalogue ordering numbers, but later users have also
expressed a desire to use compact codes for customer communication. Writing
out all the centimetre figures of all the primary and secondary measures from
EN 13402-2 can â in some cases â require up to 12 digits. The full list of
centimetre figures on the pictogram contains a lot of redundancy and the same
information can be squeezed into fewer graphemes with lookup tables. EN
13402-4 will define such tables.

An earlier draft of this part of the standard attempted to list all in-use
combinations of EN 13402-3 measures and assigned a short 2- or 3-digit code to
each.[1] Some of the industry representatives involved in the standardization
process considered this approach too restrictive. Others argued that the
primary dimension in centimetres should be a prominent part of the code.
Therefore this proposal, originally expected to be adopted in 2005, was
rejected.

Since then, several new proposals have been presented to the CEN working
group. One of these, tabled by the European Association of National
Organisations of Textile Traders (AEDT), proposes a 5-character alphanumeric
code, consisting of the 3-digit centimetre figure of the primary body
dimension, followed by one or two letters that code a secondary dimension,
somewhat like the system already defined for bra sizes.[2] For example, an
item designed for

  * bust girth: 100 cm (100)
  * hip girth: 104 cm (B)
  * height: 176 cm (G)

would bear (in addition to the explanatory pictogram) the compact size code
"100BG".[3] This proposal was agreed upon in a March 2006 meeting in Florence
and a final draft was produced by AEDT on 6 June 2006.[4]
