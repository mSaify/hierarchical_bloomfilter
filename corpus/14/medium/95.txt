For other simplified forms of English, see Simple English.

Simplified English is a controlled language originally developed for aerospace
industry maintenance manuals. It offers a carefully limited and standardized
subset of English.

Proponents claim that Simplified English can:

  * Reduce ambiguity
  * Improve comprehension for people whose first language is not English
  * Make human translation easier, faster and more cost effective
  * Facilitate computer-assisted translation and machine translation

Simplified English has a lexicon of approved words and those words can only be
used in certain ways. For example, the word close can be used to mean "shut"
(as in "Close the door"), but not "near" (as in "do not go close to the
landing gear").

## [edit] Aerospace standard

Simplified English is sometimes used as a generic term for a controlled
language. The aerospace standard is actually an industry-regulated writing
standard for aerospace maintenance documentation. It is not intended for use
as a general writing standard. The US governmentâs Plain English[1] lacks
the strict vocabulary restrictions of the aerospace standard, but it
represents an attempt at a more general writing standard.

The regulated aerospace standard has been called AECMA Simplified English,
because the European Association of Aerospace Manufacturers (AECMA) originally
created the standard in the 1980s. The AECMA standard originally came from
Fokker, which had based their standard on earlier controlled languages,
especially Caterpillar Fundamental English. In 2005, AECMA was subsumed by the
Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), which renamed
its standard to ASD Simplified Technical English or STE. STE is defined by the
specification ASD-STE100, which is maintained by the Simplified Technical
English Maintenance Group (STEMG). The standard contains a set of restrictions
on the grammar and style of procedural and descriptive text. It also contains
a dictionary of roughly 1000 approved general words. Writers are given
guidelines for adding technical names and technical verbs to their
documentation. STE is mandated by several commercial and military
specifications that control the style and content of maintenance
documentation.
