For other uses, see Time capsule (disambiguation).

A time capsule is a historic cache of goods and/or information, usually
intended as a method of communication with people in the future. Time capsules
are sometimes created and buried during celebrations such as a World Fair,
cornerstone laying for a building or other event. The phrase "time capsule"
has been in use since about 1937.

## [edit] Background

<IMG>

The Helium Centennial Time Columns Monument located in Amarillo, Texas holds 4
time capsules in stainless steel that should be opened after a duration of 25,
50, 100, and 1000 years after they were locked in 1968.[1]

Time capsules can be classified into two types: intentional and unintentional
[2]. Intentional time capsules are placed on purpose and are usually intended
to be opened at a particular future date. Unintentional time capsules are
usually archaeological in nature. Discoveries of cultural significance are
often found in standard archaeological digs as well as those from volcanic
eruptions such as Pompeii and Vesuvius.

The concept of time capsules are not recent. The Epic of Gilgamesh, among
humanity's earliest literary works, begins with instructions on how to find a
box of copper inside a foundation stone in the great walls of Uruk \- in the
box is Gilgamesh's tale, written on a lapis tablet. There were other time
capsules 5,000 years ago as vaults of artifacts hidden inside the walls of
Mesopotamian cities[2]. Egyptian and other ancient tombs are effectively time
capsules as well.

What is now thought of as a "time capsule" has more recent origins. In 1937,
during preparations for the 1939 New York World's Fair, it was suggested to
bury a "time bomb" for 5,000 years (until 6939)âthe less inflammatory name
of "time capsule" was suggested, and the name has stuck since. The 1939 New
York World's Fair time capsule was created by Westinghouse as part of their
exhibit, It was 90" long, with an interior diameter of 6.5 inches, and weighed
800 pounds. Westinghouse named the copper, chromium and silver alloy
"Cupaloy", claiming it had the same strength as mild steel. It contained
everyday items such as a spool of thread and doll, a Book of Record
(description of the capsule and its creators), a vial of staple food crop
seeds, a microscope and a 15-minute RKO Pathe Pictures newsreel. Microfilm
spools condensed the contents of a Sears Roebuck catalog, dictionary, almanac,
and other texts. This first modern time capsule was followed in 1965 by a
second capsule at the same site, but 10 feet to the north of the original.
Both capsules are buried 50 feet below Flushing Meadows Park, site of the
Fair. Both the 1939 and 1965 Westinghouse Time Capsules are meant to be opened
in 6939. More recently, in 1985, Westinghouse created a smaller, Plexiglas
shell to be buried beneath the New York Marriott Marquis hotel, in the heart
of New York's theater district. However, this time capsule was never put in
place.

The Crypt of Civilization (1936) at Oglethorpe University, scheduled to be
opened in 8113, is generally regarded to be the first successful
implementation of a modern time capsule, although it was not called a time
capsule at the time. George Edward Pendray is responsible for coining the term
"time capsule."[3][4]

During the socialist period in the USSR, many time capsules were buried with
messages to the people who would live in the future communist society.

New Zealand developed a time capsule project called "Millennium Vault" for the
turn of the 20th-century century. The project developers buried it beneath a
pyramid.[5]

Currently, four time capsules are "buried" in space. The two Pioneer Plaques
and the two Voyager Golden Records have been attached to spacecraft for the
possible benefit of spacefarers in the distant future. A fifth time capsule,
the KEO satellite, will be launched in 2009 or 2010, carrying individual
messages from Earth's inhabitants addressed to earthlings around the year
52,000, when KEO will return to Earth.

The International Time Capsule Society was created to maintain a global
database of all existing time capsules.

## [edit] Construction of a time capsule

The International Time Capsule Society provides tips for building a time
capsule.[6]  
1\. Select a retrieval date  
2\. Choose an "archivist" or director  
3\. Select a container  
4\. Find a secure indoor location, not "buried"  
5\. Secure items for time storage.  
6\. Have a solemn "sealing ceremony"  
7\. Don't forget your time capsule!  
8\. Inform the International Time Capsule Society of your completed time
capsule project.  

## [edit] Criticism

According to time capsule historian William Jarvis, most intentional time
capsules usually do not provide much useful historical information: they are
typically filled with "useless junk", new and pristine in condition, that
tells little about the people of the time[2]. Many time capsules today contain
only artifacts of limited value to future historians. Historians suggest that
items which describe the daily lives of the people who created them, such as
personal notes, pictures, and documents, would greatly increase the value of
the time capsule to future historians.

If time capsules have a museum-like goal of preserving the culture of a
particular time and place for study, they fulfill this goal very poorly in
that they, by definition, are kept sealed for a particular length of time.
Subsequent generations between the launch date and the target date will have
no direct access to the artifacts and therefore these generations are
prevented from learning from the contents directly. Therefore, time capsules
can be seen, in respect to their usefulness to historians, as poorly
implemented museums. [2]

Historians also concede that there are many preservation issues surrounding
the selection of the media to transmit this information to the future. [2]
Some of these issues include the obsolescence of technology and the
deterioration of electronic and magnetic storage media, and possible language
problems if the capsule is dug up in the distant future. Many buried time
capsules are lost, as interest in them fades and the exact location is
forgotten, or are destroyed within a few years by groundwater.A proposed deep
time capsule The Ozymandias Project addresses many of these issues.
