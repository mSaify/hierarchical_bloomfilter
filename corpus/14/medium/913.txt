This article is about the Java design model. For the arcade board, see Sega
Model 2.

In the design of Java Web applications, there are two commonly-used design
models, referred to as Model 1 and Model 2.

Model 1 is simpler and only recommended for small applications. Model 2 is
recommended for medium- and large-sized applications.

Model 2 uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate
presentation from content.

In a Model 2 application, requests from the client browser are passed to the
controller, which is a servlet. The controller decides which view (JSP) it
will pass the request to. The view then invokes methods in a JavaBean (which
may access a database) and returns the Response object to the Web container,
which is then passed on to the client browser.
