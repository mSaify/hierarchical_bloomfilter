### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

Synectics is a problem solving approach that stimulates thought processes of
which the subject is generally unaware. This method, developed by William J.
J. Gordon, has as its central principle: "Trust things that are alien, and
alienate things that are trusted." This encourages, on the one hand,
fundamental problem-analysis and, on the other hand, the alienation of the
original problem through the creation of analogies. It is thus possible for
new and surprising solutions to emerge. Synectics is more demanding of the
subject than brainstorming, as the many steps involved mean that the process
is more complicated and requires more time and effort.
