Battery size generally refers to the shape, voltage, and terminal layout of a
battery. Thus the term "size" has become interchangeable with "type".
Batteries of different types will usually not have the same dimensions and
terminal layout.

This article refers to primary and other common battery types and sizes in
household and light industrial use. A primary battery typically contains a
single chemical cell. Secondary batteries are single or multiple cells
repackaged into a single battery for use in equipment such as cameras, phones,
computers, and camcorders. An example of a secondary battery is the 2CR5 (two
lithium cells packaged as one battery) and a 4LR44 (four LR44 cells packaged
as one battery).

## [edit] Battery chemistry

Older batteries were mostly based on rechargeable lead-acid or non-
rechargeable alkaline chemistries, with nominal voltages in increments of 2.10
- 2.13 and 1.5 Volts respectively, each representing one individual
electrochemical cell.

New special battery chemistries have strained older naming conventions.
Rechargeable NiCd (Nickel Cadmium) and NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) typically
output 1.25 V per cell. Some devices may not operate properly with these
cells, given the 16% reduction in voltage, but most modern ones handle them
well. Conversely, lithium-ion rechargeable batteries output 3.7 V per cell,
23% higher than a pair of alkaline cells (3 V), which they are often designed
to replace. Non-rechargeable lithium-chemistry batteries, which provide
exceptionally high energy density, produce about 1.5 V per cell and are thus
similar to alkaline batteries.

Many new battery sizes refer to both the batteries' size and chemistry, while
older names do not. For a more complete list see battery types. This summary
is only for types relating to battery "sizes".

### [edit] Primary battery chemistries

(includes data from the energy density article)

Chemistry Cell  
Voltage Energy Density (MJ/kg) Elaboration  
Zincâcarbon 1.5 0.13 Inexpensive.  
Zinc chloride 1.5 Also known as "heavy duty", inexpensive.  
alkaline  
(zincâmanganese dioxide) 1.5 0.4-0.59 Moderate energy density.  
Good for high and low drain uses.  
oxy nickel hydroxide  
(zinc-manganese dioxide/oxy nickel hydroxide) 1.7 Moderate energy density.  
Good for high drain uses  
Lithium  
(lithiumâcopper oxide)  
LiâCuO 1.7 No longer manufactured.  
Replaced by silver oxide (IEC-type "SR") batteries.  
Lithium  
(lithiumâiron disulfide)  
LiFeS2 1.5 Expensive.  
Used in 'plus' or 'extra' batteries.  
Lithium  
(lithiumâmanganese dioxide)  
LiMnO2 3.0 0.83-1.01 Expensive.  
Only used in high-drain devices or for long shelf life due to very low rate of
self discharge.  
'Lithium' alone usually refers to this type of chemistry.  
Mercury oxide 1.35 High drain and constant voltage.  
Banned in most countries because of health concerns.  
Zincâair 1.35â1.65 1.59[1] Mostly used in hearing aids.  
Silver oxide (silver-zinc) 1.55 0.47 Very expensive.  
Only used commercially in 'button' cells.  
### [edit] Rechargeable battery chemistries

(includes data from energy density article)

Chemistry Cell  
Voltage Energy density  
(MJ/kg) Comments  
NiCd 1.2 0.14 Inexpensive.  
High/low drain, moderate energy density.  
Can withstand very high discharge rates with virtually no loss of capacity.  
Moderate rate of self discharge.  
Reputed to suffer from memory effect (which is alleged to cause early
failure).  
Environmental hazard due to Cadmium - use now virtually prohibited in Europe.  
Lead Acid 2.2 0.14 Moderately expensive.  
Moderate energy density.  
Moderate rate of self discharge.  
Higher discharge rates result in considerable loss of capacity.  
Does not suffer from memory effect.  
Environmental hazard due to Lead.  
Common use - Automobile batteries  
NiMH 1.2 0.36 Expensive (but price is falling).  
Not useable in higher drain devices.  
Traditional chemistry has high energy density, but also a high rate of self-
discharge.  
Newer chemistry has low self-discharge rate, but also a ~25% lower energy
density.  
Lithium ion 3.6 0.46 Very expensive.  
Very high energy density.  
Not usually available in "common" battery sizes (but see RCR-V3 for a counter-
example).  
Very common in laptop computers, moderate to high-end digital cameras and
camcorders, and cellphones.  
Very low rate of self discharge.  
Volatile: Chance of explosion if short circuited, allowed to overheat, or not
manufactured with rigorous quality standards.  
## [edit] Non-standard brand-specific names

Battery naming is further confused by the practice of manufacturers that
assign novel names and numbers to their batteries, disregarding common,
colloquial, IEC, and ANSI naming conventions (see LR44 battery as an example).
Often this is done to steer customers towards a specific brand, and away from
competing or generic brands, by obfuscating the common name. For example, if a
remote control needs a new battery and the battery compartment has the label,
"Replace with CX472 type battery," many customers will buy that specific
brand, not realizing that this is simply a brand name for a common type of
battery. In this article, brand-specific names have been purposely omitted to
avoid confusion.

On the other hand, with obscure battery types, the name of a specific brand
will sometimes become the most common name for that battery type, as other
manufacturers copy or modify the name so that customers recognize it.

## [edit] Table of modern primary battery sizes

The following table is a list of primary battery sizes which are currently
available in modern society. Note that there were other sizes other than those
listed in this table which are no longer available due to either a decline in
popularity or changing technological needs. Batteries for obsolete portable
vacuum tubes devices for example, are not listed. A table of older, obsolete,
and uncommon-availability batteries types and sizes can be found below this
table.

### [edit] Naming notes

  * CR# / BR# / SR# / LR# Button Cells (where the code contains 3 to 4 numeric digits): Uses an alphanumeric coding system defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in its current 60086-3 standard (Primary batteries, part 3 Watch batteries). Examples of this code are batteries coded CR2032, SR516, and LR1154 where the letters and numbers in that code indicate the battery's characteristics. The numbers in the code correlate with the cell dimensions, being the diameter in millimetres (except for the extra half millimetre in some cases) followed by the height in tenths of a millimetre. SR and LR button cells where the code contains only one or two numeric digits conform to an older international standard.

  * SR# / LR# / AG# / SG# Button Cells: IEC SR series batteries are silver oxide chemistry and provide 1.55 volts, while IEC LR series batteries are alkaline chemistry and provide 1.5 volts. Similarly, SG series batteries are the silver oxide chemistry version of the AG series where AG usually indicates alkaline chemistry. Since there are no 'common' names beyond the AG# designation, many places use these four designations interchangeably for the same sized cell, and they will all fit and work. The only difference is that silver oxide chemistry typically has 50% greater capacity than alkaline chemistry. In low-drain devices like watches (without lights) this isn't very important, but in high-drain devices like blinkies, key chain flashlights, or laser pointers silver oxide is preferred. Typically all four types will be the same price unless one buys in wholesale volume so there is no reason not to get the silver oxide version. Often the free 'demo' batteries that come with a device are the alkaline version.

  * IEC CR# / BR# Button Cells: CR denotes Manganese dioxide Lithium chemistry. Since LiMnO2 cells produce 3 volts there are no widely available alternate chemistries for a CR coin battery. Conversely one LiMnO2 cell can replace two alternate chemistry cells, in a 3, 6, 9, or 12 volt secondary battery. Though often hard to find, some CR sizes are also sold designated as BR, such as the BR2032. BR types have a slightly different chemistry (Poly-carbon monofluoride Lithium) giving a higher capacity but at the expense of maximum discharge current. They are more suited to memory retention applications.

  * Button / Coin / Watch / Micro / Miniature: In many places these are used interchangeably.
