Awareness is a term referring to the ability to perceive, to feel, or to be
conscious of events, objects or patterns, which does not necessarily imply
understanding. In biological psychology, awareness comprises a human's or an
animal's perception and cognitive reaction to a condition or event.

## [edit] Concept

Awareness is a relative concept. An animal may be partially aware, may be
subconsciously aware, or may be acutely aware of an event. Awareness may be
focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external
events by way of sensory perception. Awareness provides the raw material from
which animals develop qualia, or subjective ideas about their experience.

Also used to distinguish sensory perception is the word "awarement."
"Awarement" is the established form of awareness. Once one has accomplished
their sense of awareness they have come to terms with awarement.

## [edit] Self-awareness

Popular ideas about consciousness suggest the phenomenon describes a condition
of being aware of one's awareness or, self-awareness. Efforts to describe
consciousness in neurological terms have focused on describing networks in the
brain that develop awareness of the qualia developed by other networks.[1]

## [edit] Neuroscience

Neural systems that regulate attention serve to attenuate awareness among
complex animals whose central and peripheral nervous system provides more
information than cognitive areas of the brain can assimilate. Within an
attenuated system of awareness, a mind might be aware of much more than is
being contemplated in a focused extended consciousness.

### [edit] Basic awareness

Basic awareness of one's internal and external world depends on the brain
stem. Bjorn Merker [2], an independent neuroscientist in Segeltorp, Sweden,
argues that the brain stem supports an elementary form of conscious thought in
infants with hydranencephaly. "Higher" forms of awareness including self-
awareness require cortical contributions, but "primary consciousness" or
"basic awareness" as an ability to integrate sensations from the environment
with one's immediate goals and feelings in order to guide behavior, springs
from the brain stem which human beings share with most of the vertebrates.
Psychologist Carroll Izard emphasizes that this form of primary consciousness
consists of capacity to generate emotions and an awareness of one's
surroundings, but not an ability to talk about what one has experienced. In
the same way, people can become conscious of a feeling that they can't label
or describe, a phenomenon that's especially common in pre-verbal infants.

Due to this discovery medical definitions of brain death as a lack of cortical
activity face a serious challenge.

#### [edit] Basic interests

Down the brain stem lie interconnected regions that regulate the direction of
eye gaze and organize decisions about what to do next, such as reaching for a
piece of food or pursuing a potential mate.

## [edit] Living systems view

Outside of neuroscience biologists, Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela
contributed their Santiago theory of cognition in which they wrote:

> Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process
of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a
nervous system.[3]

This theory contributes a perspective that cognition is a process present at
organic levels that we don't usually consider to be aware. Given the possible
relationship between awareness and cognition, and consciousness, this theory
contributes an interesting perspective in the philosophical and scientific
dialogue of awareness and living systems theory.

## [edit] Communications and information systems technologies

Awareness is also a concept used in Computer Supported Cooperative Work CSCW.
Its definition has not yet reached a consensus in the scientific community.

The composed term location awareness gains momentum with the growth of
ubiquitous computing. First defined with mobile phones, the term covers a
common interest in whereabouts of remote entities, especially individuals.

## [edit] Other uses

Awareness forms a basic concept of the theory and practice of Gestalt therapy.

In general, "awareness" may also refer to public or common knowledge or
understanding about a social, scientific, or political issue, and hence many
movements try to foster "awareness" of a given subject. Examples include AIDS
awareness and Multicultural awareness.

Awareness may refer to Anesthesia awareness.
