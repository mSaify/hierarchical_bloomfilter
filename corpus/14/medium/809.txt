### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The City of Chicago is divided into seventy-seven community areas. Census data
are tied to the community areas, and they serve as the basis for a variety of
urban planning initiatives on both the local and regional levels.

The University of Chicago defined seventy-five community areas during the late
1920s, which at that time corresponded roughly to neighborhoods within the
city. In the 1950s, with the city's annexations for O'Hare airport, a seventy-
sixth community area was added. Other than the creation of the seventy-seventh
community area in 1980 (by separating #77 Edgewater from #3 Uptown),
boundaries have never been revised to reflect change but instead have been
kept relatively stable to allow comparisons of these areas over time.

Today many of the community areas no longer correspond to any single
neighborhood, and some community area names have fallen out of colloquial use.
In many cases, the actual character of the community area is quite independent
of that of the individual neighborhoods which comprise it.

Community Area designations are useful more than merely as a historical
curiosity because they are considered more durable than the names of
neighborhoods, which can change over time due to urban redevelopment,
gentrification and the constant shuffle and absorption of the immigrant
population.

### [edit] Parishes

Another method of neighborhood nomenclature in heavily Catholic neighborhoods
of Chicago has been to refer to communities in terms of parishes. For example,
one might say, "I live in St. Gertrude's, but he's from Saint Ita's." Some of
these designations have come into common parlance as developers have used them
to market new gentrifying areas such as "St. Ben's", a neighborhood found on
the Chicago Realtor Association's official Chicago Neighborhood map. Chicago's
'Polish Patches' are also named after the historically Polish church located
in the vicinity.

### [edit] Wards

Since 1923, the City of Chicago has been divided into 50 City Council
Aldermanic wards.[1] Each of the 50 areas is represented on the City council
by one Alderman and in many social, political and economic contexts, it is
reasonable to describe what part of Chicago one is from by who one's alderman
is or what ward one lives in. However, using wards as the basis for comparing
areas of the city over time has limited utility, due to the fact that the
wards need to be redistricted every ten years. The current ward boundaries are
mapped here.
