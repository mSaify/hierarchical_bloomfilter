Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov (Russian: ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¸Ð¹
ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ ÐÑÑ Ð¸Ð¿Ð¾Ð²) (1926-1999) was a Soviet naval
officer. During the Cuban Missile Crisis he prevented the launch of a nuclear
torpedo and therefore a possible nuclear war.

On October 27, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a group of eleven United
States Navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier USS Randolph trapped a
nuclear-armed Soviet Foxtrot class submarine B-59 near Cuba and started
dropping practice depth charges, explosives intended to force the submarine to
come to the surface for identification. Allegedly, the captain of the
submarine, Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky, believing that a war might already
have started, prepared to launch a retaliatory nuclear-tipped torpedo.

Three officers on board the submarine â Savitsky, Political Officer Ivan
Semonovich Maslennikov, and Second Captain Arkhipov â were authorized to
launch the torpedo if they agreed unanimously in favour of doing so. An
argument broke out among the three, in which only Arkhipov was against the
launch, eventually persuading Savitsky to surface the submarine and await
orders from Moscow. The nuclear warfare which presumably would have ensued was
thus averted.

At the conference commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Cuban Missile
Crisis held in Havana on 13 October 2002, Robert McNamara admitted that
nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. Thomas Blanton,
director of the National Security Archive, said that "a guy called Vasili
Arkhipov saved the world."

In Aleksandr Mozgovoy's 2002 book, Cuban Samba of the "Foxtrot" Quartet:
Soviet Submarines during the Year 1962 Caribbean Crisis[1], a participant of
the events, retired Commander Vadim Pavlovich Orlov, presents the events less
dramatically (the captain lost his temper, but the two other officers calmed
him down).
