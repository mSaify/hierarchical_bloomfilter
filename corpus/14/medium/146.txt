Wiktionary (a portmanteau of the words wiki and dictionary) is a multilingual,
Web-based project to create a free content dictionary, available in over 151
languages. Unlike standard dictionaries, it is written collaboratively by
volunteers, dubbed "Wiktionarians", using wiki software, allowing articles to
be changed by almost anyone with access to the website.

Like its sister project Wikipedia, Wiktionary is run by the Wikimedia
Foundation. Because Wiktionary is not limited by print space considerations,
most of Wiktionary's language editions provide definitions and translations of
words from many languages, and some editions offer additional information
typically found in thesauri and lexicons. Additionally, the English Wiktionary
includes Wikisaurus, a category that serves as a thesaurus, including lists of
slang words,[1] and the Simple English Wiktionary, compiled using the Basic
English subset of the English language.

## History and development

Wiktionary was brought online on December 12, 2002, following a proposal by
Daniel Alston.[citation needed] On March 29, 2004, the first non-English
Wiktionaries were initiated in French and Polish. Wiktionaries in numerous
other languages have since been started. Wiktionary was hosted on a temporary
URL (wiktionary.wikipedia.org) until May 1, 2004, when it switched to the
current full URL.[2] As of November 2008[update], Wiktionary features well
over 3 million entries across its 272 language editions. The largest of the
language editions is the French Wiktionary, with over 1,145,000 entries.
English Wiktionary was surpassed in early 2006 by the French Wiktionary, only
to regain the top position in September 2006. French later overtook English
again, but in August 2008, English Wiktionary overtook French again. During
September 2008, the French and English Wiktionaries traded top position twice
more. In October 2008, French overtook English. English is currently the
second largest with over 1,110,000 entries. Nine Wiktionary language editions
now contain over 100,000 entries each.

The use of bots to generate large numbers of articles is visible as "growth
spurts" in this graph of article counts at the largest eight Wiktionary
editions (data from November 2007[update]).

Despite Wiktionary's large number of entries, most of the entries and many of
the definitions at the project's largest language editions were created by
bots that found creative ways to generate entries or (rarely) automatically
imported thousands of entries from previously-published dictionaries. Seven of
the 18 bots registered at the English Wiktionary[3] created 163,000 of the
entries there.[4] Only 259 entries remain (each containing many definitions)
on Wiktionary from the original import by Websterbot from public domain
sources; the majority of those imports have been split out to thousands of
proper entries manually. Another one of these bots, "ThirdPersBot," was
responsible for the addition of a number of third-person conjugations that
would not receive their own entries in standard dictionaries; for instance, it
defined "smoulders" as the "third-person singular simple present form of
smoulder." Excluding these 163,000 entries, the English Wiktionary would have
about 137,000 entries, including terms unique to languages other than English,
making it smaller than most monolingual print dictionaries. The Oxford English
Dictionary, for instance, has 615,000 headwords, while Merriam-Webster's Third
New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged has 475,000
entries (with many additional embedded headwords). It should be noted, though,
that more detailed statistics now exist to more clearly distinguish genuine
entries from minor (small) entries.

The English Wiktionary, however does not rely on bots to the extent that
somewhat smaller editions do. The French and Vietnamese Wiktionaries, for
example, imported large sections of the Free Vietnamese Dictionary Project
(FVDP), which provides free content bilingual dictionaries to and from
Vietnamese.[5] These imported entries make up virtually all of the Vietnamese
edition's offering. Like the English edition, the French Wiktionary has
imported the approximately 20,000 entries in the Unihan database of Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean characters. The French Wiktionary grew rapidly in 2006
thanks in large part to bots copying many entries from old, freely-licensed
dictionaries, such as the eighth edition of the Dictionnaire de l'AcadÃ©mie
franÃ§aise (1935, around 35,000 words), and using bots to add words from other
Wiktionary editions with French translations. The Russian edition grew by
nearly 80,000 entries as "LXbot" added boilerplate entries (with headings, but
without definitions) for words in English and German.[6]

Most of Wiktionary currently uses a textual logo designed by Brion Vibber, a
MediaWiki developer.[7] Despite frequent discussion of modifying or replacing
the logo, a four-phase contest held at the Wikimedia Meta-Wiki from September
to October 2006[8] did not see as much participation from the Wiktionary
community as some community members had hoped. The logo that won was designed
by "Smurrayinchester". As of June 2007, seventeen of the Wiktionary editions
â French, Turkish, Vietnamese, Arabic, Italian, Swedish, Korean, Dutch,
Lithuanian, Persian, Sicilian, Ukrainian, Albanian, Simple English, Corsican,
Wolof, and Yiddish â have switched to the contest-chosen logo or variations
of it. The remaining editions use either the textual logo or, in the case of
the Galician Wiktionary, a logo that depicts a dictionary bearing the Galician
coat of arms.

## Critical reception

Critical reception of Wiktionary has been mixed. Jill Lepore wrote in the
article "Noahâs Ark" for The New Yorker, (November 6, 2006)[9]

> Thereâs no show of hands at Wiktionary. Thereâs not even an editorial
staff. "Be your own lexicographer!", might be Wiktionaryâs motto. Who needs
experts? Why pay good money for a dictionary written by lexicographers when we
can cobble one together ourselves?

> Wiktionary isnât so much republican or democratic as Maoist. And itâs
only as good as the copyright-expired books from which it pilfers. If you look
up the word "Webster" in the Wiktionary, you will be redirected to this handy
tip:

>> Noah Websterâs New International Dictionary of the English Language, 1911
(published by Merriam-Webster, Springfield, MA) is a public domain dictionary,
as is a 1913 edition, that can be used to empower Wiktionary with more
definitions.

> But, hey, at least they got his first name right.

Keir Graffâs review for Booklist was less critical:

> Is there a place for Wiktionary? Undoubtedly. The industry and enthusiasm of
its many creators are proof that thereâs a market. And itâs wonderful to
have another strong source to use when searching the odd terms that pop up in
todayâs fast-changing world and the online environment. But as with so many
Web sources (including this column), itâs best used by sophisticated users
in conjunction with more reputable sources.

References in other publications are fleeting and part of larger discussions
of Wikipedia, not progressing beyond a definition, although David Brooks in
The Nashua Telegraph described it as wild and woolly.[10] (Wooly is defined as
"confused" and "unrestrained."[11]) One of the impediments to independent
coverage of Wiktionary is the continuing confusion that it is merely an
extension of Wikipedia.[12] In 2005, PC Magazine rated Wiktionary as one of
the Internet's "Top 101 Web Sites,"[13] although little information was given
about the site.
