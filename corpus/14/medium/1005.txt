OpenSimulator, often referred to as OpenSim, is an open source server platform
for hosting virtual worlds. While it is most recognized for compatibility with
the Second Life client, it is also capable of hosting alternative worlds with
differing feature sets with multiple protocols[1]. OpenSimulator is designed
to be easily expanded through the use of plugin modules and several modified
distributions exist, such as realXtend[2], additional plugins can be found on
the OpenSimulator Forge. Multiple servers can be integrated into a 'grid'
which allows larger more complex areas to be simulated[3].

## [edit] Architecture

OpenSimulator can operate in one of two modes: standalone or grid mode. In
standalone mode, a single process handles the entire simulation. In grid mode,
various aspects of the simulation are separated among multiple processes,
which can exist on different machines. Standalone mode is simpler to
configure, but is limited to a smaller number of users. Grid mode has the
potential to scale as the number of users grows.

In grid mode, responsibilities are divided among six servers: the user server,
the grid server, the asset server, the inventory server, the messaging server,
and the region server.[4]

OpenSimulator utilizes loadable modules for most of its functionality. These
loadable modules can be independently developed to add functionality to the
server.[5]

The OpenSimulator project is hosting a collection of these loadable modules on
OpenSimulator GForge.

## [edit] Protocols

OpenSimulator uses currently Second Life protocol for client to server
communication to be compliant with Linden Lab viewer. Second Life protocol
applies both UDP and XML-RPC. Metaverse Exchange Protocol (MXP) is a second
generation client to server communication protocol proposal. Internally
OpenSimulator server components communicate with XML-RPC and REST (JSON/HTTP
and XML/HTTP).

## [edit] Community

OpenSimulator community can be reached at freenode IRC network at #opensim and
#opensim-dev channels. Community includes end users, content contributors,
region owners, grid owners, testers and developers. It is possible to join OSG
Community College classes inworld about building and script programming. The
college operates in OSGrid.

## [edit] Connecting

Connecting to OpenSim requires installation of one of the available
viewers.[6] With a browser protocol handler it is possible to launch viewer by
clicking a link in a web page.[7] After installing a viewer and a protocol
handler it is easy to connect to one of the public grids.

## [edit] Public Grids

There are several public grids available which usually require
registration.[8] Grids generally contribute to the project through testing and
community participation. These budding multiverses normally contain user
generated content and may be based around user contributed resources.
