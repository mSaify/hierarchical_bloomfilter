For man-made disasters, see list of wars and disasters by death toll.

A death toll is the number of fatalities as a result of any cause of death,
such as violence (war, mass murder, genocide, terrorist attack), an accident,
a natural disaster, extreme weather, infectious disease, etc.

Below is a list of various natural disasters by death toll. Most numbers are
estimates and are often in dispute. The incidents are ranked from the highest
to the lowest estimate given. This list is, by necessity, somewhat biased
toward the modern period, due to better reporting of events.

Some events overlap categories.

### [edit] Notes

A supervolcano eruption at Lake Toba around 74,000 years ago is thought by
some to have wiped out as much as 99% of the global human population, reducing
the population from at most 60 million to less than 10 thousand; see Toba
catastrophe theory. However, this theory is not widely accepted because the
evidence simply does not support the hypothesis: For example, there is no
conclusive evidence showing that that 99% of global human population suddenly
dropped dead anywhere near the proposed timeframe. If they did, they
apparently left no remains for us to find. In any case, that eruption is not
listed here because it occurred before recorded history, which is outside the
scope of this article. Also, the Thera eruption in the Aegean Sea between 1550
and 1650 B.C. may have caused a large number of deaths throughout the region,
from Crete to Egypt. See also La Garita Caldera, Yellowstone Caldera, and
Supervolcanoes.
