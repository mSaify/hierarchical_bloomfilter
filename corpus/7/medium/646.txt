Voter turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an
election. After increasing for many decades, there has been a trend of
decreasing voter turnout in most established democracies since the 1960s. In
general, low turnout may be due to disenchantment, indifference, or
contentment. Low turnout is often considered to be undesirable, and there is
much debate over the factors that affect turnout and how to increase it. In
spite of significant study into the issue, scholars are divided on reasons for
the decline. Its cause has been attributed to a wide array of economic,
demographic, cultural, technological, and institutional factors. There have
been many efforts to increase turnout and encourage voting.

Different countries have very different average voter turnouts. For example,
in the United States, approximately 70% of the eligible population registers
to vote, which may be an important contributing factor in the low average
election turnout, which in recent decades has averaged between 50% and 55% of
the voting age population in presidential elections. However, in 2004, the
presidential election turnout was 60.1% of the US population eligible to
vote.[1] In Australia, which has compulsory voting, and Malta, participation
reaches 95%. These differences are believed to be caused by a mix of cultural
and institutional factors.

## [edit] Reasons for voting

In any large election the chance of any one vote determining the outcome is
low; a single vote in a voting scheme such as the Electoral College in the
United States has an even lower chance of determining the outcome.[2] This
causes a difficulty for rational choice theory, in that it seems that a
rational individual should not vote. Studies using game theory, which takes
into account the ability of voters to interact, have also found that the
expected turnout for any large election should be zero.[3]

The basic formula for determining whether someone will vote is

PB \+ D > C[4]

Here, P is the probability that an individual's vote will affect the outcome
of an election, and B is the perceived benefit of that person's favored
political party or candidate being elected. D originally stood for democracy
or civic duty, but today represents any social or personal gratification an
individual gets from voting. C is the time, effort, and financial cost
involved in voting. Since P is virtually zero in most elections, PB is also
near zero, and D is thus the most important element in motivating people to
vote. For a person to vote, these factors must outweigh C.

Riker and Ordeshook developed the modern understanding of D. They listed five
major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: complying with
the social obligation to vote; affirming one's allegiance to the political
system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or
voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome);
affirming one's importance to the political system; and, for those who find
politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision.[5]
Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned
some of Riker and Ordeshook's assumptions. All of these concepts are
inherently imprecise, making it difficult to discover exactly why people
choose to vote.

Recently, several scholars have considered the possibility that B includes not
only a personal interest in the outcome, but also a concern for the welfare of
others in the society (or at least other members of one's favorite group or
party).[6][7] In particular, experiments in which subject altruism was
measured using a dictator game showed that concern for the well-being of
others is a major factor in predicting turnout[8] and political
participation.[9] Note that this motivation is distinct from D, because voters
must think others benefit from the outcome of the election, not their act of
voting in and of itself.

## [edit] The significance of voter turnout

It is often considered that high voter turnouts are desirable, though among
political scientists and economists specialising in public choice, the issue
is still debated.[10] A high turnout is generally seen as evidence of the
legitimacy of the current system. Dictators have often fabricated high
turnouts in showcase elections for this purpose. For instance, Saddam
Hussein's 2002 referendum was claimed to have had 100% participation.[11]
Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they feel are unfair or
illegitimate, or if the election is for a government that is considered
illegitimate. For example, the Holy See instructed Italian Catholics to
boycott national elections for several decades after the creation of the State
of Italy.[12] In some countries, there are threats of violence against those
who vote, such as during the 2005 Iraq elections, an example of voter
suppression. However, some political scientists question the view that high
turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N. Franklin contends
that in European Union elections opponents of the federation, and of its
legitimacy, are just as likely to vote as proponents.[13]

Assuming that low turnout is a reflection of disenchantment or indifference, a
poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the will of
the people. On the other hand, if low turnout is a reflection of contentment
of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate
as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low turnouts can
lead to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In
developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular
demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the young and the poor.
However, in India, which boasts an electorate of more than 670 million people,
the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic,
are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes[citation needed],
and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas.[14] In low-turnout
countries, these groups are often significantly under-represented in
elections. This has the potential to skew policy. For instance, a high voter
turnout among seniors coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to
more money for seniors' health care, and less for youth employment schemes.
Some nations thus have rules that render an election invalid if too few people
vote, such as Serbia, where three successive presidential elections were
rendered invalid in 2003.

In each nation, some parts of society are more likely to vote than others. In
high-turnout nations, these differences tend to be limited: as turnout
approaches 90% it becomes difficult to find differences of much significance
between voters and nonvoters, but in low turnout nations the differences
between voters and non-voters can be quite marked.[13] These differences
appear to persist over timeâthe best predictor of individual turnout is
whether or not a person voted in the previous election.[17] As a result, many
scholars think of turnout as habitual behavior that can be learned or
unlearned, especially among young adults.[18]

However, socioeconomic factors significantly affect whether or not individuals
may develop such habits. The most important socioeconomic factor in voter
turnout is education. The more educated a person is, the more likely he or she
is to vote, even when controlled for other factors such as income and class
that are closely associated with education level. Income has some effect
independently: wealthier people are more likely to vote, regardless of their
educational background. There is some debate over the effects of ethnicity,
race, and gender. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout
in many nations. Nowadays, the consensus among political scientists is that
these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and
income differences are taken into account.[19] However, since different ethnic
groups typically have different levels of education and income, there are
important differences in turnout between such groups in many societies. Other
demographic factors have an important influence: young people are far less
likely to vote than the elderly; and single people are less likely to vote
than those who are married. Occupation has little effect on turnout, with the
notable exception of higher voting rates among government employees in many
countries.[19]

There can also be regional differences in voter turnout. One issue that arises
in continent-spanning nations, such as Australia, Canada, the United States
and Russia, is that of time zones. Canada banned the broadcasting of election
results in any region where the polls have not yet closed; this ban was upheld
by the Supreme Court of Canada. In several recent Australian national
elections, the citizens of Western Australia knew which party would form the
new government up to an hour before the polling booths in their State closed.

## [edit] Hereditary factors

While socioeconomic factors are undoubtedly important for turnout, new
evidence suggests that genetic factors may also be important. Scholars
recently used twin studies of validated turnout in Los Angeles and self-
reported turnout in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to
establish that the decision to vote in the United States has very strong
heritability.[20] If so, it could help to explain why parental turnout is such
a strong predictor of voting in young people[21] â people inherit genes as
well as behaviors from their parents. It might also help to explain why voting
appears to be habitual[22] â if there is an innate predisposition to vote or
abstain, this would explain why past voting behavior is such a good predictor
of future voter reaction.

In addition to the twin study method, scholars have used gene association
studies to analyze voter turnout. Two genes that influence social behavior
have been directly associated with voter turnout, specifically those
regulating the serotonin system in the brain via the production of monoamine
oxidase and 5HTT.[23]

## [edit] Differences between elections

Within countries there can be important differences in turnout between
individual elections. Elections where control of the national executive is not
at stake generally have much lower turnoutsâoften half that for general
elections. Municipal and provincial elections, and by-elections to fill casual
vacancies, typically have lower turnouts, as do elections for the parliament
of the supranational European Union, which is separate from the executive
branch of the EU's government. In the United States, midterm congressional
elections attract far lower turnouts than Congressional elections held
concurrently with Presidential ones.[24] Runoff elections also tend to attract
lower turnouts.

In theory, one of the factors that is most likely to increase turnout is a
close race. With an intensely polarized electorate and all polls showing a
close finish between President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger John
F. Kerry, the turnout in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, was close to
60%, resulting in a record number of popular votes for both candidates;
despite losing the election, Kerry even surpassed Ronald Reagan's 1984 record
in terms of the number of popular votes received. However, this race also
demonstrates the influence that contentious social issues can have on voter
turnout; for example, the voter turnout rate in 1860 wherein anti-slavery
candidate Abraham Lincoln won the election was the second-highest on record
(81.2 percent, second only to 1876, with 81.8 percent). Nonetheless, there is
evidence to support the argument that predictable election resultsâwhere one
vote is not seen to be able to make a differenceâhave resulted in lower
turnouts, such as Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election (which featured the lowest
voter turnout in the United States since 1924), the United Kingdom general
election of 2001, and the 2005 Spanish referendum on the European
Constitution; all of these elections produced decisive results on a low
turnout.

Bad weather can reduce turnouts,[3] as can the season and the day of the week
(although many nations hold all their elections on the same weekday). Weekend
and summer elections find more of the population on holiday or uninterested in
politics, and have lower turnouts. When nations set fixed election dates,
these are usually midweek during the spring or autumn to maximize turnout.
Variations in turnout between elections tend to be insignificant. It is
extremely rare for factors such as competitiveness, weather, and time of year
to cause an increase or decrease in turnout of more than five percentage
points, far smaller than the differences between groups within society, and
far smaller than turnout differentials between nations.[25]

points lower than the general election immediately preceding it.  
Statistics from Mark N. Franklin's "Electoral Participation", found in  
Controversies in Voting Behavior (2001). Includes only "free" elections.  
Voter turnout varies considerably between countries. It tends to be lower in
the United States, Asia and Latin America than most of Europe, Canada and
Oceania. Western Europe averages a 77% turnout, the United States closer to
50%, and Latin America 54% since 1945.[26] The differences between nations
tend to be greater than those between classes, ethnic groups, or regions
within nations. Confusingly, some of the factors that cause internal
differences do not seem to apply on a global level. For instance, nations with
better-educated populaces do not have higher turnouts. Political scientists
have identified two main causes of these international differencesâculture
and institutionsâalthough this is controversial.

### [edit] Cultural factors

Wealth and literacy have some effect on turnout, but are not reliable
measures. Countries such as Angola and Ethiopia have long had high turnouts,
but so have the wealthy states of Europe. The United Nations Human Development
Index shows some correlation between higher standards of living and higher
turnout. The age of a democracy is also an important factor. Elections require
considerable involvement by the population, and it takes some time to develop
the cultural habit of voting, and the associated understanding of and
confidence in the electoral process. This factor may explain the lower
turnouts in the newer democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America. Much of
the impetus to vote comes from a sense of civic duty, which takes time and
certain social conditions to develop. G. Bingham Powell lists four major
attitudes that have a strongly positive effect on voter turnout, attitudes
that can take decades to develop:

  * trust in government;
  * degree of partisanship among the population;
  * interest in politics, and
  * belief in the efficacy of voting.[27]

Demographics also have an effect. Older people tend to vote more than youths,
so societies where the average age is somewhat higher, such as Europe; have
higher turnouts than somewhat younger countries such as the United States.
Populations that are more mobile and those that have lower marriage rates tend
to have lower turnout. In countries that are highly multicultural and
multilingual, it can be difficult for national election campaigns to engage
all sectors of the population.

The nature of elections also varies between nations. In the United States,
negative campaigning and character attacks are more common than elsewhere,
potentially suppressing turnouts. The focus placed on get out the vote efforts
and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an
important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote.
Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely
linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties.[28] Countries
where multiparty systems have developed also tend to have higher turnouts.
Nations with a party specifically geared towards the working class will tend
to have higher turnouts among that class than in countries where voters have
only big tent parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose
from.[29]

### [edit] Institutional factors

Institutional factors have a significant impact on voter turnout. Rules and
laws are also generally easier to change than attitudes, so much of the work
done on how to improve voter turnout looks at these factors. Making voting
compulsory has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout. Simply making voting
easier through greater ballot access also increases voting. Conversely, adding
barriers, such as a separate registration process, can suppress turnout. The
salience of an election, the effect that a vote will have on policy, and its
proportionality, how closely the result reflects the will of the people, are
two structural factors that also likely have important effects on turnout.

#### [edit] Voter registration

The modalities of how electoral registration is conducted can also affect
turnout. For example until "rolling registration" was introduced in the United
Kingdom, there was no possibility of the electoral register being updated
during its currency, or even amending genuine mistakes after a certain cut off
date. The register was compiled in October, and would come into force the next
February, and would remain valid until the next January. The electoral
register would become progressively more out of date during its period of
validity, as electors moved or died (also people studying or working away from
home often had difficulty voting). This meant that elections taking place
later in the year tended to have lower turnouts than those earlier in the
year. The introduction of rolling registration where the register is updated
monthly has reduced but not entirely eliminated this issue since the process
of amending the register is not automatic, and some individuals do not join
the electoral register until the annual October compilation process.

Another country with a highly efficient registration process is France. At the
age of eighteen, all youth are automatically registered. Only new residents
and citizens who have moved are responsible for bearing the costs and
inconvenience of updating their registration. Similarly, in Norway all
citizens and residents are included in the national register, Folkeregisteret,
which is simultaneously a tax list, voter registration, and membership in the
universal health system. Residents are required by law to report any change of
address to Folkeregisteret within a short time after moving.

The elimination of registration as a separate bureaucratic step can result in
higher voter turnout. This is reflected in statistics from the United States
Bureau of Census, 1982â1983. States that have same day registration, or no
registration requirements, have a higher voter turnout than the national
average. At the time of that report, the four states that allowed election day
registration were Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maine, and Oregon. Since then, Idaho
and Maine have changed to allow same day registration. North Dakota is the
only state that requires no registration.[30]

#### [edit] Compulsory voting

One of the strongest factors affecting voter turnout is whether voting is
compulsory. In Australia, voter registration and attendance at a polling booth
have been mandatory since the 1920s. These rules are strictly enforced, and
the country has one of the world's highest voter turnouts. Several other
countries have similar laws, generally with somewhat reduced levels of
enforcement. If a Bolivian voter fails to participate in an election, the
citizen may be denied withdrawal of their salary from the bank for three
months.[31]. In Mexico and Brazil, existing sanctions for non-voting are
minimal or are rarely enforced. When enforced, compulsion has a dramatic
effect on turnout. In Venezuela and the Netherlands compulsory voting has been
rescinded, resulting in substantial decreases in turnout.

#### [edit] Salience

Mark N. Franklin argues that salience, the perceived effect that an individual
vote will have on how the country is run, has a significant effect on turnout.
He presents Switzerland as an example of a nation with low salience. The
nation's administration is highly decentralized, so that the federal
government has limited powers. The government invariably consists of a
coalition of parties, and the power wielded by a party is far more closely
linked to its position relative to the coalition than to the number of votes
it received. Important decisions are placed before the population in a
referendum. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus unlikely to
have a significant effect on the nation, which probably explains the low
average turnouts in that country. By contrast Malta, with one of the world's
highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds a near monopoly on
political power. Malta has a two-party system in which a small swing in votes
can completely alter the executive.[32] On the other hand, countries with a
two party system can experience low turnout if large numbers of potential
voters perceive little real difference between the main parties. Voters'
perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience. If voters
feel that the result of an election is more likely to be determined by fraud
and corruption than by the will of the people, fewer people will vote.[33]

#### [edit] Proportionality

Another institutional factor that may have an important effect is
proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects the views of the
populace. A pure proportional representation system is fully proportional to
the votes of the populace and a voter can be sure that he will be represented
in parliament even if it is only the opposition bench; the only exception to
this rule is for voters of parties that get less than a certain required
percentage as a precondition to make it into parliament. Some countries have
such "fences" in place, e. g. Germany 5%. By contrast, a plurality system will
almost always see districts in which one party is so dominant that there is
little reason for voters of other parties to vote because votes for "losing"
parties are in a sense lost.

Proportional systems tend to produce multiparty governments (coalition
governments). This may reduce salience, since the voters have little influence
over which parties are included in the coalition.[34] For instance, after the
2005 German election, the creation of the executive not only expressed the
will of the voters of the majority party but also was the result of political
deal-making. Although there is no guarantee, this is lessened as the parties
usually state with whom they will favour a coalition after the elections.

Political scientists are divided on whether proportional representation
systems increase voter turnout (which appears to depend on a number of
contextual factors).[35] There are other systems that attempt to preserve both
salience and proportionality, for example, the Mixed member proportional
representation system in New Zealand (in operation since 1996), in Germany and
several other countries. However, these tend to be complex electoral systems,
and in some cases complexity appears to suppress voter turnout.[36] The dual
system in Germany, though, seems to have had no negative impact on voter
turnout.

#### [edit] Ease of voting

Ease of voting is a factor in rates of turnout. In the United States and most
Latin American nations, voters must go through separate voter registration
procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite
clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration
requirements have larger turnouts.[37] Other methods of improving turnout
include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and
improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting
locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or
requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some
areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible,
such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have
considered internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like
France, voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are away from work.
Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is
greatly reduced.

#### [edit] Voter fatigue

Main article: Voter fatigue

Voter fatigue can lower turnout. If there are many elections in close
succession, voter turnout will decrease as the public tires of participating.
In low-turnout Switzerland, the average voter is invited to go to the polls an
average of seven times a year; the United States has frequent elections, with
two votes per year on average, if one includes all levels of government as
well as primaries.[38] Holding multiple elections at the same time can
increase turnout; however, presenting voters with massive multipage ballots,
as occurs in some parts of the United States, can reduce turnouts.[39]

#### [edit] Voter Supression

Main article: voter suppression

In some countries voter turnout is low because citizens are prevented from
voting. Prevention could be due to legal, racial, or political reasons. In
many cases suppression is done to ensure the people in power remain in power.
In other states, supporters of candidates who are denied ballot access often
self-suppress in protest.

#### [edit] Measuring turnout

Differing methods of counting voter turnout can contribute to reported
differences between nations. In the United States, there is no accurate
registry of exactly who is eligible to vote, since only about 70â75% of
people choose to register themselves.[40] Thus, turnout has to be calculated
based on population estimates. Some political scientists have argued that
these measures do not properly account for the large number of illegal aliens,
disenfranchised felons and persons who are considered 'mentally incompetent'
in the United States, and that American voter turnout is higher than is
normally reported.[41] Scholar Michael P. McDonald constructed an estimation
of the turnout against the 'Voting Eligible Population', instead of the
'Voting Age Population'. For the American presidential elections of 2004,
turnout could then be expressed as 60.32% of VEP, rather than 55.27% of
VAP.[42]

Conversely, in New Zealand, registration is supposed to be universal, but
historically this system has been unreliable, with a large number of eligible
but unregistered citizens, creating inflated turnout figures.[43]

A second problem with turnout measurements lies in the way turnout is
computed. One can count the number of voters, or one can count the number of
ballots, and in a vote-for-one race, one can sum the number of votes for each
candidate. These are not necessarily identical because not all voters who sign
in at the polls necessarily cast ballots, although they ought to, and because
voters may cast spoil their votes. In the United States, it has been common to
report turnout as the sum of votes for the top race on the ballot, because not
all jurisdictions report the actual number of people who went to the polls nor
the number of undervotes or overvotes.[44] Overvote rates of around 0.3
percent are typical of well-run elections, but in Gadsden County Florida, the
overvote rate was 11 percent in November 2000.[45]

## [edit] Trends of decreasing turnout

<IMG>

Change in voter turnout over time for five selected countries

Over the last 40 years, voter turnout has been steadily declining in the
established democracies.[46] This trend has been most strongly felt in the
United States, and has been significant in Western Europe, Japan and Latin
America. It has been a matter of concern and controversy among political
scientists for several decades. During this same period, other forms of
political participation have also declined, such as voluntary participation in
political parties and the attendance of observers at town meetings. The
decline in voting has also accompanied a general decline in civic
participation, such as church attendance, membership in professional,
fraternal, and student societies, youth groups, and parent-teacher
associations.[47] At the same time, some forms of participation have
increased. People have become far more likely to participate in boycotts,
demonstrations, and to donate to political campaigns.[48]

Before the late 19th century, suffrage â the right to vote â was so
limited in most nations that turnout figures have little relevance to today.
One exception was the United States, which had near universal white male
suffrage by 1840. The U.S. saw a steady rise in voter turnout during the
century, reaching its peak in the years after the Civil War. Turnout declined
from the 1890s until the 1930s, then increased again until 1960 before
beginning its current long decline.[49] In Europe, voter turnouts steadily
increased from the introduction of universal suffrage before peaking in the
mid to late 1960s, with modest declines since then. These declines have been
smaller than those in the United States, and in some European countries
turnout have remained stable and even slightly increased. Globally, voter
turnout has decreased by about five percentage points over the last four
decades.[50]

### [edit] Reasons for decline

Many causes have been proposed for this decline; a combination of factors is
most likely. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they
have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies
have consistently shown that the amount of leisure time has not decreased. The
perception that one is busier is common, and might be just as important as a
real decrease in leisure time. Geographic mobility has increased over the last
few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a
recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local
candidate and local issues. The average age of first marriage has increased,
and divorce rates have skyrocketed. Single people are generally less likely to
vote. Francis Fukuyama has blamed the welfare state, arguing that the decrease
in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in
people's lives. He argues in Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of
Prosperity that the social capital essential to high voter turnouts is easily
dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those
states with the most extensive social programs tend to be the ones with the
highest turnouts.

In the United States, the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal may have caused
voters to lose faith in their political leaders during the 1960s and 1970s.
Many other nations saw a similar period of protest and alienation during this
era, in part linked to the demographic effect of the baby boom. Trust in
government and in politicians has decreased in many nations. However, the
first signs of decreasing voter turnout occurred in the early 1960s, which was
before the major upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s. Robert D. Putnam
argues that the collapse in civil engagement is due to the introduction of
television. In the 1950s and 1960s television quickly became the main leisure
activity in developed nations. It replaced earlier more social entertainments
such as bridge clubs, church groups, and bowling leagues. Putnam argues that
as people retreated within their homes and general social participation
declined so too did voting.[51] Rosenstone and Hansen contend that the decline
in turnout is the product of a change in campaigning strategies as a result of
the so-called new media. Before the introduction of television, almost all of
a party's resources would be directed towards intensive local campaigning and
get out the vote initiatives. In the modern era, these resources have been
redirected to expensive media campaigns in which the potential voter is a
passive participant.[52] During the same period, negative campaigning has
become ubiquitous in the United States and elsewhere. It has been argued that
attack ads and smear campaigns give voters a negative impression of the entire
political process. The evidence for this is mixed: elections involving highly
unpopular incumbents generally have high turnout; some studies have found that
mudslinging and character attacks reduce turnout, but that substantive attacks
on a party's record can increase it.[53]

The decline in voter turnout is almost wholly concentrated among young people.
Those who began voting prior to 1960 maintain the same high turnout rates of
that era. For each subsequent generation, starting with the one that came of
age in the 1960s, turnout has steadily declined. Recent programs to increase
the rates of voting among young peopleâsuch as MTV's "Rock the Vote" and the
"Vote or Die" initiatives in the United Statesâmay have marginally increased
turnouts of those between the ages of 18 and 25 to vote.[54] On a related
note, the 2004 American election saw young adults vote in greater numbers
since any election where 18-year-olds were eligible to vote, a statistic
Michael Moore claims may have been driven by his Slacker Uprising 2004
tour.[55] A number of governments and electoral commissions have also launched
efforts to boost turnout. For instance Elections Canada has launched mass
media campaigns to encourage voting prior to elections, as have bodies in
Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

### [edit] Ineligibility

Much of the above analysis is predicated on voter turnout as measured as a
percentage of the voting-age population. In a 2001 article in the American
Political Science Review, Michael McDonald and Samuel Popkin argued, that at
least in the United States, voter turnout since 1972 has not actually declined
when calculated for those eligible to vote, what they term the voting-eligible
population.[56] In 1972, noncitizens and ineligible felons (depending on state
law) constituted about 2% of the voting-age population. By 2004, ineligible
voters constituted nearly 10%. Ineligible voters are not evenly distributed
across the country - 20% of California's voting-age population is ineligible
to vote - which confounds comparisons of states. Furthermore, they argue that
an examination of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey shows that
turnout is low but not declining among the youth, when the high youth turnout
of 1972 (the first year 18â20 year olds were eligible to vote in most
states) is removed from the trendline.
