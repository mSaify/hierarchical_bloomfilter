Capital punishment, the death penalty or execution, is the killing of a person
by judicial process for retribution and incapacitation. Crimes that can result
in a death penalty are known as capital crimes or capital offences. The term
capital originates from Latin capitalis, literally "regarding the head" (Latin
caput). Hence, a capital crime was originally one punished by the severing of
the head.

Capital punishment has been practiced in virtually every society, excluding
those with state religious proscriptions against it. It is a matter of active
controversy in various states, and positions can vary within a single
political ideology or cultural region. A major exception is in Europe, where
Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits
the practice.[1]

Today, most countries are considered by Amnesty International as
abolitionists,[2] which allowed a vote on a resolution to the UN to promote
the abolition of the death penalty.[3] But more than 60% of the worldwide
population live in countries where executions take place in so far as the four
most populous countries in the world (such as People's Republic of China,
India, United States and Indonesia) apply the death penalty and are unlikely
to abolish it soon.

## History

Execution of criminals and political opponents has been used by nearly all
societiesâboth to punish crime and to suppress political dissent. In most
places that practice capital punishment it is reserved for murder, espionage,
treason, or as part of military justice. In some countries sexual crimes, such
as rape, adultery, incest and sodomy, carry the death penalty, as do religious
crimes such as apostasy in Islamic nations (the formal renunciation of the
State religion). In many countries that use the death penalty, drug
trafficking is also a capital offense. In China, human trafficking and serious
cases of corruption are punished by the death penalty. In militaries around
the world courts-martial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as
cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny.[4]

In 1921, banditry was dramatically punished in Afghanistan. Thieves were
imprisoned in suspended cages and left to die.

The use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history. Most
historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the
death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishment for
wrongdoing generally included compensation by the wrongdoer, corporal
punishment, shunning, banishment and execution. Within a small community,
crimes were rare and murder was almost always a crime of passion.[citation
needed] Moreover, most would hesitate to inflict death on a member of the
community.[citation needed] For this reason, execution and even banishment
were extremely rare. Usually, compensation and shunning were enough as a form
of justice.[5]

However, these were viewed as not effective responses to crimes committed by
outsiders. Consequently, even small crimes committed by outsiders were
considered to be an assault on the community and were severely
punished.[citation needed] The methods varied from beating and enslavement to
executions. However, the response to crime committed by neighbouring tribes or
communities included formal apology, compensation or blood feuds.

A blood feud or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes
fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was
common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or
organised religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of
honour. "Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective
to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that
injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished."[6] However,
in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between a war of vendetta
and one of conquest.

Severe historical penalties include breaking wheel, boiling to death, flaying,
slow slicing, disembowelment, crucifixion, impalement, crushing (including
crushing by elephant), stoning, execution by burning, dismemberment, sawing,
decapitation, scaphism, or necklacing.

Elaborations of tribal arbitration of feuds included peace settlements often
done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on
the principle of substitution which might include material (e.g. cattle,
slave) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood
debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or
transfers of property or blood money or in some case an offer of a person for
execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original
perpetrator of the crime because the system was based on tribes, not
individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the Viking
things.[7] Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more
advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (e.g. trial by
combat). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the duel.

Giovanni Battista Bugatti, executioner of the Papal States between 1796 and
1865, carried out 516 executions (Bugatti pictured offering snuff to a
condemned prisoner). Vatican City abolished its capital punishment statute in
1969.

In certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics,
monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by
common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these
nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations.
Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and
slave emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged
into a more unified system of justice which formalised the relation between
the different "classes" rather than "tribes". The earliest and most famous
example is Code of Hammurabi which set the different punishment and
compensation according to the different class/group of victims and
perpetrators. The Torah (Jewish Law), also known as the Pentateuch (the first
five books of the Christian Old Testament), lays down the death penalty for
murder, kidnapping, magic, violation of the Sabbath, blasphemy, and a wide
range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were
rare.[8] A further example comes from Ancient Greece, where the Athenian legal
system was first written down by Draco in about 621 BC: the death penalty was
applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though Solon later repealed
Draco's code and published new laws, retaining only Draco's homicide
statutes.[9] The word draconian derives from Draco's laws. The Romans also
used death penalty for a wide range of offenses.[10][11]

Islam on the whole accepts capital punishment.[12] The Abbasid Caliphs in
Baghdad, such as Al-Mu'tadid, were often cruel in their punishments.[13] In
the medieval Islamic world, there were a handful of sheikhs who were opposed
to killing as a punishment.[citation needed] In the One Thousand and One
Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, the fictional storyteller
Sheherazade is portrayed as being the "voice of sanity and mercy", with her
philosophical position being generally opposed to punishment by death. She
expresses this though several of her tales, including "The Merchant and the
Jinni", "The Fisherman and the Jinni", "The Three Apples", and "The
Hunchback".[14]

Similarly, in medieval and early modern Europe, before the development of
modern prison systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalised form
of punishment. For example, in 1700s Britain there were 222 crimes which were
punishable by death, including crimes such as cutting down a tree or stealing
an animal.[15] Thanks to the notorious Bloody Code, 18th century (and early
19th century) Britain was a hazardous place to live. For example, Michael
Hammond and his sister, Ann, whose ages were given as 7 and 11, were
reportedly hanged at King's Lynn on Wednesday, September 28, 1708 for theft.
The local press did not, however, consider the executions of two children
newsworthy.[16]

Although many are executed in China each year in the modern age, there was a
time in Tang Dynasty China when the death penalty was abolished.[17] This was
in the year 747, enacted by Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 712â756), who before
was the only person in China with the authority to sentence criminals to
execution. Even then capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only
24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.[17] Two
hundred years later there was a form of execution called Ling Chi (slow
slicing), or death by/of a thousand cuts, used in China from roughly 900 CE to
its abolition in 1905.

Despite its wide use, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century
Sephardic legal scholar, Moses Maimonides, wrote, "It is better and more
satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent
man to death." He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less
than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens
of proof, until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's
caprice." His concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw
errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.

The last several centuries have seen the emergence of modern nation-states.
Almost fundamental to the concept of nation state is the idea of citizenship.
This caused justice to be increasingly associated with equality and
universality, which in Europe saw an emergence of the concept of natural
rights. Another important aspect is that emergence of standing police forces
and permanent penitential institutions. The death penalty became an
increasingly unnecessary deterrent in prevention of minor crimes such as
theft. The argument that deterrence, rather than retribution, is the main
justification for punishment is a hallmark of the rational choice theory and
can be traced to Cesare Beccaria whose well-known treatise On Crimes and
Punishments (1764), condemned torture and the death penalty and Jeremy Bentham
who twice critiqued the death penalty.[18] Additionally, in countries like
Britain, law enforcement officials became alarmed when juries tended to acquit
non-violent felons rather than risk a conviction that could result in
execution.[citation needed] Moving executions there inside prisons and away
from public view was prompted by official recognition of the phenomenon
reported first by Beccaria in Italy and later by Charles Dickens and Karl Marx
of increased violent criminality at the times and places of executions.

The 20th century was one of the bloodiest of the human history. Massive
killing occurred as the resolution of war between nation-states. A large part
of execution was summary execution of enemy combatants. Also, modern military
organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military
discipline. In the past, cowardice, absence without leave, desertion,
insubordination, looting, shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were
often crimes punishable by death. One method of execution since firearms came
into common use has almost invariably been firing squad. Moreover, various
authoritarian statesâfor example those with fascist or communist
governmentsâemployed the death penalty as a potent means of political
oppression. Partly as a response to such excessive punishment, civil
organisations have started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of
human rights and abolition of the death penalty.

Among countries around the world, almost all European and many Pacific Area
states (including Australia, New Zealand and Timor Leste), and Canada have
abolished capital punishment. In Latin America, most states have completely
abolished the use of capital punishment, while some countries, such as Brazil,
allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason
committed during wartime. The United States (the federal government and 35 of
the states), Guatemala, most of the Caribbean and the majority of democracies
in Asia (e.g. Japan and India) and Africa (e.g. Botswana and Zambia) retain
it. South Africa, which is probably the most developed African nation, and
which has been a democracy since 1994, does not have the death penalty. This
fact is currently quite controversial in that country, due to the high levels
of violent crime, including murder and rape.[19]

Capital punishment is a contentious issue in some cultures. Supporters of
capital punishment argue that it deters crime, prevents recidivism, that it is
less expensive than life imprisonment[20] and is an appropriate form of
punishment for some crimes. Opponents of capital punishment argue that it has
led to the execution of wrongfully convicted, that it discriminates against
minorities and the poor, that it does not deter criminals more than life
imprisonment, that it encourages a "culture of violence", that it is more
expensive than life imprisonment,[20] and that it violates human rights. The
death penalty, like some other governmental actions deemed to be in the public
interest, has been particularly susceptible to the criticism that it may lead
to perverse incentives and moral hazards. From the 1970s the deterrence
hypothesis has been generally rejected by a consensus of justice policy
researchers and academics, sometimes (data resolution allowing) in favor of a
counter hypothesis of "brutalization" of public behavior.[21]

Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, Dr. Guillotin

In early New England, public executions were a very solemn and sorrowful
occasion, sometimes attended by large crowds, who also listened to a Gospel
message[22] and remarks by local preachers and politicians. The Connecticut
Courant records one such public execution on December 1, 1803, saying, "The
assembly conducted through the whole in a very orderly and solemn manner, so
much so, as to occasion an observing gentleman acquainted with other countries
as well as this, to say that such an assembly, so decent and solemn, could not
be collected anywhere but in New England."[23] Trends in most of the world
have long been to move to less painful, or more humane, executions. France
developed the guillotine for this reason in the final years of the 18th
century while Britain banned drawing and quartering in the early 19th century.
Hanging by turning the victim off a ladder or by dangling them from the back
of a moving cart, which causes death by suffocation, was replaced by "hanging"
where the subject is dropped a longer distance to dislocate the neck and sever
the spinal cord. In the U.S., the electric chair and the gas chamber were
introduced as more humane alternatives to hanging, but have been almost
entirely superseded by lethal injection, which in turn has been criticised as
being too painful. Nevertheless, some countries still employ slow hanging
methods, beheading by sword and even stoning, although the latter is rarely
employed.

### Abolitionism

The death penalty was banned in China between 747 and 759. In England, a
public statement of opposition was included in The Twelve Conclusions of the
Lollards, written in 1395. Sir Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516,
debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm
conclusion. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book
of the Italian Cesare Beccaria Dei Delitti e Delle Pene ("On Crimes and
Punishments"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate
not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of social
welfare, of torture and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, Grand Duke
Leopold II of Habsburg, famous enlightened monarch and future Emperor of
Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent Grand Duchy of
Tuscany, the first permanent abolition in modern times. On November 30, 1786,
after having de facto blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769),
Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death
penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital
execution in his land. In 2000 Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an
annual holiday on November 30 to commemorate the event. The event is
commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating Cities for
Life Day.

The Roman Republic banned capital punishment in 1849. Venezuela followed suit
and abolished the death penalty in 1863 and San Marino did so in 1865. The
last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after
legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in
1867.

In the United Kingdom, it was abolished (except for treason) in 1973, the last
execution having taken place in 1964. It was abolished totally in 1998. France
abolished it in 1981, Canada abolished it in 1976 and Australia in 1985. In
1977, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that
throughout the world, it is desirable to "progressively restrict the number of
offenses for which the death penalty might be imposed, with a view to the
desirability of abolishing this punishment".[24]

In the United States, Michigan was the first state to ban the death penalty,
on May 18, 1846.[25] Currently, as of March 18, 2009, 15 states of the U.S.
and the District of Columbia ban capital punishment, including New Mexico. [5]

The latest countries about to abolish the death penalty de facto for all
crimes were Burundi, announced on November 22, 2008[26] and South Korea in
practice on December 31, 2007 after ten years of disuse. The latest to abolish
executions de jure was Argentina.

Since World War II there has been a consistent trend towards abolishing the
death penalty. In 1977, 16 countries were abolitionist. As of February 1,
2009, 92 countries had abolished capital punishment, 10 had done so for all
offences except under special circumstances, and 36 had not used it for at
least 10 years or under a moratorium. Fifty-nine actively retained the death
penalty.[27]

At least 3,000 people (and probably considerably more) were sentenced to death
during 2007, and at the end of the year around 25,000 were on death row, with
Pakistan and the USA accounting for about half this figure. China carries out
by far the greatest number of executions: Amnesty International has confirmed
at least 470 during 2007, but the true figure has been estimated at up to
6,000. Outside China, at least 800 people were put to death in 23 countries
during 2007, with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq and the USA the main
contributors. Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen executed people for crimes
committed when they were juveniles, in contravention of international law.[28]

Executions are known to have been carried out in the following countries in
2007:[28]

    Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Botswana, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, USA, Vietnam, Yemen.
In 2007 the largest number of verifiable executions were carried out in the
six countries listed below (with the exception of the US, the figures are
believed to be under-estimates):

1.Based on a combination of published and anecdotal evidence, Dui Hua
foundation suggests the real tally in China may be as high as 5,000 (3.78 per
million people)[29]  
In 2008 the worldwide execution rate was 2,390, with China responsible for
executing approximately 1,740, Iran 342, Saudia Arabia 102, Pakistan 36, the
United States 37, and Japan 15.[30]

The use of the death penalty is becoming increasingly restrained in
retentionist countries. Singapore, Japan and the U.S. are the only fully
developed countries that have retained the death penalty. The death penalty
was overwhelmingly practiced in poor and authoritarian states, which often
employed the death penalty as a tool of political oppression. During the
1980s, the democratisation of Latin America swelled the rank of abolitionist
countries. This was soon followed by the fall of communism in Central and
Eastern Europe, which then aspired to enter the EU. In these countries, the
public support for the death penalty varies but it is decreasing.[31] The
European Union and the Council of Europe both strictly require member states
not to practice the death penalty (see Capital punishment in Europe). On the
other hand, rapid industrialisation in Asia has been increasing the number of
developed retentionist countries. In these countries, the death penalty enjoys
strong public support, and the matter receives little attention from the
government or the media. This trend has been followed by some African and
Middle Eastern countries where support for the death penalty is high.

Some countries have resumed practicing the death penalty after having
suspended executions for long periods. The United States suspended executions
in 1972 but resumed them in 1977; there was no execution in India between 1995
and 2004; and Sri Lanka recently declared an end to its moratorium on the
death penalty, although it has not yet performed any executions. The
Philippines re-introduced the death penalty in 1993 after abolishing it in
1987, but abolished it again in 2006.

### Execution for drug-related offenses

Several countries around the world execute offenders for drug-related crimes.
Human rights activists have heavily criticised this.[32] Following the
execution of an Australian in Singapore for drug smuggling, Australian prime
minister John Howard stated that "the punishment certainly did not fit the
crime".

The following is a list of countries with statutory provisions for the death
penalty for drug-related offenses.

### Juvenile offenders

The death penalty for juvenile offenders (criminals aged under 18 years at the
time of their crime) has become increasingly rare. Since 1990, nine countries
have executed offenders who were juveniles at the time of their crimes: China,
D.R. Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United States
and Yemen.[33] China, Pakistan, the United States and Yemen have since raised
the minimum age to 18.[34] Amnesty International has recorded 61 verified
executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who
had been convicted of committing their offenses as juveniles.[35] China does
not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have
reportedly taken place.[36] The United States Supreme Court abolished capital
punishment for offenders under the age of 16 in Thompson v. Oklahoma (1988),
and for all juveniles in Roper v. Simmons (2005). Between 2005 and May 2008,
Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen were reported to have executed
child offenders, the most being from Iran.[37]

Starting in 1642 within British America, an estimated 365[38] juvenile
offenders were executed by the states and federal government of the United
States.[39] In 2002, the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitutional
the execution of individuals with mental retardation.[40]

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which forbids
capital punishment for juveniles under article 37(a), has been signed by all
countries and ratified, except for Somalia and the United States.[41] The UN
Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that
the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of
customary international law. A majority of countries are also party to the
U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (whereas under
Article 6.5 also states that "Sentence of death shall not be imposed for
crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age...").

In Japan, the minimum age for the death penalty are 18 as mandated by the
internationals standars. But under Japanese law, anyone under 20 is considered
a juvenile. There are three men currently on death row for crimes they
committed at age 18 or 19.

#### Iran and child executions

Iran, despite its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is currently the
world's biggest executioner of child offenders, for which it has received
international condemnation; the country's record is the focus of the Stop
Child Executions Campaign.

Iran accounts for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and
currently has roughly 140 people on death row for crimes committed as
juveniles (up from 71 in 2007).[42][43] The recent executions of Mahmoud
Asgari, Ayaz Marhoni and Makwan Moloudzadeh became international symbols of
Iran's child capital punishment and the flawed Iranian judicial system that
hands down such sentences.[44][45]

#### Somalia

There is evidence that child executions are taking place in the parts of
Somalia controlled by the Islamic Courts Union. In October, 2008, a girl,
Aisho Ibrahim Dhuhulow was buried up to her neck at a football stadium, then
stoned to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after
she had allegedly pleaded guilty to adultery in a shari`ah court in Kismayo, a
city controlled by Islamist insurgents. According to the insurgents she had
stated that she wanted shari`ah law to apply.[46]

However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, that she begged
for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her
neck in the ground.[47] Amnesty International later learned that the girl was
in fact 13 years old (i.e. a child) and had been arrested by the al-Shabab
militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.[48]

### Methods

Main article: List of methods of capital punishment

Methods of execution include electrocution, the firing squad or other sorts of
shooting, stoning in Islamic countries, the gas chamber, hanging, and lethal
injection.

## Controversy and debate

Main article: Capital punishment debate

Capital punishment is often the subject of controversy. Opponents of the death
penalty argue that it has led to the execution of innocent people, that life
imprisonment is an effective and less expensive substitute,[20] that it
discriminates against minorities and the poor, and that it violates the
criminal's right to life. Supporters believe that the penalty is justified for
murderers by the principle of retribution, that life imprisonment is not an
equally effective deterrent, and that the death penalty affirms the right to
life by punishing those who violate it in the strictest form.

### Wrongful executions

Main article: Wrongful execution

"Wrongful execution" is a miscarriage of justice occurring when an innocent
person is put to death by capital punishment.[49] Many people have been
proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.[50][51][52] Some have
claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the U.S. in
face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt. Newly-
available DNA evidence has allowed the exoneration of more than 15 death row
inmates since 1992 in the U.S.,[53] but DNA evidence is only available in a
fraction of capital cases. In the UK, reviews prompted by the Criminal Cases
Review Commission have resulted in one pardon and three exonerations with
compensation paid for people executed between 1950 and 1953, when the
execution rate in England and Wales averaged 17 per year.

### Public opinion

Support for the death penalty varies. Both in abolitionist and retentionist
democracies, the government's stance often has wide public support and
receives little attention by politicians or the media. In some abolitionist
countries, the majority of the public supports or has supported the death
penalty. Abolition was often adopted due to political change, as when
countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an
entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable
exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades (the
earliest is Michigan, where it was abolished in 1847), while others actively
use it today. The death penalty there remains a contentious issue which is
hotly debated. Elsewhere, however, it is rare for the death penalty to be
abolished as a result of an active public discussion of its merits.

Execution with a Garrote

In abolitionist countries, debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal
murders, though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it.
However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist
attacks, has prompted some countries (such as Sri Lanka and Jamaica) to
effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. In retentionist
countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has
occurred, though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the
judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty.

A Gallup International poll from 2000 said that "Worldwide support was
expressed in favor of the death penalty, with just more than half (52%)
indicating that they were in favour of this form of punishment." A number of
other polls and studies have been done in recent years with various results

In a poll completed by Gallup in October 2008, 64% of Americans supported the
death penalty for persons convicted of murder, while 30% were against and 5%
did not have an opinion.[54]

In the U.S., surveys have long shown a majority in favor of capital
punishment. An ABC News survey in July 2006 found 65 percent in favour of
capital punishment, consistent with other polling since 2000.[55] About half
the American public says the death penalty is not imposed frequently enough
and 60 percent believe it is applied fairly, according to a Gallup poll from
May 2006.[56] Yet surveys also show the public is more divided when asked to
choose between the death penalty and life without parole, or when dealing with
juvenile offenders.[57] Roughly six in 10 tell Gallup they do not believe
capital punishment deters murder and majorities believe at least one innocent
person has been executed in the past five years.[58]

### International organisations

The United Nations introduced a resolution during the General Assembly's 62nd
sessions in 2007 calling for a universal ban.[59][60] The approval of a draft
resolution by the Assemblyâs third committee, which deals with human rights
issues, voted 99 to 52, with 33 abstentions, in favour of the resolution on
November 15, 2007 and was put to a vote in the Assembly on December
18.[61][62][63] Again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions
adopted a second resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death
penalty in the UN General Assembly (Third Committee) on November 20. 105
countries voted in favour of the draft resolution, 48 voted against and 31
abstained. A range of amendments proposed by a small minority of pro-death
penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated. It had in 2007 passed a non-
binding resolution (by 104 to 54, with 29 abstentions) by asking its member
states for "a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death
penalty".[64]

Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms
the prohibition on capital punishment in the EU

A number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the
Sixth Protocol (abolition in time of peace) and the Thirteenth Protocol
(abolition in all circumstances) to the European Convention on Human Rights.
The same is also stated under the Second Protocol in the American Convention
on Human Rights, which, however has not been ratified by all countries in the
Americas, most notably Canada and the United States. Most relevant operative
international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious
crime, most notably, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
This instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol
prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.[65]

Several international organisations have made the abolition of the death
penalty (during time of peace) a requirement of membership, most notably the
European Union (EU) and the Council of Europe. The EU and the Council of
Europe are willing to accept a moratorium as an interim measure. Thus, while
Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and practices the death penalty
in law, it has not made public use of it since becoming a member of the
Council. Other states, while having abolished de jure the death penalty in
time of peace and de facto in all circumstances, have not ratified Protocol
no.13 yet and therefore have no international obligation to refrain from using
the death penalty in time of war or imminent threat of war (Armenia, Italy,
Latvia, Poland and Spain[66]). France is the most recent to ratify it, on
October 10, 2007, with an effective date of February 1, 2008.[67][68]

Turkey has recently, as a move towards EU membership, undergone a reform of
its legal system. Previously there was a de facto moratorium on death penalty
in Turkey as the last execution took place in 1984. The death penalty was
removed from peacetime law in August 2002, and in May 2004 Turkey amended its
constitution in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. It
ratified Protocol no. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights in
February 2006. As a result, Europe is a continent free of the death penalty in
practice, all states but Russia, which has entered a moratorium, having
ratified the Sixth Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, with
the sole exception of Belarus, which is not a member of the Council of Europe.
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has been lobbying for
Council of Europe observer states who practice the death penalty, the U.S. and
Japan, to abolish it or lose their observer status. In addition to banning
capital punishment for EU member states, the EU has also banned detainee
transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death
penalty.[citation needed]

Among non-governmental organisations (NGOs), Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch are noted for their opposition to capital punishment. A number of
such NGOs, as well as trade unions, local councils and bar associations formed
a World Coalition Against the Death Penalty in 2002.

## Religious views

Main article: Religion and capital punishment

### Buddhism

There is disagreement among Buddhists as to whether or not Buddhism forbids
the death penalty. The first of the Five Precepts (Panca-sila) is to abstain
from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the Dhammapada states:

    Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill. Everyone fears punishment; everyone loves life, as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill.
Chapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states, "Him I call a brahmin
who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He
neither kills nor helps others to kill." These sentences are interpreted by
many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting
any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, as is often
the case with the interpretation of scripture, there is dispute on this
matter. Historically, most states where the official religion is Buddhism have
imposed capital punishment for some offenses. One notable exception is the
abolition of the death penalty by the Emperor Saga of Japan in 818. This
lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions continued to be
conducted as a form of retaliation. Japan still imposes the death penalty,
although some recent justice ministers have refused to sign death warrants,
citing their Buddhist beliefs as their reason.[69] Other Buddhist-majority
states vary in their policy. For example, Bhutan has abolished the death
penalty, but Thailand still retains it, although Buddhism is the official
religion in both.

### Judaism

The official teachings of Judaism approve the death penalty in principle but
the standard of proof required for application of death penalty is extremely
stringent, and in practice, it has been abolished by various Talmudic
decisions, making the situations in which a death sentence could be passed
effectively impossible and hypothetical. "Forty years before the destruction"
of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD, i.e. in 30 AD, the Sanhedrin effectively
abolished capital punishment, making it a hypothetical upper limit on the
severity of punishment, fitting in finality for God alone to use, not fallible
people.[70]

In law schools everywhere, students read the famous quotation from the 12th
century legal scholar, Maimonides,

    "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."
Maimonides argued that executing a defendant on anything less than absolute
certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until
we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice." Maimonides
was concerned about the need for the law to guard itself in public
perceptions, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect.[71]

### Islam

Scholars of Islam hold it to be permissible but the victim or the family of
the victim has the right to pardon. In Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), to forbid
what is not forbidden is forbidden. Consequently, it is impossible to make a
case for abolition of the death penalty, which is explicitly endorsed.

Sharia Law or Islamic law may require capital punishment, there is great
variation within Islamic nations as to actual capital punishment. Apostasy in
Islam and stoning to death in Islam are controversial topics. Furthermore, as
expressed in the Qur'an, capital punishment is condoned. Although the Qur'an
prescribes the death penalty for several hadd (fixed) crimesâincluding
rapeâmurder is not among them. Instead, murder is treated as a civil crime
and is covered by the law of qisas (retaliation), whereby the relatives of the
victim decide whether the offender is punished with death by the authorities
or made to pay diyah (wergild) as compensation.[72]

"If anyone kills person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in
the land - it would be as if he killed all people. And if anyone saves a life,
it would be as if he saved the life of all people" (Qur'an 5:32). "Spreading
mischief in the land" can mean many different things, but is generally
interpreted to mean those crimes that affect the community as a whole, and
destabilise the society. Crimes that have fallen under this description have
included: (1) Treason, when one helps an enemy of the Muslim community; (2)
Apostasy, when one leaves the faith; (3) Land, sea, or air piracy; (4) Rape;
(5) Adultery; (6) Homosexual behaviour.[73]

### Christianity

Although some interpret that Jesus' teachings condemn the death penalty in The
Gospel of Luke and The Gospel of Matthew regarding Turning the other cheek,
and John 8:7 in which Jesus intervenes in the stoning of an adulteress,
rebuking the mob with the phrase "may he who is without sin cast the first
stone", others consider Romans 13:3-4 to support it. Also, Leviticus 20:2-27
has a whole list of situations in which execution is supported. Christian
positions on this vary.[74] The sixth commandment (fifth in the Roman Catholic
and Lutheran churches) is preached as 'Thou shalt not kill' by some
denominations and as 'Thou shalt not murder' by others. As some denominations
do not have a hard-line stance on the subject, Christians of such
denominations are free to make a personal decision.[75]

#### Roman Catholic Church

In a June, 2004 memo to the U.S. Bishops, Pope Benedict XVI (then known as
Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger) made this statement : "Not all moral issues have
the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia. There may be a legitimate
diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the
death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia." [76]

The Church has traditionally accepted capital punishment as per the theology
of Thomas Aquinas (who accepted the death penalty as a necessary deterrent and
prevention method, but not as a means of vengeance; see also Aquinas on the
death penalty).

In Evangelium Vitae, the Church teaches that capital punishment should be
avoided unless it is the only way to defend society from the offender in
question, and that with today's penal system such a situation requiring an
execution is either rare or non-existent.[77] The Catechism of the Catholic
Church holds a similar view [78]

#### Anglican and Episcopalian

The Lambeth Conference of Anglican and Episcopalian bishops condemned the
death penalty in 1988:

> This Conference: ... 3. Urges the Church to speak out against: ... (b) all
governments who practice capital punishment, and encourages them to find
alternative ways of sentencing offenders so that the divine dignity of every
human being is respected and yet justice is pursued;....[79]

#### United Methodist Church

The United Methodist Church, along with other Methodist churches, also
condemns capital punishment, saying that it cannot accept retribution or
social vengeance as a reason for taking human life.[80] The Church also holds
that the death penalty falls unfairly and unequally upon marginalised persons
including the poor, the uneducated, ethnic and religious minorities, and
persons with mental and emotional illnesses.[81] The General Conference of the
United Methodist Church calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to capital
punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying
out the death penalty sentence.

#### The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America

In a 1991 social policy statement, the ELCA officially took a stand to oppose
the death penalty. It states that revenge is a primary motivation for capital
punishment policy and that true healing can only take place through repentance
and forgiveness.[82]

#### The Southern Baptist Convention

In 2000 the Southern Baptist Convention updated Baptist Faith and Message. In
it the convention officially sanctioned the use of capital punishment by the
State. It said that it is the duty of the state to execute those guilty of
murder and that God established capital punishment in the Noahic Covenant.

#### Other Protestants

Several key leaders early in the Protestant Reformation, including Martin
Luther and John Calvin, followed the traditional reasoning in favour of
capital punishment, and the Lutheran Church's Augsburg Confession explicitly
defended it. Some Protestant groups have cited Genesis 9:5â6, Romans
13:3â4, and Leviticus 20:1â27 as the basis for permitting the death
penalty.[83]

Mennonites, Church of the Brethren and Friends have opposed the death penalty
since their founding, and continue to be strongly opposed to it today. These
groups, along with other Christians opposed to capital punishment, have cited
Christ's Sermon on the Mount (transcribed in Matthew Chapter 5â7) and Sermon
on the Plain (transcribed in Luke 6:17â49). In both sermons, Christ tells
his followers to turn the other cheek and to love their enemies, which these
groups believe mandates nonviolence, including opposition to the death
penalty.

#### Eastern Orthodox Christianity

Eastern Orthodox Christianity is against the death penalty, believing that
killing is wrong in any circumstance.[citation needed]

#### Esoteric Christianity

The Rosicrucian Fellowship and many other Christian esoteric schools condemn
capital punishment in all circumstances.[84][85]

## In arts and media

### Literature

  * The Gospels describe the execution of Jesus Christ at length, and these accounts form the central story of the Christian faith. Depictions of the crucifixion are abundant in Christian art.
  * Valerius Maximus' story of Damon and Pythias was long a famous example of fidelity. Damon was sentenced to death (the reader does not learn why) and his friend Pythias offered to take his place.
  * "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" is a short story by Ambrose Bierce originally published in 1890. The story deals with the hanging of a Confederate sympathiser during the American Civil War.
  * Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities ends in the climactic execution of the book's main character.
  * Victor Hugo's The Last Day of a Condemned Man (Le Dernier Jour d'un condamnÃ©) describes the thoughts of a condemned man just before his execution; also notable is its preface, in which Hugo argues at length against capital punishment.
  * AnaÃ¯s Nin's anthology Little Birds included an erotic depiction of a public execution.
  * William Burroughs' novel Naked Lunch also included erotic and surreal depictions of capital punishment. In the obscenity trial against Burroughs, the defense claimed successfully that the novel was a form of anti-death-penalty argument, and therefore had redeeming political value.
  * In The Chamber by John Grisham, a young lawyer tries to save his Klansman grandfather from being executed. The novel is noted for presentation of anti-death penalty materials.
  * Bernard Cornwell's novel Gallows Thief is a whodunit taking place in early 19th century England, during the so-called "Bloody Code" a series of laws making several minor crimes capital offenses. The hero is a detective assigned to investigate the guilt of a condemned man, and the difficulties he encounters act as a harsh indictment of the draconian laws and the public's complacent attitude towards capital punishment.
  * A Hanging, by George Orwell, tells the story of an execution that he witnessed while he served as a policeman in Burma in the 1920s. He wrote, "It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive..."
  * Discipline and Punish: The Birth of The Prison, by Michel Foucault deals with capital punishment relative to how torture has been eradicated for the most part, and punishment is now quick and painless. Foucault believes that punishment is now directed more toward the soul than toward the body.
  * A Lesson Before Dying follows a wrongly convicted man on death row

### Film, television, and theatre

  * Capital punishment has been the basis of many motion pictures, including Seed, Dead Man Walking based on the book by Sister Helen Prejean, The Green Mile, The Life of David Gale and Dancer in the Dark.
  * The stage play (and later film) The Exonerated by Erik Jensen and Jessica Blank
  * The HBO series Oz focused on counter-perspectives for/against the death penalty.
  * Prison Break is a 2005 television series, whose protagonist attempts to save his brother from execution by devising a plan that will help them escape from prison.
  * The Film Let Him Have It Is the True Story of a Young Understood Male, who after being controversially accused, is executed by hanging.

### Music

  * "16 on Death Row", a song from 2Pac's Posthumous Album R U Still Down? (Remember Me)

  * "25 Minutes to Go" is a song written by Shel Silverstein and sung by Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison and The Brothers Four.
  * "The Mercy Seat" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (also performed by Johnny Cash) describes a man being executed via the electric chair who maintains his innocence until he is about to die, when he admits to his guilt.
  * "Ride The Lightning" by Metallica is also about a man being executed via an electric chair, although he is not ultimately culpable, as through insanity or loss of autonomy.
  * "Hallowed Be Thy Name" by Iron Maiden is about a man about be executed by hanging.
  * In "Green Green Grass of Home", the singer who is apparently returning home is actually awaiting his execution.
  * "Shock rock" star Alice Cooper will use three different methods of capital punishment for his stage shows. The three are the guillotine, the electric chair (retired) and hanging (first method, then retired, then used on the 2007 tour).
  * Freedom Cry is an album of songs performed by condemned prisoners in Uganda, recorded by prisoners' rights charity African Prisons Project and available online.[86]
  * "Gallows Pole" is a centuries old folk song, popularised by Lead Belly, which has seen several cover versions. Led Zeppelin covered the song in the 70's, and was subsequently revived by Page and Plant during their No Quarter acoustic tours.
  * The Bee Gees song "I've Gotta Get a Message to You" deals with a man who is about to be executed who wants to get one last message to his wife.
  * The song "The Man I Killed" by NOFX from their album Wolves in Wolves' Clothing is sung from the perspective of a death row inmate during his execution by lethal injection.
  * Ellis Unit One - Steve Earle (from the movie, Dead Man Walking) is a movie that looks at capital punishment from the perspective of the jail guards.
