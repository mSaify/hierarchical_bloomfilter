Robert Michael Gates (born September 25, 1943) is currently serving as the
22nd United States Secretary of Defense. He took office on December 18,
2006.[2] Prior to this, Gates served for 26 years in the Central Intelligence
Agency and the National Security Council, and under President George H. W.
Bush as Director of Central Intelligence. Before he joined the CIA, he served
with the United States Air Force (USAF).[3] After leaving the CIA, Gates
became president of Texas A&M University and was a member of several corporate
boards. Gates also served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan
commission co-chaired by James A. Baker III and Lee Hamilton, that has studied
the Iraq War. He was also the first pick to serve as Secretary of the
Department of Homeland Security when it was created following the September
11, 2001 attacks, but he declined the appointment in order to remain President
of Texas A&M University.[4]

Gates accepted the nomination as Secretary of Defense position on November 8,
2006, replacing Donald Rumsfeld. He was confirmed with bipartisan support.[5]
In a 2007 profile written by former National Security Adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski, Time named Gates one of the year's most influential people.[5] In
2008, Gates was named one of America's Best Leaders by U.S. News & World
Report.[6] He currently continues to serve as Secretary of Defense in
President Barack Obama's cabinet.[7]

## [edit] Early life and education

A native of Wichita, Kansas, Gates attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy
Scouts of America (BSA) and received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from
the BSA as an adult.[8][9] He graduated from Wichita East High School in 1961,
reportedly with straight "A"s.[10]

Gates then received a scholarship to attend the College of William and Mary.
There, he graduated in 1965 with a B.A. in History. At William & Mary, Gates
was an active member and president of the Alpha Phi Omega (the national
service fraternity) Chapter and the Young Republicans; he was also the
business manager for the William and Mary Review, a literary and art
magazine.[11] At his William & Mary graduation ceremony, Gates received the
Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award naming him the graduate that "has made the
greatest contribution to his fellow man." [11]

Gates then pursued a Master's degree in History from Indiana University in
1966. Finally, he completed his doctorate in Russian and Soviet history from
Georgetown University in 1974. The title of his Georgetown doctoral
dissertation is "Soviet sinology: an untapped source for Kremlin views and
disputes relating to contemporary events in China" and is available from
University Microfilms International as document number 7421652. He received an
L.H.D. (Doctor of Humane Letters) from William & Mary in 1998.

He married on January 7, 1967.[12]

## [edit] Intelligence career

### [edit] Positions

While at Indiana University, Gates was recruited by the Central Intelligence
Agency and joined the agency in 1966.[13] On 4 January 1967, he was
conscripted and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air
Force.[12][13] From 1967 to 1969, he was assigned to the Strategic Air Command
as an intelligence officer which included a stint at Whiteman Air Force Base
in Missouri, where he delivered intelligence briefings to Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile crews.[14] After fulfilling his military obligation, he
rejoined the CIA.

Gates left the CIA in 1974 to serve on the staff of the National Security
Council. He returned to the CIA in late 1979, serving briefly as the director
of the Strategic Evaluation Center, Office of Strategic Research. He was named
the Director of the DCI/DDCI Executive Staff in 1981, Deputy Director for
Intelligence in 1982, and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence from April
18, 1986 to March 20, 1989.

### [edit] Director of Central Intelligence

Gates while Director of Central Intelligence.

Gates was nominated to become the Director of Central Intelligence (head of
the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate
would reject the nomination due to controversy about his role in the Iran-
Contra affair.

Gates was Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from
March until August 1989, and was Assistant to the President and Deputy
National Security Adviser from August 1989 until November 1991.

Gates was nominated (for the second time) for the position of Director of
Central Intelligence by President George H. W. Bush on May 14, 1991, confirmed
by the Senate on November 5, and sworn in on November 6, becoming the only
career officer in the CIA's history (as of 2005) to rise from entry-level
employee to Director.

Deputy Directors during his tenure were Richard J. Kerr (from November 6, 1991
until March 2, 1992) and Adm. William O. Studeman (from April 9, 1992 through
the remainder of Dr. Gates' tenure). He served until 1993.

The final report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters, issued on
August 4, 1993, said that Gates "was close to many figures who played
significant roles in the Iran/contra affair and was in a position to have
known of their activities. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did
not warrant indictment..."[15]

### [edit] Level of involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal

Because of his senior status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who
played significant roles in the Iran-Contra Affair and was in a position to
have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates
advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that
the U.S. do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the
country to remove the Sandinista government.[16] The evidence developed by
Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment of Gates for his Iran-Contra
activities or his responses to official inquiries.

Gates was an early subject of Independent Counsel's investigation, but the
investigation of Gates intensified in the spring of 1991 as part of a larger
inquiry into the Iran/contra activities of CIA officials. This investigation
received an additional impetus in May 1991, when President George H.W. Bush
nominated Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The chairman and
vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) requested,
in a letter to the Independent Counsel on May 15, 1991, any information that
would âsignificantly bear on the fitnessâ of Gates for the CIA post.

Gates consistently testified that he first heard on October 1, 1986, from
Charles E. Allen, the national intelligence officer who was closest to the
Iran initiative, that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted
to support the Contras. Other evidence proves, however, that Gates received a
report on the diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr.[17]
The issue was whether the Independent Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that Gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed
not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with
Allen in October.

Grand Jury secrecy rules hampered Independent Counsel's response.
Nevertheless, in order to answer questions about Gates' prior testimony,
Independent Counsel accelerated his investigation of Gates in the summer of
1991. This investigation was substantially completed by September 3, 1991, at
which time Independent Counsel determined that Gates' Iran-Contra activities
and testimony did not warrant prosecution.

Independent Counsel made this decision subject to developments that could have
warranted reopening his inquiry, including testimony by Clair E. George, the
CIA's former deputy director for operations. At the time Independent Counsel
reached this decision, the possibility remained that George could have
provided information warranting reconsideration of Gates's status in the
investigation. George refused to cooperate with Independent Counsel and was
indicted on September 19, 1991. George subpoenaed Gates to testify as a
defense witness at George's first trial in the summer of 1994, but Gates was
never called.

## [edit] Career after leaving the CIA

### [edit] 1993-1999

After retiring from the CIA in 1993, Gates worked as an academic and lecturer.
He evaluated student theses for the International Studies Program of the
University of Washington.[citation needed] He lectured at Harvard, Yale, Johns
Hopkins, Vanderbilt, Georgetown, Indiana, Louisiana State, Oklahoma, and the
College of William and Mary.[citation needed] Gates served as a member of the
Board of Visitors of the University of Oklahoma International Programs Center
and a trustee of the endowment fund for the College of William and Mary, his
alma mater, which in 1998 conferred upon him honorary degree of Doctor of
Humane Letters.

In 1996, Gates' autobiography, From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story
of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War, was published. Gates has
also written numerous articles on government and foreign policy and has been a
frequent contributor to the op-ed page of The New York Times.[18]

Gates at Texas A&M

### [edit] Texas A&M

Gates was the interim Dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public
Service at Texas A&M University from 1999 to 2001. On August 1, 2002, he
became the 22nd President of Texas A&M. As the university president, Gates
made significant progress in four key areas of the university's "Vision 2020"
plan, a plan to become one of the top 10 public universities by the year 2020.
The four key areas include improving student diversity, increasing the size of
the faculty, building new academic facilities, and enriching the undergraduate
and graduate education experience.[19] During his tenure, Gates encouraged the
addition of 440 new faculty positions and a $300 million campus construction
program, and saw dramatic increases in minority enrollment. On February 2,
2007, Gates was conferred the title of President Emeritus by unanimous vote of
the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents. Gates and his wife Becky
received honorary doctoral degrees from Texas A&M on August 10, 2007.[20]

### [edit] Corporate boards

Gates has been a member of the board of trustees of Fidelity Investments, and
on the board of directors of NACCO Industries, Inc., Brinker International,
Inc., Parker Drilling Company, Science Applications International Corporation,
and VoteHere, a technology company which sought to provide cryptography and
computer software security for the electronic election industry.[21] A White
House spokeswoman has said Gates plans to sell all the stock he owns in
individual companies and sever all ties with them if confirmed by the
Senate.[22]

### [edit] Public service

Gates is a former president of the National Eagle Scout Association.[23]

In January 2004, Gates co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations task force on
U.S. relations towards Iran. Among the task force's primary recommendation was
to directly engage Iran on a diplomatic level regarding Iranian nuclear
technology. Key points included a negotiated position that would allow Iran to
develop its nuclear program in exchange for a commitment from Iran to use the
program only for peaceful means.[24]

At the time of his nomination by President George W. Bush to the position of
Secretary of Defense, Gates was also a member of the Iraq Study Group, also
called the Baker Commission, which was expected to issue its report in
November 2006, following the mid-term election on November 7. He was replaced
by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.

### [edit] Declined appointment as Director of National Intelligence

In February 2005, Gates wrote in a message posted on his school's website that
"there seems to be a growing number of rumors in the media and around campus
that I am leaving Texas A&M to become the new director of national
intelligence in Washington, D.C." The message said that "To put the rumors to
rest, I was indeed asked to take the position, wrestled with perhaps the most
difficult â and close â decision of my life, and last week declined the
position."

Gates committed to remain as President of Texas A&M University through the
summer of 2005; President George W. Bush offered the position of United States
Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to John Negroponte, who accepted.[25]

Gates said in a 2005 discussion with the university's Academy for Future
International Leaders that he had tentatively decided to accept the DNI
position out of a sense of duty and had written an email that would be sent to
students during the press conference to announce his decision, explaining that
he was leaving to serve the U.S. once again. Gates, however, took the weekend
to consider what his final decision should be, and ultimately decided that he
was unwilling to return to Washington, D.C., in any capacity simply because he
"had nothing to look forward to in D.C. and plenty to look forward to at
A&M."[26]

### [edit] Bush Administration

On November 8, 2006, after the 2006 midterm election, President George W. Bush
announced his intent to nominate Gates to succeed the resigning Donald
Rumsfeld as U.S. Secretary of Defense.[27][28]

Gates was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate Armed Services
Committee on December 5, 2006. During his confirmation hearing on December 5,
2006, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan asked Gates if he thought the United
States was winning the war in Iraq, to which Gates responded: "No, sir." He
then went on to say that he did not think the United States was losing the war
either.[29] The next day, Gates was confirmed by the full Senate by a margin
of 95-2, with Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Jim Bunning casting the
two dissenting votes and senators Elizabeth Dole, Evan Bayh, and Joe Biden not
voting.[30] On December 18, 2006, Gates was sworn in as Secretary of Defense
by White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten at a private White House ceremony
and then by Vice President Dick Cheney at the Pentagon. [2]

Several months after his appointment, The Washington Post published a series
of articles beginning February 18, 2007 that brought to the spotlight the
Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal.[31] As a result of the
fallout from the incident, Gates announced the removal of Secretary of the
Army Francis J. Harvey, and later, he approved the removal of Army Surgeon
General Kevin C. Kiley.[32]

On June 8, 2007, Gates announced that he would not recommend the renomination
of Peter Pace, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, due to anticipated
difficulties with the confirmation process. Instead, Gates recommended Mike
Mullen, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, to fill the position.[33]
On June 5, 2008, in response to the findings on Air Force misshipments of
nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons components, Gates announced the
resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and Air Force Chief
of Staff Michael Moseley.[34]

### [edit] Obama Administration

On December 1, 2008, President-elect Obama announced that Robert Gates would
remain in his position as Secretary of Defense during his administration,[7]
reportedly for at least the first year of Obama's presidency.[35] Gates is the
fourteenth Cabinet member in history to serve under two Presidents of
different parties. One of the first priorities under President Barack
Obamaâs administration for Gates will be a review of U.S. policy and
strategy in Afghanistan.[36] Gates, sixth in the presidential line of
succession, was selected as designated survivor during Obama's
inauguration.[37] On March 1, 2009 he told David Gregory on Meet the Press
that he would not commit to how long he would serve as Secretary of Defense
but implied that he would not serve the entire first term.[38]

## [edit] Criticism

<IMG>

<IMG>

Gates responds to a question during the Senate Armed Services Committee
hearing on December 5, 2006

As deputy director and director of America's leading intelligence agency for
many years, Gates and his CIA staff have been faulted for failing to
accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the Soviet Union. More
particularly, Gates has been criticized for concocting evidence to show that
the Soviet Union was stronger than it actually was, and also for repeatedly
skewing intelligence to promote a particular worldview.[39] Also, according to
Newsweek, Gates, as deputy director of CIA, allegedly vouched for the
comprehensiveness of a CIA study presented to the Senate and President Reagan
alleging that the Soviet Union played a role in the 1981 shooting of Pope John
Paul II. A CIA internal review later denounced the report as being skewed,[39]
but that Gates did not try to influence the report's conclusions.[40]

### [edit] NATO Comments

On January 16, 2008, Gates was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying NATO
forces in southern Afghanistan do not know how to properly combat a guerrilla
insurgency and that could be contributing to rising violence in the country
[2]. The Netherlands [3] and United Kingdom [4] protested.
