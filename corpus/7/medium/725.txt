Nix v. Hedden, 149 U.S. 304 (1893)[1], was a case in which the United States
Supreme Court addressed whether a tomato was classified as a fruit or a
vegetable under the Tariff Act of March 3, 1883, which required a tax to be
paid on imported vegetables, but not fruit. The case was filed as an action by
John Nix, John W. Nix, George W. Nix, and Frank W. Nix against Edward L.
Hedden, Collector of the Port of New York, to recover back duties paid under
protest. Botanically a tomato is a fruit. The court, however, unanimously
ruled in favor of the defendant, that the Tariff Act used the ordinary meaning
of the words "fruit" and "vegetable" - where a tomato is classified as a
vegetable - not the technical botanical meaning.

## [edit] The case

At the trial the plaintiff's counsel, after reading in evidence definitions of
the words 'fruit' and 'vegetables' from Webster's Dictionary, Worcester's
Dictionary, and the Imperial Dictionary, called two witnesses, who had been
for 30 years in the business of selling fruit and vegetables, and asked them,
after hearing these definitions, to say whether these words had "any special
meaning in trade or commerce, different from those read."

During testimony, one witness testified that in regard to the dictionary
definition:

    "[the dictionary] does not classify all things there, but they are correct as far as they go. It does not take all kinds of fruit or vegetables; it takes a portion of them. I think the words 'fruit' and 'vegetable' have the same meaning in trade today that they had on March 1, 1883. I understand that the term 'fruit' is applied in trade only to such plants or parts of plants as contain the seeds. There are more vegetables than those in the enumeration given in Webster's Dictionary under the term 'vegetable,' as 'cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, potatoes, peas, beans, and the like,' probably covered by the words 'and the like.'"
Another witness testified that "I don't think the term 'fruit' or the term
'vegetables' had, in March 1883, and prior thereto, any special meaning in
trade and commerce in this country different from that which I have read here
from the dictionaries."[1]

Both the plaintiff's counsel and the defendant's counsel made use of the
dictionaries. The plaintiff's counsel read in evidence from the same
dictionaries the definitions of the word tomato, while the defendant's counsel
then read in evidence from Webster's Dictionary the definitions of the words
pea, egg plant, cucumber, squash, and pepper. Countering this, the plaintiff
then read in evidence from Webster's and Worcester's dictionaries the
definitions of potato, turnip, parsnip, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and bean.

## [edit] The Court's decision

Botanically, a tomato is a fruit. However, in common parlance it is seen as a
vegetable, hence the United States Supreme Court ruled that legally, a tomato
is a vegetable.

The court unanimously decided in favor of the defense and found that the
tomato was classified as a vegetable, based on the ways in which it is used,
and the popular perception to this end. Justice Horace Gray, writing the
opinion for the Court, stated that:

> "The passages cited from the dictionaries define the word 'fruit' as the
seed of plants, or that part of plants which contains the seed, and especially
the juicy, pulpy products of certain plants, covering and containing the seed.
These definitions have no tendency to show that tomatoes are 'fruit,' as
distinguished from 'vegetables,' in common speech, or within the meaning of
the tariff act."

Justice Gray cited several different Supreme Court cases (Brown v. Piper, 91
U.S. 37, 42, and Jones v. U.S., 137 U.S. 202, 216) and stated that when words
have acquired any special meaning in trade or commerce the ordinary meaning
must be used by the court. In this case dictionaries cannot be admitted as
evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court. Gray
acknowledged that, botanically, tomatoes are classified as a "fruit of the
vine", nevertheless they are seen as vegetables because they were usually
eaten as a main course instead of being eaten as a dessert. In making his
decision, Justice Gray mentioned another case where it had been claimed that
beans were seeds â Justice Bradley, in Robertson v. Salomon, 130 U.S. 412,
414, similarly found that though a bean is botanically a seed, in common
parlance a bean is seen as a vegetable. While on the subject, Gray clarified
the status of the cucumber, squash, pea, and bean.

## [edit] Subsequent history

Nix has been cited in three Supreme Court decisions as a precedent for court
interpretation of common meanings, especially dictionary definitions. (Sonn v.
Maggone, 159 U.S. 417 (1895); Saltonstall v. Wiebusch & Hilger, 156 U.S. 601
(1895); and Cadwalder v. Zeh, 151 U.S. 171 (1894)). Additionally, in JSG
Trading Corp. v. Tray-Wrap, Inc., 917 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1990), a case unrelated
to Nix aside from the shared focus on tomatoes, a judge wrote the following
paragraph citing the case:

    "In common parlance tomatoes are vegetables, as the Supreme Court observed long ago, see Nix v. Hedden 149 U.S. 304, 307, 13 S.Ct. 881, 882, 37 L.Ed. 745 (1893), although botanically speaking they are actually a fruit. 26 Encyclopedia Americana 832 (Int'l. ed. 1981). Regardless of classification, people have been enjoying tomatoes for centuries, even Mr. Pickwick, as Dickens relates, ate his chops in 'tomata' sauce."
In 2005, supporters in the New Jersey legislature cited Nix as a basis for a
bill designating the tomato as the official state vegetable.[2]
