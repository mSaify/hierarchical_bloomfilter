Since 2007, the Doomsday Clock has read five-minutes-to-midnight.

The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face, maintained since 1947 by the
board of directors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists at the University
of Chicago, that uses the analogy of the human species being at a time that is
"minutes to midnight", wherein midnight represents "catastrophic destruction".
Originally, the analogy represented the threat of global nuclear war, but
since includes climate-changing technologies and "new developments in the life
sciences and nanotechnology that could inflict irrevocable harm".[1]

Since its inception, the clock has appeared on every cover of the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists. Its first representation was in 1947, when magazine co-
founder Hyman Goldsmith asked artist Martyl Langsdorf (wife of Manhattan
Project physicist Alexander Langsdorf, Jr.) to design a cover for the
magazine's June 1947 issue.

The number of minutes before midnight â measuring the degree of nuclear,
environmental, and technological threats to mankind â is periodically
corrected; currently, the clock reads five minutes to midnight, having
advanced two minutes on 17 January 2007.

Cover of the 1947 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists issue that first featured
the Doomsday Clock at seven minutes to midnight.

In 1947 during the U.S.âU.S.S.R. Cold War, the clock was started at seven
minutes to midnight, and subsequently advanced and rewound per the state of
the world and nuclear war prospects. Setting the clock is relatively
arbitrary, and decided by the directors of the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists reflecting global affairs. The clock has not always been set and
reset as quickly as events occur; the closest nuclear war threat, the Cuban
Missile Crisis in 1962, reached crisis, climax, and resolution before it could
be set to reflect that possible doomsday.

The most recent officially-announced setting â five minutes to midnight â
was on 17 January 2007.[1][2] Reflecting international events dangerous to
mankind, the clock hands have been set eighteen times, since its initial start
at seven minutes to midnight in 1947.

further reducing stockpiles.  
2002 7 11:53pm â2 Little progress on global nuclear disarmament; United
States rejects a series of arms control treaties and announces its intentions
to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty; concerns about the
possibility of a nuclear terrorist attack due to the amount of weapon-grade
nuclear materials that are unsecured and unaccounted for worldwide.  
2007 5 11:55pm â2 North Korea's test of a nuclear weapon, Iran's alleged
nuclear ambitions, a renewed U.S. emphasis on the military utility of nuclear
weapons, the failure to adequately secure nuclear materials, and the continued
presence of some 26,000 nuclear weapons in the United States and Russia.[3]
Experts assessing the dangers posed to civilization have added climate change
to the prospect of nuclear annihilation as the greatest threats to
humankind.[4]  
## [edit] In popular culture

### [edit] In literature and film

  * The clock used in the Watchmen comic book series is a reference to The Doomsday Clock. The Clock continues to tick til midnight as the story progresses, just to be averted in the final 2 chapters. On page 18 of issue #1, a newspaper on Adrian Veidt's desk bears the headline "Nuclear Doomsday Clock Stands At Five To Twelve, Warn Experts". Clocks on walls throughout the series display this time. This motif is preserved in the film adaptation.
  * The Doomsday Clock is referenced in Piers Anthony's novel, Wielding a Red Sword, in which the mythical Incarnation of War can control the position of the hands up to midnight and thereby bring about World War III.

### [edit] In music

  * The Doomsday Clock is alluded to throughout "2 Minutes to Midnight", a single from Iron Maiden's album Powerslave. In the cover of the band's single, the mascot Eddie is sitting in front of a ruined United Nations building with the flags of nations flying at half-mast. A nuclear explosion is in the background.
  * Linkin Park's third album, Minutes to Midnight, is a reference to the Doomsday Clock. In the music video for "Shadow of the Day", the current time is shown at the beginning of the video; by the end, it would have nearly reached midnight.[5]

### [edit] In television

  * The Doctor Who episode "Four to Doomsday" was first aired in 1982, when the clock was at four minutes to midnight.
  * The NCIS episode "Murder 2.0" features an image of the Doomsday clock used as a clue that the Cybervid Killer's next murder will take place at five minutes to midnight, the time at which the clock is currently set.
  * The Heroes episode "Seven Minutes to Midnight" aired in 2006, when the clock was set at seven minutes to midnight. The season dealt with the main characters stopping a nuclear bomb going off in New York City.
