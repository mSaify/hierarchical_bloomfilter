The firm has employed political figures and notable investors. Some of these

of State James A. Baker III. The State of New York is currently investigating
the firm in connection to an illegal kickback scheme with the state's pension
fund.[2]

## [edit] Investment focus

Carlyle invests primarily in the following industries: aerospace and defense,
automotive, consumer and retail, energy and power, health care, real estate,
technology and business services, telecommunications and media, and
transportation. The Carlyle Group's investments are focused on East Asia,
Europe and North America, with most investment money coming from the United
States (65%), Europe (25%), Asia (6%), Latin America, and the Middle
East.[citation needed] Defense investments represent about 1% of the group's
current portfolio;[citation needed] for example, Carlyle owns 33.8% of
QinetiQ,[citation needed] the recently privatized British defense contractor.

Carlyle was founded in 1987 by Stephen L. Norris and David M. Rubenstein.[3]
As they wanted the firm to outlive them, Norris and Rubenstein named the firm
after the Upper East Side area hotel in New York City, the Carlyle Hotel,
where they first met to discuss the idea.

Norris and Rubenstein later hired Dan D'Aniello, William Conway and Greg
Rosenbaum.[4] Rosenbaum left in 1987[5]; Norris left in 1995[6]. The three
remaining founders are reported to collectively own around a 50% interest in
the group's general partnership.

Carlyle has only allowed two outsiders to buy into its partnership. The
California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) is the only US
institution which owns a stake in the partnership, holding 5.5% of Carlyle for
which it paid $175 million in 2001 and which was worth about $1 billion by
2007.[7] In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment
vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased
a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[7]

Carlyle's current chairman is Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and
Nabisco. Carlyle is the largest private equity firm in the world, according to
a ranking called the PEI 50.

### [edit] Current portfolio and major acquisitions

Though known for its expertise in aerospace and defense, Carlyle invested more
than thirty percent of its assets in telecommunications and media. Noted
portfolio companies are Dex Media, the former directories business of Qwest
Communications; Willcom, a Japanese wireless company; Casema, a Dutch cable
company; and Insight Communications, the ninth largest cable company in the
U.S. The Carlyle Group was once a major investor in US Investigations
Services, which is the privatized arm of the United States Office of Personnel
Management's Office of Federal Investigations, but has since divested itself,
selling its stake to Providence Equity Partners in 2007.[citation needed]

Brand-name companies that Carlyle owns include: Dunkin' Brands, which owns
Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, and oral hygiene company Water Pik. Carlyle
also recently took rental car company Hertz public.

On January 29, 2007, Carlyle announced that it would acquire Synagro
Technologies, Inc, which according to Synagro's website is "the largest
recycler of biosolids and other organic residuals in the United States". The
total enterprise value of the transaction, including the assumption of debt,
is $772 million.[8]

On June 28, 2007, Carlyle announced that it would partner with Onex
Corporation to buy the Allison Transmission unit from General Motors for $5.6
billion.[9]

In June 2007, Carlyle agrees to acquire HD Supply for $10.3 billion, along
with Bain Capital and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (with each agreeing to buy a
one-third stake in the division). Home Depot sold their wholesale construction
supply business to fund a stock repurchase estimated at $40 billion

On July 2, 2007, it was disclosed that the Carlyle Group was looking to buy
Virgin Media UK cable business.[10] Richard Branson is the largest
shareholder, and the Virgin Group own the name Virgin, and Virgin Media have
the rights to use the name Virgin for 10 years[citation needed].

On July 28, 2007, Carlyle announced the acquisition of Applus+ from its
shareholders Agbar, UniÃ³n Fenosa and Caja Madrid for an enterprise value of
â¬1,480 million.[11]

On December 18, 2007, David Rubenstein, representing the Carlyle Group,
purchased the Magna Carta (one of seventeen copies) at Sotheby's Auction House
in New York City. He paid the Perot Foundation $21.3 million. Mr. Rubenstein
expressed his intent for it to be returned to the National Archives for
display.

On May 16, 2008, Booz Allen Hamilton announced that it would selling a
majority stake in the US government business to The Carlyle Group for $2.54
billion. The transaction was expected to be complete July 31, 2008.[12]

On August 2008, Carlyle Group bought IRIS Unified Ag through FRS Global.

Carlyle acquired United Defense Industries in October 1997, bringing in over
60% of Carlyle's defense business. United Defense went public on the New York
Stock Exchange in December 2001 with Carlyle retaining a stock ownership
position. Carlyle completed the sale of all of its United Defense stock and
exited the investment in April 2004.[13] (One major United Defense program was
the XM2001 Crusader self-propelled howitzer which was canceled by Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in early 2002 causing United Defense stock prices to
fall 27 percent.[14])

### [edit] Carlyle Capital Corporation

In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[15] for
the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities,
defaulted on about US$ 16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch
brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged
investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged
, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its
remaining assets.[16] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of
Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on
its loans.[17] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets
caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit
markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary
dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of
up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities. [18] On
March 12, 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the
mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect,
giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle
Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining
assets."[19] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A
Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a
petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[20]
for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to
be liquidated by a court appointed liquidator.[21]

The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital is
reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[22]

### [edit] Documentaries

Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries, Michael Moore's
Fahrenheit 911 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.

In the documentary film Fahrenheit 911, Michael Moore makes nine allegations
concerning the Carlyle Group, including: That the Bin Laden and Bush families
were both connected to the Group; that following the attacks on September 11,
the bin Laden familyâs investments in the Carlyle Group became an
embarrassment to the Carlyle Group and the family was forced to liquidate
their assets with the firm; that the Carlyle group is, in essence, the 11th
largest defense contractor in the United States.[23] Moore focused on
Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, both of whom had at times served as advisors to the firm.

A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries
was far less than several other Private equity firms.[24] Carlyle also has
provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the
relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[25]

In his documentary The World According to Bush (May 2004), William Karel
interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama
bin Laden's estranged brother at Carlyle's annual investor conference while
the September 11 attacks were occurring.[25][26]

## [edit] Controversial Legislation

In February 2008, a US Senate bill was introduced that would increase the
regulation of nursing homes such as those run by HCR Manor Care which Carlyle
purchased in December 2007.[27]

Furthermore in February 2008, a bill was introduced in California that would
have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are
partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights," which would
include Carlyle because Mubadala Development is owned by part of the United
Arab Emirates. The California bill was later withdrawn.[28]
