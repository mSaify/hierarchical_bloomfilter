Thanksgiving Day is a harvest festival. Traditionally, it is a time to give
thanks for the harvest and express gratitude in general. It is a holiday
celebrated primarily in Canada and the United States. While perhaps religious
in origin, Thanksgiving is now primarily identified as a secular holiday.

The date and location of the first Thanksgiving celebration is a topic of
modest contention. Though the earliest attested Thanksgiving celebration was
on September 8, 1565 in what is now Saint Augustine, Florida[1][2], the
traditional "first Thanksgiving" is venerated as having occurred at the site
of Plymouth Plantation, in 1621.

Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October in Canada
and on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. Thanksgiving
dinner is held on this day, usually as a gathering of family members and
friends.

## [edit] Canada

Main article: Thanksgiving (Canada)

Thanksgiving in Canada occurs on the second Monday in October and Canadians
give thanks at the close of the harvest season. Although some people thank God
for this bounty[3], the holiday is mainly considered secular.

## [edit] United States

Main article: Thanksgiving (United States)

In the United States, Thanksgiving takes place on the fourth Thursday in
November. On that date in 1621, the European settlers in Plymouth,
Massachusetts, gave their thanks to God for letting them survive their first
year in the New World. They celebrated by having a large feast or dinner. The
Indians who had helped them were invited to that feast. Nowadays, Thanksgiving
is a holiday reserved for family and close friends. On that occasion, members
of the same family who live far away get together for a big dinner, some
traveling many thousands of miles. This traditional dinner reproduces the food
the Plymouth colonists served in 1621: turkey, sweet potatoes or yams, squash,
corn, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. The period from Thanksgiving Day to
New Year's Day is often called the holiday season.

## [edit] Grenada

In Grenada there is a national holiday of Thanksgiving Day on 25 October. It
is unrelated to holidays in Canada and the United States even though it bears
the same name and occurs around the same time. It marks the anniversary of the
U.S.-led invasion of the island in 1983 in response to the deposition and
execution of Grenadan Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.[4]

## [edit] Netherlands

A Thanksgiving Day service is held in Leidenâs 15th century gothic church.
The Pilgrims stopped in Leiden on their way to the Americas.[5]

"The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609, after fleeing religious persecution in England. Leiden welcomed them because it needed immigrants to help rebuild its textile industry, which had been devastated by a long revolt against Spain. Here, the Pilgrims were allowed to worship as they wanted, and they even published their arguments calling for the separation of church and state. Jeremy Bangs directs the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum. He says the Pilgrims quickly adopted several Dutch customs, like civil marriage and Thanksgiving."
