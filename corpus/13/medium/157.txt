Premature ejaculation (PE), also known as rapid ejaculation, rapid climax,
premature climax or early ejaculation , affects 25%-40% of men in the U.S.
Masters and Johnson stated that a man suffers from premature ejaculation if he
ejaculates before his sex partner achieves orgasm in more than fifty percent
of their sexual encounters. Other sex researchers have defined premature
ejaculation as occurring if the man ejaculates within two minutes of
penetration; however, a survey by Alfred Kinsey in the 1950s demonstrated that
three quarters of men ejaculate within two minutes of penetration in over half
of their sexual encounters.[citation needed]. Self reported surveys report up
to 75% of men ejaculate within 10 minutes of penetration [1] Today, most sex
therapists understand premature ejaculation as occurring when a lack of
ejaculatory control interferes with sexual or emotional well-being in one or
both partners.[citation needed]

The term "premature ejaculation" is not well defined in medical circles and is
sometimes considered to be more of a marketing tool than a medical condition.
By widely advertising PE/ED as a problem, an industry has been created to
solve what in the past might not have been a great concern. The psychological
effects of PE and ED have also been considered similar to the effects on young
women of the thin model paradigm.[citation needed]

Most men experience premature ejaculation at least once in their lives.
Because there is great variability in both how long it takes men to ejaculate
and how long both partners want sex to last, researchers have begun to form a
quantitative definition of premature ejaculation. Current evidence supports an
average intravaginal ejaculation latency time of six and a half minutes in
18-30 year olds.[1][2] If the disorder is defined as an IELT percentile below
2.5, then premature ejaculation could be suggested by an IELT of less than
about one and a half minutes.[3] Nevertheless, it is well accepted that men
with IELTs below 1.5 minutes could be "happy" with their performance and do
not report a lack of control and therefore do not suffer from PE. On the other
hand, a man with 2 minutes IELT may have the perception of poor control over
his ejaculation, distressed about his condition, has interpersonal
difficulties and therefore be diagnosed with PE.

## [edit] Possible psychological and environmental factors

Psychological factors commonly contribute to premature ejaculation. While men
sometimes underestimate the relationship between sexual performance and
emotional well-being, premature ejaculation can be caused by temporary
depression, stress over financial matters, unrealistic expectations about
performance, a history of sexual repression, or an overall lack of confidence.
Interpersonal dynamics strongly contribute to sexual function, and premature
ejaculation can be caused by a lack of communication between partners, hurt
feelings, or unresolved conflicts that interfere with the ability to achieve
emotional intimacy. Neurological premature ejaculation can also lead to other
forms of sexual dysfunction, or intensify the existing problem, by creating
performance anxiety. In a less pathological context, premature ejaculation
could also be simply caused by extreme arousal.

According to the theories developed by Wilhelm Reich, premature ejaculation
may be a consequence of a stasis of sexual energy in the pelvic musculature
which prevents the diffusion of such energy to other parts of the body.[4]

One study of young married couples (Tullberg, 1999) reported that the
husband's IELT seems to be affected by the phases of the wife's menstrual
cycle, the IELT tending to be shortest during the fertile phase. Other studies
suggest that young men with older female partners reach the ejaculatory
threshold sooner, on average, than those whose partners are their own age or
younger[citation needed].

## [edit] Possible physical factors

### [edit] Science of mechanism of ejaculation

The physical process of ejaculation requires two sequential actions: emission
and expulsion.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Mechanism of Ejaculation

The emission phase is the first phase. It involves deposition of seminal fluid
from the ampullary vas deferens, seminal vesicles and prostate gland into
posterior urethra.[5] The second phase is the expulsion phase. It involves
closure of bladder neck, followed by the rhythmic contractions of the urethra
by pelvic-perineal and bulbospongiosus muscle, and intermittent relaxation of
external urethral sphincters.[6]

It is believed that the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) plays a central role
in modulating ejaculation. Several animal studies have demonstrated its
inhibitory effect on ejaculation. Therefore, it is perceived that low level of
serotonin in the synaptic cleft in these specific areas in the brain could
cause premature ejaculation. This theory is further supported by the proven
effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which
increase serotonin level in the synapse, in treating PE.

Sympathetic motor neurons control the emission phase of ejaculation reflex and
expulsion phase is executed by somatic and autonomic motor neurons. These
motor neurons are located in the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral spinal cord and
are activated in a coordinated manner when sufficient sensory input to reach
the ejaculatory threshold has entered the central nervous system.[7][8]

Several areas in the brain, and especially the nucleus paragigantocellularis,
have been identified to be involved in ejaculatory control.[9] Scientists have
long suspected a genetic link to certain forms of premature ejaculation. In
one study, ninety-one percent of men who suffered from lifelong premature
ejaculation also had a first-relative with lifelong premature ejaculation.
Other researchers have noted that men who suffer from premature ejaculation
have a faster neurological response in the pelvic muscles. Simple exercises
commonly suggested by sex therapists can significantly improve ejaculatory
control for men with premature ejaculation caused by neurological
factors[citation needed]. Often, these men may benefit from anti-anxiety
medication or SSRIs, such as sertraline or paroxetine, as these slow down
ejaculation times[2]. Some men prefer using anaesthetic creams, however, these
creams may also deaden sensations in the man's partner, and are not generally
recommended by sex therapists.

## [edit] Diagnosis

Diagnostic criteria for Premature Ejaculation DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
Association)

A. Persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before,
on, or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it. The
clinician must take into account factors that affect duration of the
excitement phase, such as age, novelty of the sexual partner or situation, and
recent frequency of sexual activity.

B. The disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.

C. The premature ejaculation is not due exclusively to the direct effects of a
substance (e.g., withdrawal from opioids).

### [edit] Differential diagnosis

Premature ejaculation should be distinguished from erectile dysfunction
related to the development of a general medical condition. Some individuals
with erectile dysfunction may omit their usual strategies for delaying orgasm.
Others require prolonged noncoital stimulation to develop a degree of erection
sufficient for intromission. In such individuals, sexual arousal may be so
high that ejaculation occurs immediately. Occasional problems with premature
ejaculation that are not persistent or recurrent or are not accompanied by
marked distress or interpersonal difficulty do not qualify for the diagnosis
of premature ejaculation. The clinician should also take into account the
individual's age, overall sexual experience, recent sexual activity, and the
novelty of the partner. When problems with premature ejaculation are due
exclusively to substance use (e.g., opioid withdrawal), a substance-induced
sexual dysfunction can be diagnosed.

### [edit] Ejaculation disorder types

  * Premature ejaculation - Ejaculation occurs very early
  * Delayed ejaculation \- Ejaculation takes a long time
  * Retrograde ejaculation \- Semen flows from the prostate gland into the bladder rather than exiting out of the penis.
  * Inhibited orgasm in males[10]

In mundane cases, treatments are focused on gradually training and improving
mental habituation to sex and physical development of stimulation control. In
clinical cases, various medications are being tested to help slow down the
speed of the arousal response.

Masters and Johnson recommended a start and stop technique to increase the
time till ejaculation. This requires a great deal of couple cooperation and
communication and may be difficult for some.

Another method is that of control not prevention. Performing routines such as
Kegel exercises which as above mention relate to gaining the voluntary control
of the PC Muscle and thus give a person more control over this muscle. When
ejaculating the control of this muscle is said to be lost and thus learning to
keep control of it can be of aid to some.

### [edit] Natural Treatments

<IMG>

The Kegel Male Exercise Trainer

Kegel exercises appear to enable some men to have multiple orgasms and can
help with premature ejaculation. The Kegel Male Exercise Trainer (also called
The Stud Trainer) is a male resistance exercise device created by Florida
entrepreneur and inventor, Al Dana. It is a PC muscle exerciser that serves as
an alternative to pharmaceutical male enhancement products. These Kegel
exercises, patterned after the research of Dr. Arnold Kegel may provide a
natural substitute to pills such as Viagra, Levitra and Cialis with have been
found to have negative side effects and risks.

### [edit] Medications

Serotonergic medications, such as SSRIs can delay ejaculation.[11][12] SSRIs
are commonly used as anti-depressants. Examples include Prozac, Zoloft,
Celexa, Effexor, and Lexapro. Clinical trials indicate that Paroxetine gives
the largest increase in intravaginal ejaculation latency time.[13]
Clomipramine often helps with serious cases which are related to the central
nervous system (as opposed to psychological factors). The drug has the added
benefit of also improving erection quality in some patients.[14]

William Francis Ganong, cited dietary 5-HTP as an alternative source to
raising serotonin levels. Many supplements are available that contain 5-HTP. A
popular one is called Detain X.

Medical grade topical anesthetics are a common ingredient in many over-the-
counter products such as condoms and non-aerosol sprays.[15][16]

Magnesium deficiency, very common in the Western world and especially in the
United States, has been associated with premature ejaculation. See: Seminal
plasma magnesium and premature ejaculation: a case-control study.
