Debt is that which is owed; usually referencing assets owed, but the term can
also cover moral obligations and other interactions not requiring money. In
the case of assets, debt is a means of using future purchasing power in the
present before a summation has been earned. Some companies and corporations
use debt as a part of their overall corporate finance strategy.[citation
needed]

A debt is created when a creditor agrees to lend a sum of assets to a debtor.
In modern society, debt is usually granted with expected repayment; in many
cases, plus interest. Historically, debt was responsible for the creation of
indentured servants.

## [edit] Etymology

The word comes from the Old French dette and ultimately Latin debere to owe,
from de habere to have. The B was reintroduced in the 17th century, possibly
by Samuel Johnson in his Dictionary of 1755â several other words that had
existed without a B had them reinserted at around that time.

## [edit] Payment

Before a debt can be made, both the debtor and the creditor must agree on the
manner in which the debt will be repaid, known as the standard of deferred
payment. This payment is usually denominated as a sum of money in units of
currency, but can sometimes be denominated in terms of goods. Payment can be
made in increments over a period of time, or all at once at the end of the
loan agreement.

## [edit] Types of debt

A company uses various kinds of debt to finance its operations. The various
types of debt can generally be categorized into: 1) secured and unsecured
debt, 2) private and public debt, 3) syndicated and bilateral debt, and 4)
other types of debt that display one or more of the characteristics noted
above.[1]

A debt obligation is considered secured if creditors have recourse to the
assets of the company on a proprietary basis or otherwise ahead of general
claims against the company. Unsecured debt comprises financial obligations,
where creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the borrower to satisfy
their claims.

Private debt comprises bank-loan type obligations, whether senior or
mezzanine. Public debt is a general definition covering all financial
instruments that are freely tradeable on a public exchange or over the
counter, with few if any restrictions.

Loan syndication is a risk management tool that allows the lead banks
underwriting the debt to reduce their risk and free up lending capacity.

A basic loan is the simplest form of debt. It consists of an agreement to lend
a principal sum for a fixed period of time, to be repaid by a certain date. In
commercial loans interest, calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per
year, will also have to be paid by that date.

In some loans, the amount actually loaned to the debtor is less than the
principal sum to be repaid; the additional principal has the same economic
effect as a higher interest rate (see point (mortgage)).

A syndicated loan is a loan that is granted to companies that wish to borrow
more money than any single lender is prepared to risk in a single loan,
usually many millions of dollars. In such a case, a syndicate of banks can
each agree to put forward a portion of the principal sum.

A bond is a debt security issued by certain institutions such as companies and
governments. A bond entitles the holder to repayment of the principal sum,
plus interest. Bonds are issued to investors in a marketplace when an
institution wishes to borrow money. Bonds have a fixed lifetime, usually a
number of years; with long-term bonds, lasting over 30 years, being less
common. At the end of the bond's life the money should be repaid in full.
Interest may be added to the end payment, or can be paid in regular
installments (known as coupons) during the life of the bond. Bonds may be
traded in the bond markets, and are widely used as relatively safe investments
in comparison to equity.

## [edit] Accounting debt

In national accounting, debts are added according to those who are indebted.
Household debt is the debt held by households. "National" or Public debt is
the debt held by the various governmental institutions (federal government,
states, cities ...). Business debt is the debt held by businesses. Financial
debt is the debt held by the financial sector (from one financial institution
to another). Total debt is the sum of all those debts, excluding financial
debt to prevent double accounting. These various types of debt can be computed
in debt/GDP ratios. Those ratios help to assess the speed of variations in the
indebtness and the size of the debt due. For example the USA have a high
consumer debt and a low public debt, while in eastern European countries, for
example, the opposite tends to be true.

There are differences in the accounting of debt for private and public agents.
If a private agent promises to pay something later, it has a debt, and this
debt is enforceable by public agents. If a public body passes a law stating
that it'll pay something later (a kind of promise), it keeps the right to
change the law later (and not to pay). This is why, for instance, the money
governments promised to pay for retirements does not show up in the public
debt assessment, whereas the money private companies promised to pay for
retirements do.

### [edit] Securitization

Main article: Securitization

Securitization occurs when a company groups together assets or receivables and
sells them in units to the market through a trust. Any asset with a cashflow
can be securitized. The cash flows from these receivables are used to pay the
holders of these units. Companies often do this in order to remove these
assets from their balance sheets and monetize an asset. Although these assets
are "removed" from the balance sheet and are supposed to be the responsibility
of the trust, that does not end the company's involvement. Often the company
maintains a special interest in the trust which is called an "interest only
strip" or "first loss piece". Any payments from the trust must be made to
regular investors in precedence to this interest. This protects investors from
a degree of risk, making the securitization more attractive. The
aforementioned brings into question whether the assets are truly off-balance-
sheet given the company's exposure to losses on this interest.

## [edit] Debt, inflation and the exchange rate

As noted above, debt is normally denominated in a particular monetary
currency, and so changes in the valuation of that currency can change the
effective size of the debt. This can happen due to inflation or deflation, so
it can happen even though the borrower and the lender are using the same
currency. Thus it is important to agree on standards of deferred payment in
advance, so that a degree of fluctuation will also be agreed as acceptable. It
is for instance common[citation needed] to agree to "US dollar denominated"
debt.

The form of debt involved in banking accounts for a large proportion of the
money in most industrialised nations (see money and credit money for a
discussion of this). There is therefore a relationship between inflation,
deflation, the money supply, and debt. The store of value represented by the
entire economy of the industrialized nation, and the state's ability to levy
tax on it, acts to the foreign holder of debt as a guarantee of repayment,
since industrial goods are in high demand in many places worldwide.

### [edit] Inflation indexed debt

Borrowing and repayment arrangements linked to inflation-indexed units of
account are possible and are used in some countries. For example, the US
government issues two types of inflation-indexed bonds, Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds. These are one of the safest forms of
investment available, since the only major source of risk â that of
inflation â is eliminated. A number of other governments issue similar
bonds, and some did so for many years before the US government.

In countries with consistently high inflation, ordinary borrowings at banks
may also be inflation indexed.

Lendings to stable financial entities such as large companies or governments
are often termed "risk free" or "low risk" and made at a so-called "risk-free
interest rate". This is because the debt and interest are highly unlikely to
be defaulted. A good example of such risk-free interest is a US Treasury
security \- it yields the minimum return available in economics, but investors
have the comfort of the (almost) certain expectation that the US Treasury will
not default on its debt instruments. A risk-free rate is also commonly used in
setting floating interest rates, which are usually calculated as the risk-free
interest rate plus a bonus to the creditor based on the creditworthiness of
the debtor (in other words, the risk of him defaulting and the creditor losing
the debt). In reality, no lending is truly risk free, but borrowers at the
"risk free" rate are considered the least likely to default.

However, if the real value of a currency changes during the term of the debt,
the purchasing power of the money repaid may vary considerably from that which
was expected at the commencement of the loan. So from a practical investment
point of view, there is still considerable risk attached to "risk free" or
"low risk" lendings. The real value of the money may have changed due to
inflation, or, in the case of a foreign investment, due to exchange rate
fluctuations.

The Bank for International Settlements is an organisation of central banks
that sets rules to define how much capital banks have to hold against the
loans they give out.

### [edit] Ratings and creditworthiness

Specific bond debts owed by both governments and private corporations is rated
by rating agencies, such as Moody's, Fitch Ratings Inc., A. M. Best and
Standard & Poor's. The government or company itself will also be given its own
separate rating. These agencies assess the ability of the debtor to honor his
obligations and accordingly give him a credit rating. Moody's uses the letters
Aaa Aa A Baa Ba B Caa Ca C, where ratings Aa-Caa are qualified by numbers 1-3.
Munich Re, for example, currently is rated Aa3 (as of 2004[update]). S&P and
other rating agencies have slightly different systems using capital letters
and +/- qualifiers.

A change in ratings can strongly affect a company, since its cost of
refinancing depends on its creditworthiness. Bonds below Baa/BBB (Moody's/S&P)
are considered junk- or high risk bonds. Their high risk of default
(approximately 1.6% for Ba) is compensated by higher interest payments. Bad
Debt is a loan that can not (partially or fully) be repaid by the debtor. The
debtor is said to default on his debt. These types of debt are frequently
repackaged and sold below face value. Buying junk bonds is seen as a risky but
potentially profitable form of investment.

### [edit] Cancellation

Short of bankruptcy, it is rare that debts are wholly or partially forgiven.
Traditions in some cultures demand that this be done on a regular (often
annual) basis, in order to prevent systemic inequities between groups in
society, or anyone becoming a specialist in holding debt and coercing
repayment. Under English law, when the creditor is deceived into forgoing
payment, this is a crime: see Theft Act 1978.

International Third World debt has reached the scale that many economists are
convinced that debt cancellation is the only way to restore global equity in
relations with the developing nations.

## [edit] Effects of debt

Debt allows people and organizations to do things that they would otherwise
not be able, or allowed, to do. Commonly, people in industrialised nations use
it to purchase houses, cars and many other things too expensive to buy with
cash on hand. Companies also use debt in many ways to leverage the investment
made in their assets, "leveraging" the return on their equity. This leverage,
the proportion of debt to equity, is considered important in determining the
riskiness of an investment; the more debt per equity, the riskier. For both
companies and individuals, this increased risk can lead to poor results, as
the cost of servicing the debt can grow beyond the ability to pay due to
either external events (income loss) or internal difficulties (poor management
of resources).

Excesses in debt accumulation have been blamed for exacerbating economic
problems.[2] For example, prior to the beginning of the Great Depression
debt/GDP ratio was very high. Economic agents were heavily indebted. This
excess of debt, equivalent to excessive expectations on future returns,
accompanied asset bubbles on the stock markets. When expectations corrected,
deflation and a credit crunch followed. Deflation effectively made debt more
expensive and, as Fisher explained, this reinforced deflation again, because,
in order to reduce their debt level, economic agents reduced their consumption
and investment. The reduction in demand reduced business activity and caused
further unemployment. In a more direct sense, more bankruptcies also occurred
due both to increased debt cost caused by deflation and the reduced demand.

It is possible for some organizations to enter into alternative types of
borrowing and repayment arrangements which will not result in bankruptcy. For
example, companies can sometimes convert debt that they owe into equity in
themselves. In this case, the creditor hopes to regain something equivalent to
the debt and interest in the form of dividends and capital gains of the
borrower. The "repayments" are therefore proportional to what the borrower
earns and so can not in themselves cause bankruptcy. Once debt is converted in
this way, it is no longer known as debt.

## [edit] Arguments against debt

Main article: Criticism of debt

Some argue against debt as an instrument and institution, on a personal,
family, social, corporate and governmental level. Islam forbids lending with
interest even today, while the Catholic church allowed it from 1822 onwards,
and the Torah states that all debts should be erased every 7 years and every
50 years.

Debt will increase through time if it is not repaid faster than it grows
through interest. This effect may be termed usury, while the term "usury" in
other contexts refers only to an excessive rate of interest, in excess of a
reasonable profit for the risk accepted.

In international legal thought, Odious debt is debt that is incurred by a
regime for purposes that do not serve the interest of the state. Such debts
are thus considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that
incurred them and not debts of the state.

In an economy with high interest rates, debt will be more costly to a business
than more flexible dividends on equity investment. It may be easier for a
struggling business to be financed through equity investment as it may be
possible to avoid paying a dividend if times are hard.

## [edit] Levels and flows

Main article: Debt levels and flows

Global debt underwriting grew 4.3% year-over-year to $5.19 trillion during
2004. It is expected to rise in the coming years if the spending habits of
millions of people worldwide continue the way they do.
