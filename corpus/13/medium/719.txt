## [edit] Types

Traditional vasectomy involves making 2 small incisions at the scrotum
allowing a surgeon to gain access to the vas deferens. The "tubes" are cut and
then tied, stitched, cauterized (burned), or otherwise clamped to prevent
sperm from entering the seminal stream. Variations of the procedure have been
explored/used in hopes of reducing pain (in recovery and long-term) and
recovery time. No-Scalpel vasectomy is one example,[2] in which a sharp
hemostat, rather than a scalpel, is used to puncture the scrotum. An "open
ended" vasectomy obstructs (seals) only the top end of the vas deferens. This
method allows continued streaming of sperm (by virtue of the un-sealed vas-
deferens) into the scrotum, which may avoid build-up of pressure in the
epididymis. Testicular pain (from "backup pressure") seems to be reduced using
this method.[3]

## [edit] Side effects

After vasectomy, the testes remain in the scrotum where Leydig cells continue
to produce testosterone and other male hormones that continue to be secreted
into the blood stream. Some studies find that sexual desire is unaffected in
over 90% of vasectomized men,[4] whereas other studies find higher rates of
diminished sexual desire.[5] The sperm-filled fluid from the testes
contributes about 10% to the volume of an ejaculation (in men who are not
vasectomized) and does not significantly affect the appearance, taste,
texture, or smell of the ejaculate.[6]

When the vasectomy is complete, sperm can no longer exit the body through the
penis. The testicles continue to produce sperm, but they are broken down and
absorbed by the body. Much fluid content is absorbed by membranes in the
epididymis, and much solid content is broken down by the responding
macrophages and re-absorbed via the blood stream. Sperm is matured in the
epididymis for about a month once it leaves the testicles. Approximately 50%
of the sperm produced never make it to the orgasmic stage in a non-
vasectomized man. After vasectomy, the membranes increase in size to absorb
and store more fluid; this triggering of the immune system causes more
macrophages to be recruited to break down and re-absorb more of the solid
content. Within one year after a vasectomy, sixty to seventy percent of
vasectomized men develop antisperm antibodies. In some cases, vasitis nodosa,
a benign proliferation of the ductular epithelium, can also result.[7][8] The
buildup of sperm increases pressure in the vas deferens and epididymis. To
prevent damage to the testes, these structures eventually rupture in more than
half the cases.[citation needed] The entry of the sperm into the scrotum
causes sperm granulomas to be formed by the body to contain and absorb the
sperm which the body treats as a foreign substance.[9]

## [edit] Effectiveness

Early failure rates, i.e. pregnancy within a few months after vasectomy, are
below 1%, but the effectiveness of the operation and rates of complications
vary with the level of experience of the surgeon performing the operation and
the surgical technique used.

Although late failure, i.e. pregnancy after recanalization of the vasa
deferentia, is very rare, it has been documented.[10]

## [edit] Prevalence

Worldwide, approximately 6% of married women using contraception rely on
vasectomy.[11]

### [edit] Compared to tubal ligations

The rate of vasectomies compared to tubal ligations worldwide is extremely
variable among countries, and the statistics are mostly based on questionnaire
studies rather than actual counts of procedures performed. Worldwide,
approximately five times as many married women rely on female sterilization as
those relying on male sterilization.[11] In the U.S. about 3 times as many
women at risk for unintended pregnancy rely on tubal ligation as on
vasectomy.[12] In the U.S. tubal ligation is used more frequently than
vasectomy, although the proportions vary from state to state.[13] In Britain,
vasectomy is more popular than tubal ligation, though this statistic may be as
a result of the data-gathering method.[citation needed]

Couples who opt for tubal ligation do so for a number of reasons, including:

  * Convenience of coupling the procedure with giving birth at a hospital.
  * Fear of side effects in the man.
  * Fear of surgery in the man.

Couples who choose vasectomy are motivated by, among other factors:[14]

  * The lower cost of vasectomy
  * The simplicity of the surgical procedure
  * The lower mortality of vasectomy[15] (for example 0.1 per 100,000 vasectomies vs. 4 per 100,000 tubal ligations in industrialized nations)[16]
  * Fear of side effects in the woman
  * Fear of "major" surgery in the woman

## [edit] Complications

Short-term complications include temporary bruising and bleeding, known as
hematoma. The primary long-term complication is a permanent feeling of pain -
Post-Vasectomy Pain Syndrome.

Animal and human data indicate that vasectomy does not increase
atherosclerosis and that increases in circulating immune complexes after
vasectomy are transient. Furthermore, the weight of the evidence regarding
prostate and testicular cancer suggests that men with vasectomy are not at
increased risk of these cancers.[17]

### [edit] Post-Vasectomy Pain Syndrome

Post-Vasectomy Pain Syndrome (PVPS), genital pain of varying intensity that
may last for a lifetime, is estimated to appear in between 5% and 35% of
vasectomized men, depending on the severity of pain that qualifies for the
particular study[18][19][20][21] The pain can be orchialgia, pain with
intercourse, ejaculation, or physical exertion, or tender epididymides.[22] In
one study, vasectomy reversal was found to be 69% effective for reducing the
symptoms of chronic post-vasectomy pain. Treatment options for 31% of patients
whose pain did not respond to vasectomy reversal were limited. The study was
very small, only evaluating 13 patients, making it difficult to draw solid
conclusions.[23] In severe cases castration has been resorted to.[24]

### [edit] Possible Vasectomy-Dementia Link

Researchers reported in February 2007 that a survey of a small number of men
with primary progressive aphasia, a rare speech disorder, found that more than
twice as many as would be expected had undergone vasectomies. Because primary
progressive aphasia is so rare compared to the number of men undergoing
vasectomy it is statistically very unlikely that any one individual would
develop this problem. The study has not yet been verified by other
researchers, and the authors say larger studies are needed to better
understand the issue.[25]

### [edit] Psychological reactions

Some men experience depression or anger and go through a period of mourning
over the loss of their reproductive ability. This emotion is similar to what
some women experience after menopause. Approximately half of all vasectomized
men prefer to keep their sterilization secret. [26] Depending upon the study,
between five and eleven percent of men regret the decision to have a
vasectomy.[27]

## [edit] Reversal

Main article: vasovasostomy

Although men considering vasectomies should not think of them as reversible,
and most men and their spouses are satisfied with the operation, [28][29][30]
there is a procedure to reverse vasectomies using vasovasostomy (a form of
microsurgery first performed by Earl Owen in 1971[31][32]). Vasovasostomy is
effective at achieving pregnancy in only 50%-70% of cases, and it is costly,
with total out-of-pocket costs in the United States of approximately $7,000
[33]. The rate of pregnancy depends on such factors as the method used for the
vasectomy and the length of time that has passed since the vasectomy was
performed. The reversal procedures are frequently impermanent, with occlusion
of the vas recurring two or more years after the operation.

Since the body often produces antibodies against sperm, sperm counts are
rarely at pre-vasectomy levels. There is evidence that men who have had a
vasectomy may produce more abnormal sperm, which would explain why even a
mechanically successful reversal does not always restore fertility.[34][35]
The higher rates of aneuploidy and diploidy in the sperms of men who have
undergone vasectomy reversal may lead to a higher rate of birth defects [36].

In order to allow a possibility of reproduction (via artificial insemination)
after vasectomy, some men opt for cryostorage of sperm before
sterilization.[37]

## [edit] Availability

  * In the UK vasectomy is often available free of charge through the National Health Service upon referral by one's GP. However, some PCTs do not fund the procedure. There are private clinics (such as Marie Stopes International) who perform the operation with short waiting times.

  * The vasectomy is also covered in Canada.

  * In 2006 Argentina approved Vasectomy in Public Health Service[38]
