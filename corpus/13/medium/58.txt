Telepathy (Greek ÏÎ·Î»Îµ, tele meaning "distant" and ÏÎ¬Î¸ÎµÎ¹Î±, patheia
meaning "to be affected by",[2]) describes the purported transfer of
information on thoughts or feelings between individuals by means other than
the five classical senses (See Psi). [1][3] The term was coined in 1882 by the
classical scholar Fredric W. H. Myers, a founder of the Society for Psychical
Research,[1] specifically to replace the earlier expression thought-
transference.[1][3] A person who is able to make use of telepathy is said to
be able to read the minds of others. Telepathy, along with psychokinesis forms
the main branches of parapsychological research, and many studies seeking to
detect and understand telepathy have been done within the field.

Telepathy is a common theme in fiction and science fiction, with many
superheroes and supervillains having telepathic abilities. Such abilities
include sensing the thoughts of others. Some Transhumanists believe that
technologically enabled telepathy, called "techlepathy", will exist in the
future of humanity, and seek to develop practical machines for this.[citation

## [edit] Telepathy in popular culture

### [edit] Literature

Telepathy is commonly used in fiction, with a number of superheroes and
supervillains, as well as figures in many science fiction novels, etc., use
telepathy. Notable fictional telepaths include the Jedi in Star Wars. The
mechanics of telepathy in fiction vary widely. Some fictional telepaths are
limited to receiving only thoughts that are deliberately sent by other
telepaths, or even to receiving thoughts from a specific other person. For
example, in Robert A. Heinlein's 1956 novel Time for the Stars, certain pairs
of twins are able to send telepathic messages to each other. Some telepaths
can read the thoughts only of those they touch, such as Vulcans in the Star
Trek media franchise. At the opposite end of the spectrum, some telepathic
characters continuously sense the thoughts of those around them and may
control or dampen this ability only with difficulty, or not at all, such as in
Scanners. In such cases, telepathy is often portrayed as a mixed blessing or
as a curse.

Some writers view telepathy as the evolutionary destiny of humanity. In Tony
Vigorito's novel, Just a Couple of Days, telepathy emerges across the entire
human species as a result of the Pied Piper Virus, which inadvertently
eliminated humanity's symbolic capacity. In this instance, telepathy is seen
as a latent ability that emerges only when the distractions of language are
bypassed.

Some fictional telepaths possess mind control abilities, which can include
"pushing" thoughts, feelings, or hallucinatory visions into the mind of
another person, causing pain, paralysis, or unconsciousness, altering or
erasing memories, or completely taking over another person's mind and body
(similar to spiritual possession). Examples of this type of telepath include
the Carpathians from the novels in the Dark Series, the White Queen from
Marvel Comics. Characters with this ability may or may not also have the
ability to read thoughts. The Urdu novel "Devta" is based on the character of
Farhad Ali Taimur, a telepath and involves in the fight of good and evil.
Devta is the longest continuously-published novel in history.

Telepathing - same meaning as to telepath, only different verb tense.

Technological Telepathy is also present in science fiction, typically
involving the usage of neural implants of some description. A good example is
the Conjoiners in the Revelation Space series by Alastair Reynolds. Conjoiners
rely on their technological telepathy (referred to by them as
"Transenlightenment") to the extent that they no longer actually speak.
Certain Conjoiners are able to read, attack and control the minds of other
Conjoiners and machines (though not standard humans) using digital attacks,
often having similar effects to other telepaths in fiction.

### [edit] Technologically enabled telepathy

Converging Technologies, a 2002 report exploring the potential for synergy
among nano-, bio-, informational and cognitive technologies (NBIC) for
enhancing human performance.

Some people, occasionally referred to by themselves or others as
"transhumanists", believe that technologically enabled telepathy, coined
"techlepathy", will be the inevitable future of humanity. Kevin Warwick of the
University of Reading, England is one of the leading proponents of this view
and has based all of his recent cybernetics research around developing
practical, safe technology for directly connecting human nervous systems
together with computers and with each other. He believes techno-enabled
telepathy will in the future become the primary form of human communication.
He predicts that this will happen by means of the principle of natural
selection, through which nearly everyone will have the need for such
technology for economic and social reasons.[4][5]

## [edit] Telepathy in parapsychology

Main articles: Scientific investigation of telepathy, Parapsychology, and
Ganzfeld experiment

Within the field of parapsychology, telepathy is considered to be a form of
extra-sensory perception (ESP) or anomalous cognition in which information is
transferred through Psi. It is often categorized similarly to precognition and
clairvoyance.[6] Various experiments have been used to test for telepathic
abilities. Among the most well known are the use of Zener cards and the
Ganzfeld experiment.

Zener cards

Zener cards are cards marked with five distinctive symbols. When using them,
one individual is designated the "sender" and another the "receiver". The
sender must select a random card and visualize the symbol on it, while the
receiver must attempt to determine that symbol using Psi. Statistically, the
receiver has a 20% chance of randomly guessing the correct symbol, so in order
to demonstrate telepathy, they must repeatedly score a success rate that is
significantly higher than 20%.[7] If not conducted properly, this method can
be vulnerable to sensory leakage and card counting. [7]

When using the Ganzfeld experiment to test for telepathy, one individual is
designated the receiver and is placed inside a controlled environment where
they are deprived of sensory input, and another is designated the sender and
is placed in a separate location. The receiver is then required to receive
information from the sender. The exact nature of the information may vary
between experiments.[8]

### [edit] Types of telepathy

Parapsychology describes several different forms of telepathy, including
latent telepathy and precognitive telepathy.[3]

Latent Telepathy, formerly known as "deferred telepathy", [9] is described as
being the transfer of information, through Psi, with an observable time-lag
between transmission and receipt.[3]

Precognitive Telepathy is described as being the transfer of information,
through Psi, about the future state of an individual's mind[3]

Emotive Telepathy, also known as remote influence [10] or emotional transfer,
is the process of transferring kinesthetic sensations through altered states.

Superconscious Telepathy, involves tapping into the superconscious [11] to
access the collective wisdom of the human species for knowledge.

## [edit] Scepticism and controversy

The field which studies certain types of paranormal phenomena such as
telepathy is called parapsychology. There is a consensus among
parapsychologists that some instances of telepathy are real.[12][13] Sceptics
say that instances of apparent telepathy are explained as the result of fraud
or self-delusion and that telepathy does not exist as a paranormal power.[14]

Parapsychologists and sceptics agree that many of the instances of more
popular psychic phenomena, such as mediumism, can be attributed to non-
paranormal techniques such as cold reading.[15][16][17] Magicians such as Ian
Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to
those of popular psychics, but they prefer psychological explanations instead
of paranormal ones. They have identified, described, and developed complex
psychological techniques of cold reading and hot reading.

A technique which shows statistically significant evidence of telepathy on
every occasion has yet to be discovered. This lack of reliable reproducibility
has led sceptics to argue that there is no credible scientific evidence for
the existence of telepathy at all.[18] Sceptics also point to historical cases
in which were discovered flaws in experimental design and occasional cases of
fraud.[18] Parapsychologists such as Dean Radin, president of the
Parapsychological Association, argue that the statistical significance and
consistency of results shown by a meta-analysis of numerous studies provides
evidence for telepathy that is almost impossible to account for using any
other means.[8]

## [edit] Origins of the concept

According to Roger Luckhurst [19], the origin of the concept of telepathy (not
telepathy itself) in the Western civilization can be tracked to the late 19th
century. Prior to this period, science focused on physical phenomena and did
not frequently concern itself with "the mind." As the physical sciences made
significant advances, scientific concepts were applied to real or imagined
mental phenomena (e.g., animal magnetism), with the hope that this would help
understand paranormal phenomena. The concept of telepathy emerged in this
historical context.

In addition, the notion of telepathy is similar to two psychological concepts:
delusions of thought insertion/removal and psychological symbiosis. This
similarity might explain how some people have come up with the idea of
telephathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly
of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Psychiatric patients who
experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not
their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, or conspiring
intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought
insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their
minds or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis,
delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication.
Psychological symbiosis is a less well established concept. It is an idea
found in the writings of early psychoanalysts, such as Melanie Klein. It
entails the belief that in the early psychological experience of the child
(during earliest infancy), the child is unable to tell the difference between
his or her own mind, on one hand, and his or her experience of the
mother/parent, on the other hand. This state of mind is called psychological
symbiosis; with development, it ends, but, purportedly, aspects of it can
still be detected in the psychological functioning of the adult. Putatively,
the experience of either thought insertion/removal or unconscious memories of
psychological symbiosis may have led to the invention of "telepathy" as a
notion and the belief that telepathy exists. Psychiatrists and clinical
psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with
schizotypal personality disorder are particularly likely to believe in
telepathy [20].
