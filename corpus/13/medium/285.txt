A night terror, also known as pavor nocturnus, is a parasomnia disorder
characterized by extreme terror and a temporary inability to regain full
consciousness. The subject wakes abruptly from slow-wave sleep, with waking
usually accompanied by gasping, moaning, or screaming. It is often impossible
to fully awaken the person, and after the episode the subject normally settles
back to sleep without waking. A night terror can rarely be recalled by the
subject. They typically occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep.

## [edit] Comparison to nightmares

Night terrors are distinct from nightmares in several key ways. First, the
subject is not fully asleep when the night terror occurs. Unlike nightmares,
which are frequently dreams of a frightening nature, night terrors are not
recalled dreams. Usually there is no situation or event (scary or otherwise)
that is dreamed, but rather the emotion of fear itself is felt. Often, this is
coupled with tension and apprehension without any distinct sounds or visual
imagery, although sometimes a vague object of fear is identified by the
sufferer. These emotions, generally without a focusing event or scenario,
increase emotions in a cumulative effect. The night terrors can often be
recalled by children as they get older. In some cases, the triggering emotion
remains over time until they can nearly fully recall what it is that caused
their hysteria. An example of this emotional trigger could be having to
perform an impossible task (counting stars, counting the texture of dried
paint, etc...) or an image of some sort such as the folds of a human brain.
The lack of a dream itself leaves those awakened from a night terror in a
state of disorientation much more severe than that caused by a normal
nightmare. This can include a short period of amnesia during which the
subjects may be unable to recall their names, locations, ages, or any other
identifying features of themselves.

## [edit] In children

Children from age two to six are most prone to night terrors, and they affect
about fifteen percent of all children,[1] although people of any age may
experience them. Episodes may recur for a couple of weeks then suddenly
disappear.[citation needed] The symptoms also tend to be different, like the
child being able to recall the experience, and while nearly arisen,
hallucinate.[citation needed] Strong evidence has shown that a predisposition
to night terrors and other parasomniac disorders can be passed
genetically.[citation needed] Though there are a multitude of triggers,
emotional stress during the previous day and a high fever are thought to
precipitate most episodes.[citation needed] Ensuring the right amount of sleep
is an important factor. Night terrors may also be caused by constipation and
other irregular bowel movements or lack thereof.[citation needed] Special
consideration must be used when the subject suffers from narcolepsy, as there
may be a link.[citation needed]

## [edit] In adults

Though the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar,
the etiology, prognosis and treatment are qualitatively different. These night
terrors can occur each night if the sufferer does not eat a proper diet, get
the appropriate amount of sleep, is enduring stressful events in his/her life
or if he/she remains untreated. Adult night terrors are much less common,
often trauma-based rather than genetic, chronic, and often respond to
treatment in the form of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. There is
some evidence of a link between adult night terrors and hypoglycemia.[citation
needed]

In addition to night terrors, some adult night terror sufferers have many of
the characteristics of abused and depressed individuals including inhibition
of aggression,[2] self-directed anger,[2] passivity,[3] anxiety, impaired
memory,[4], and the ability to ignore pain.[5].
