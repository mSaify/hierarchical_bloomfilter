Web usability is the application of usability in those domains where web
browsing can be considered as a general paradigm (or "metaphor") for
constructing a GUI.

## [edit] General

Web usability is an approach to make web sites easy to use for an end-user,
without requiring her (or him) to undergo any specialized training.[citation
needed] The user should be able to intuitively relate the actions he needs to
perform on the web page, with other interactions he sees in the general domain
of life e.g. press of a button leads to some action. The broad goal of
usability can be:[citation needed]

  1. Present the information to the user in a clear and concise way.
  2. To give the correct choices to the users, in a very obvious way.
  3. To remove any ambiguity regarding the consequences of an action e.g. clicking on delete/remove/purchase.
  4. Put the most important thing in the right place on a web page or a web application.

## [edit] Methodology

As more results of usability research become available, this leads to the
development of methodologies for enhancing web-usability.

## [edit] eCommerce

In the context of eCommerce websites, the meaning of web-usability is narrowed
down to efficiency: triggering sales and/or performing other transactions
valuable to the business.

Web usability received renewed attention as many early eCommerce websites
started failing in 2000. Whereas fancy graphical design had been regarded as
indispensable for a successful e-business application during the emergence of
internet in the 1990s, web-usability protagonists said quite the reverse was
true. They advocated the KISS principle, which had proven to be effective in
focusing end-user attention.
