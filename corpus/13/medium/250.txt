Glutamine (abbreviated as Gln or Q; the abbreviation Glx or Z represents
either glutamine or glutamic acid) is one of the 20 amino acids encoded by the
standard genetic code. Its side chain is an amide formed by replacing the
side-chain hydroxyl of glutamic acid with an amine functional group. It can
therefore be considered the amide of glutamic acid. Its codons are CAA and
CAG. Recent studies have proven its effectiveness in anabolic muscle growth
from prolonged consumption.[citation needed]

### [edit] Occurrences in nature

Glutamine is the most abundant naturally occurring, non-essential amino acid
in the human body and one of the only amino acids which directly crosses the
blood-brain barrier.[1] In the body it is found circulating in the blood as
well as stored in the skeletal muscles. It becomes conditionally essential
(requiring intake from food or supplements) in states of illness or injury.

#### [edit] Dietary sources

Dietary sources of L-glutamine include beef, chicken, fish, eggs, milk, dairy
products, wheat, cabbage, beets, beans, spinach, and parsley. Small amounts of
free L-glutamine are also found in vegetable juices and fermented foods, such
as miso.[2]

### [edit] Functions

Glutamine has a variety of biochemical functions including:

  1. A substrate for DNA synthesis
  2. Major role in protein synthesis
  3. Primary source of fuel for enterocytes (cells lining the inside of the small intestine)
  4. Precursor for rapidly dividing immune cells, thus aiding in immune function
  5. Regulation of acid-base balance in the kidney by producing ammonium[3]
  6. Alternative source of fuel for the brain and helps to block cortisol-induced protein catabolism
  7. As a form of fixed nitrogen by heterocysts, exchanged for photosynthate from undifferentiated cyanobacterial cells

### [edit] Use

It is normal in nutritional tablet form to take as a suppository to increase
its effects as most of the amino acids are absorbed in the lower stomach. In
catabolic states of injury and illness, GLN becomes conditionally-essential
(requiring intake from food or supplements). Glutamine has been studied
extensively over the past 10â15 years and has been shown to be useful in
treatment of serious illnesses, injury, trauma, burns, cancer and its
treatment related side-effects as well as in wound healing for postoperative
patients.[4][unreliable source?] That is why it is now also classified as a
nutraceutical. Glutamine is also marketed as a supplement used for muscle
growth in weightlifting, bodybuilding, endurance and other sports.[5]

Glutamine has also been taken to enhance brain function as it fuels two of the
brain's most important neurotransmitters: glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA). It also assists in nitrogen transportation and reduces toxic
build up of ammonia in the brain (though is contra-indicated for those with
Reye's Syndrome). Hence, it has been used to aid memory, increase IQ in those
with mental retardation, and to support people with schizophrenia and
senility.[6]

It has also been used in the treatment of ADHD, anxiety.[7][unreliable
source?] and depression.[8][9]

It has also been used in recovery programs to break sugar craving cycles in
alcoholics (although is contra-indicated for those with cirrhosis of the liver
or kidney disease) and assist diabetics in the management of sugar
cravings.[6][10]

It is also used as an anti-inflammatory in the treatment of autoimmune
diseases and preserves Glutathione (important for detoxification and immune
support) levels in the liver.[10]

Glutamine is contraindicated for those with Reye's syndrome, cirrhosis of the
liver and kidney disease.[11][unreliable source?]

### [edit] Aiding gastrointestinal function

<IMG> This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.  
In recent studies, glutamine-enriched diets have been linked with intestinal
effects including maintenance of gut barrier function, and cell
differentiation. This may relate to the fact that the intestinal extraction
rate of glutamine is higher than that for other amino acids, and is therefore
thought to be the most viable option when attempting to alleviate conditions
relating to the gastrointestinal tract. These conditions were discovered after
comparing plasma concentration within the gut between glutamine-enriched and
non glutamine-enriched diets. However, even though glutamine is thought to
have "cleansing" properties and effects, it is unknown to what extent
glutamine has clinical benefits, due to the varied concentrations of glutamine
in varieties of food.

### [edit] Aiding recovery after surgery

It is also known that glutamine has various effects in reducing healing time
after operations. Hospital-stay times after abdominal surgery can be reduced
by providing parenteral nutrition regimes containing high amounts of glutamine
to patients. Clinical trials have revealed that patients on supplementation
regimes containing glutamine have improved nitrogen balances, generation of
cysteinyl-leukotrienes from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and
improved lymphocyte recovery and intestinal permeability (in postoperative
patients) - in comparison to those who had no glutamine within their dietary
regime; all without any side-effects.[12]
