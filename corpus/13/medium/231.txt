This article is about the dietary recommendation that became popular in the
1990s. For food of the areas around the Mediterranean Sea, see Cuisine of the
Mediterranean.

The Mediterranean diet is a modern[1] nutritional recommendation inspired by
the traditional dietary patterns of some of the countries of the Mediterranean
Basin.

## [edit] History

The most commonly-understood version of the Mediterranean diet was presented
by Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard University's School of Public Health in the
mid-1990s.[2] Based on "food patterns typical of Crete, much of the rest of
Greece, and southern Italy in the early 1960s", this diet, in addition to
"regular physical activity," emphasizes "abundant plant foods, fresh fruit as
the typical daily dessert, olive oil as the principal source of fat, dairy
products (principally cheese and yogurt), and fish and poultry consumed in low
to moderate amounts, zero to four eggs consumed weekly, red meat consumed in
low amounts, and wine consumed in low to moderate amounts". Total fat in this
diet is 25% to 35% of calories, with saturated fat at 8% or less of
calories.[3] The diet is often cited as beneficial for being low in saturated
fat and high in monounsaturated fat and dietary fiber.[citation needed]

Although it was first publicized in 1945 by the American doctor Ancel Keys
stationed in Salerno, Italy, the Mediterranean diet failed to gain widespread
recognition until the 1990s. It is based on what from the point of view of
mainstream nutrition is considered a paradox: that although the people living
in Mediterranean countries tend to consume relatively high amounts of fat,
they have far lower rates of cardiovascular disease than in countries like the
United States, where similar levels of fat consumption are found. A parallel
phenomenon is known as the French Paradox.[4]

One of the main explanations is thought to be the large amount of olive oil
used in the Mediterranean diet. Unlike the high amount of animal fats typical
to the American diet, olive oil lowers cholesterol levels in the blood.[5] It
is also known to lower blood sugar levels and blood pressure.[citation needed]
Research indicates olive oil prevents peptic ulcers and is effective in
treatment of peptic ulcer disease,[6] and may be a factor in preventing
cancer.[7] In addition, the consumption of red wine is considered a possible
factor, as it contains flavonoids with powerful antioxidant properties[8].

The principal aspects of this diet include high olive oil consumption, high
consumption of legumes, high consumption of unrefined cereals, high
consumption of fruits, high consumption of vegetables, moderate consumption of
dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate to high consumption of
fish, low consumption of meat and meat products, and moderate wine
consumption[9].

Michael Pollan suggests the explanation is not any particular nutrient, but
the combination of nutrients found in unprocessed food.[10]

Dietary factors may be only part of the reason for the health benefits enjoyed
by these cultures. Genetics, lifestyle (notably heavy physical labor), and
environment may also be involved.[citation needed]

Although green vegetables, a good source of calcium and iron, as well as goat
cheese, a good source of calcium, are common in the Mediterranean diet,
concerns remain whether the diet provides adequate amounts of all nutrients,
particularly calcium and iron.[citation needed]

This diet is not typical of all Mediterranean cuisine. In Northern Italy, for
instance, lard and butter are commonly used in cooking, and olive oil is
reserved for dressing salads and cooked vegetables.[11] In North Africa wine
is traditionally avoided by Muslims. In both North Africa and the Levant,
along with olive oil, sheep's tail fat and rendered butter (samna) are
traditional staple fats.[12]

The putative benefits of the Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular health are
primarily correlative in nature; while they reflect a very real disparity in
the geographic incidence of heart disease, identifying the causal determinant
of this disparity has proven difficult. The most popular dietary candidate,
olive oil, has been undermined by a body of experimental evidence that diets
enriched in monounsaturated fats such as olive oil are not atheroprotective
when compared to diets enriched in either polyunsaturated or even saturated
fats. [13] [14] A recently emerging alternative hypothesis to the
Mediterranean diet is that differential exposure to solar ultraviolet
radiation accounts for the disparity in cardiovascular health between
residents of Mediterranean and more northerly countries. The proposed
mechanism is solar UVB-induced synthesis of Vitamin D in the oils of the skin,
which has been observed to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, and
which rapidly diminishes with increasing latitude. [15]

## [edit] Medical research

The Seven Countries Study[16] found that Cretan men had exceptionally low
death rates from heart disease, despite moderate to high intake of fat. The
Cretan diet is similar to other traditional Mediterranean diets, consisting
mostly of olive oil, bread, abundant fruit and vegetables, fish, and a
moderate amount of dairy foods and wine.

The Lyon Diet Heart Study[17] set out to mimic the Cretan diet, but adopted a
pragmatic approach. Realizing that some of the people in the study (all of
whom had survived a first heart attack) would be reluctant to move from butter
to olive oil, they used a margarine based on rapeseed (canola) oil. The
dietary change also included 20% increases in vitamin C rich fruit and bread
and decreases in processed and red meat. On this diet, mortality from all
causes was reduced by 70%. This study was so successful that the ethics
committee decided to stop the study prematurely so that the results of the
study could be made available to the public immediately.[18]

According to a study published in the British Medical Journal (May 29, 2008),
the traditional Mediterranean diet provides substantial protection against
type 2 diabetes.[19] The study involved over 13 000 graduates from the
University of Navarra in Spain with no history of diabetes, who were recruited
between December 1999 and November 2007, and whose dietary habits and health
were subsequently tracked. Participants initially completed a 136-item food
frequency questionnaire designed to measure the entire diet. The questionnaire
also included questions on the use of fats and oils, cooking methods and
dietary supplements. Every two years participants were sent follow-up
questionnaires on diet, lifestyle, risk factors, and medical conditions. New
cases of diabetes were confirmed through medical reports. During the follow-up
period (median 4.4 years) the researchers from the University of Navarra found
that participants who stuck closely to the diet had a lower risk of diabetes.
A high adherence to the diet was associated with an 83% relative reduction in
the risk of developing diabetes.[20]

A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (July 17, 2008)
examined the effects of three diets: low-carb, low-fat, and Mediterranean. The
study involved 322 participants and lasted for 2 years. The low-carb and
Mediterranean diet resulted in the greatest weight loss, 12 lbs and 10 lbs,
respectively. The low-fat diet resulted in a loss of 7 lbs. One caveat of the
study is that 86% of the study participants were men. The low-carb and
Mediterranean diets produced similar amounts of weight loss in the overall
study results and in the men. In the remaining participants who were women,
the Mediterranean diet produced 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs) more weight loss on average
than the low-carb diet.[21]

A meta-analysis published in the British Medical Journal (September 12, 2008)
showed that following strictly the Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of
dying from cancer and cardiovascular disease as well as the risk of developing
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The results report 9%, 9%, and 6%
reduction in overall, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality respectively.
Additionally a 13% reduction in incidence of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
diseases is to be expected provided strict adherence to the diet is
observed.[22]
