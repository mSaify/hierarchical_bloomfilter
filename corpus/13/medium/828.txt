Reconstructionist Judaism is a modern American-based Jewish movement based on
the ideas of the late Mordecai Kaplan (1881 â 1983). The movement views
Judaism as a progressively evolving civilization.[1] It originated as the
radical left branch of Conservative Judaism before it splintered. The movement
developed from the late 1920s to 1940s, and it established a rabbinical
college in 1968.

There is substantial theological diversity within the movement. Halakha is not
considered binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should
be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary. The movement emphasizes
positive views towards modernism, and has an approach to Jewish custom which
aims toward communal decision making through a process of education and
distillation of values from traditional Jewish sources.

## [edit] Origin

Reconstructionism was developed by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881â1983) and his
son-in-law, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein (1906â2001) over a period of time spanning
from the late 1920s to the 1940s. It made its greatest stride in becoming the
fourth movement in North American Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative and Reform
being the other three) with the founding of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical
College in 1968.

Reconstructionist Judaism is the first major movement of Judaism to originate
in North America; the second is the Humanistic Judaism movement founded in
1963 by Rabbi Sherwin Wine.

## [edit] Theology

Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan believed that in light of advances in philosophy,
science and history as they existed in the 1930s and 1940s, it would be
impossible for modern Jews to continue to adhere to many of Judaism's
traditional theological claims. Kaplan's naturalism theology has been seen as
a variant of John Dewey's philosophy. Dewey's naturalism combined atheist
beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a religiously
satisfying philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional religion.

Kaplan affirmed that God is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic
descriptions of God are, at best, imperfect metaphors. Kaplan's theology went
beyond this to claim that God is the sum of all natural processes that allow
man to become self-fulfilled. Kaplan wrote that "to believe in God means to
take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to
eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society."

Not all of Kaplan's writings on the subject were consistent; his position
evolved somewhat over the years, and two distinct theologies can be discerned
with a careful reading. The view more popularly associated with Kaplan is
strict naturalism, Ã la Dewey, which has been criticized as using religious
terminology to mask a non-theistic, if not outright atheistic, position.
However, a second strand of Kaplanian theology exists, which makes clear that
at times Kaplan believed that God has ontological reality, a real and absolute
existence independent of human beliefs. In this latter theology, Kaplan still
rejects classical forms of theism and any belief in miracles, but holds to a
position that in some ways is neo-Platonic.

Most "Classical" Reconstructionist Jews [those following Kaplan] reject
traditional forms of theism, though this is by no means universal. Many are
deists; a small number accept Kabbalistic views of God, or the concept of a
personal God.

Though many of Kaplan's followers found his ideas about God compelling,
Kaplan's theology, as he explicitly stated, does not represent the only
Reconstructionist understanding of theology. Theology is not the cornerstone
of the Reconstructionist movement. Much more central is the idea that Judaism
is a civilization, and that the Jewish people must take an active role in
ensuring its future by participating in its ongoing evolution.

Consequently, a strain of Reconstructionism exists which is distinctly non-
Kaplanian. In this view, Kaplan's assertions concerning belief and practice
are largely rejected, while the tenets of an "evolving religious civilization"
are supported. The basis for this approach is that Kaplan spoke for his
generation: he also wrote that every generation would need to define itself
and its civilization for itself. In the thinking of these Reconstructionists,
what Kaplan said concerning belief and practice is not applicable today. This
approach may include a belief in a personal God, acceptance of the concept of
"chosenness", a belief in some form of "resurrection" or continued existence
of the dead, and the existence of an obligatory form of halakha. In the
latter, in particular, there has developed a broader concept of "Halakhah"
wherein concepts such as "eco-Kashrut" are incorporated.

Beliefs and practices  
v â¢ d â¢ e  
As in Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism holds that contemporary
Western secular morality has precedence over Jewish law and theology. It does
not ask that its adherents hold to any particular beliefs, nor does it ask
that Jewish law be accepted as normative. Unlike classical Reform Judaism,
Reconstructionism holds that a person's default position should be to
incorporate Jewish laws and tradition into their lives, unless they have a
specific reason to do otherwise. The most important distinction between
Reconstructionist Judaism and traditional Judaism is that Reconstructionism
feels that all of halakha should be categorized as "folkways", and not as law.

Reconstructionism promotes many traditional Jewish practices, while holding
that contemporary Western secular morality has precedence over Jewish law.
Thus, mitzvot (commandments) have been replaced with "folkways", non-binding
customs that can be democratically accepted or rejected by the congregations.
Folkways that are promoted include keeping Hebrew in the prayer service,
studying Torah, daily prayer, wearing kipot (yarmulkas), tallitot and tefillin
during prayer, and observance of the Jewish holidays.

## [edit] Principles of belief

In practice, Rabbi Kaplan's books, especially The Meaning of God in Modern
Jewish Religion and Judaism as a Civilization are de facto statements of
principles. In 1986, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) and
the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH) passed
the official Platform on Reconstructionism (2 pages). It is not a mandatory
statement of principles, but rather a consensus of current beliefs. [See the
FRCH Newsletter, Sept. 1986, pages D, E.] Major points of the platform state
that:

    "Judaism is the result of natural human development. There is no such thing as divine intervention; Judaism is an evolving religious civilization; Zionism and aliyah (immigration to Israel) are encouraged; Reconstructionist Judaism is based on a democratic community where the laity can make decisions, not just rabbis; The Torah was not inspired by God; it only comes from the social and historical development of Jewish people; The classical view of God is rejected. God is redefined as the sum of natural powers or processes that allows mankind to gain self-fulfillment and moral improvement; The idea that God chose the Jewish people for any purpose, in any way, is "morally untenable", because anyone who has such beliefs "implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others".
Most Reconstructionists do not believe in revelation (the idea that God can
reveal God's will to human beings). This is dismissed as supernaturalism.
Kaplan posits that revelation "consists in disengaging from the traditional
context those elements in it which answer permanent postulates of human
nature, and in integrating them into our own ideology ... the rest may be
relegated to archaeology." (The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion).

Many writers have criticized the movement's most widely held theology,
religious naturalism. David Ray Griffin and Louis Jacobs have objected to the
redefinitions of the terms "revelation" and "God" as being intellectually
dishonest, and as being a form of "conversion by definition"; in their
critique, these redefinitions take non-theistic beliefs and attach theistic
terms to them.

Similar critiques have been put forth by Rabbis Neil Gillman (Sacred
Fragments, p.200); Milton Steinberg (Milton Steinberg: Portrait of a Rabbi) by
Simon Noveck, Ktav, 1978, p.259-260; and Michael Samuels (The Lord is My
Shepherd: The Theology of a Caring God 1996).

Reconstructionist Judaism is egalitarian with respect to gender roles. All
positions are open to both genders; they are open to lesbians and gay men as
well.

## [edit] Jewish identity

Reconstructionist Judaism allows its rabbis to determine their own policy
regarding officiation at intermarriages. Some congregations accept patrilineal
descent as well as matrilineal, i.e., children of one Jewish parent, of either
sex, are considered Jewish if raised as Jews. This is less restrictive than
the traditional standard that only considers children with Jewish mothers to
be Jewish, regardless of how they were raised.

The role of non-Jews in Reconstructionist congregations is a matter of ongoing
debate. Practices vary widely between synagogues. Most congregations strive to
strike a balance between inclusivity and integrity of boundaries. The Jewish
Reconstructionist Federation (JRF) has issued a non-binding statement
attempting to delineate the process by which congregations set policy on these
issues, and sets forth sample recommendations. These issues are ultimately
decided by local lay leadership. [Can Halakha Live? by Rabbi Edward Feld, The
Reconstructionist, Vol.59(2), Fall 1994, p.64-72]

## [edit] Reconstructionist organizations

Over 100 synagogues and havurot, mostly in the United States and Canada, are
affiliated with the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation. The Reconstructionist
Rabbinical College educates rabbis and cantors. The Reconstructionist
Rabbinical Association is the professional organization of Reconstructionist
rabbis.  

## [edit] Relation to other Jewish movements

Originally an offshoot of Conservative Judaism/Masorti Judaism,
Reconstructionism retains warm relations with both the Conservative/Masorti
movement and Reform Judaism. Orthodox Judaism, however, considers
Reconstructionism to be heretical.[2] The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation
is a member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism.[1]
