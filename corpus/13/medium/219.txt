### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

Theism in the broadest sense is the belief in at least one deity.[1][2] In a
specific sense in current usage, theism generally refers to a particular
doctrine concerning the nature of God and his relationship to the universe.[3]
Theism, in this specific sense, conceives of God as personal and active in the
governance and organization of the world and the universe. The use of the word
theism as indicating a particular doctrine of monotheism arose in the wake of
the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century to contrast with the then
emerging deism which contended that God â though transcendent and supreme
â did not intervene in the natural world and could be known rationally but
not via revelation.[4]

The term "theism" derives from the Greek theos meaning God. The term theism
was first used by Ralph Cudworth (1617â1688).[5]

## [edit] Theisms

### [edit] Monotheism

Monotheism is the belief that there is only one deity. [6]

  * Inclusive monotheism: The belief that there is only one deity, and that all other claimed deities are just different names for it. The Hindu denomination of Smartism is an example of inclusive monotheism.
  * Exclusive monotheism: The belief that there is only one deity, and that all other claimed deities are distinct from it and false â either invented, demonic, or simply incorrect. Most Abrahamic religions, and certain versions of the Hindu denomination of Vaishnavism, such as ISKCON which regard the worship of anyone other than Vishnu as incorrect are examples of exclusive monotheism.

Three religions are sometimes cited as the earliest known forms of monotheism
still in practice today: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and pre-Vedic
Brahmanism,[citation needed] though originally all could have been described
as henotheistic. Monotheism is sometimes sourced to the Egyptian religion of
Atenism, which is no longer widely practiced.

### [edit] Polytheism

While a specific definition of theism may exclude polytheism, it is included
by the most general definition. Polytheism is the belief that there is more
than one deity.[7] In practice, polytheism is not just the belief that there
are multiple gods; it usually includes belief in the existence of a specific
pantheon of distinct deities.

Within polytheism there are hard and soft varieties:

  * Hard polytheism views the gods as being distinct and separate beings; an example of this would be ancient Greek Mythology.
  * Soft polytheism views the gods as being subsumed into a greater whole. Most forms of Hinduism serve as examples of soft polytheism.

Polytheism is also divided according to how the individual deities are
regarded:

  * Henotheism: The viewpoint/belief that there may be more than one deity, but one is supreme.
  * Kathenotheism: The viewpoint/belief that there is more than one deity, but only one deity is worshipped at a time or ever, and another may be worthy of worship at another time or place. If they are worshipped one at a time, then each is supreme in turn.
  * Monolatrism: The belief that there may be more than one deity, but that only one is worthy of being worshipped.

### [edit] Pantheism and Panentheism

While a specific definition of theism may exclude pantheism, it is included by
the most general definition.

  * Pantheism: The belief that the physical universe is equivalent to a God or Gods, and that there is no division between a Creator and the substance of its creation.[8]
  * Panentheism: Like Pantheism, the belief that the physical universe is joined to a God or Gods. However, it also believes that a God or Gods are greater than the material universe.

Some philosophers find the distinction between pantheism and panentheism to be
ambiguous.[citation needed]

### [edit] Deism

While a specific definition of theism may exclude deism, it is included by the
most general definition.

  * Deism is the belief that a god or gods exists, created the world, but does/do not alter the original plan for the universe.[9] It typically rejects supernatural events (prophecy, miracles) and divine revelation prominent in organized religion, along with holy books and revealed religions that assert the existence of such things. Instead, Deism holds that religious beliefs must be founded on human reason and observed features of the natural world, and that these sources reveal the existence of a supreme being as creator.[10]
    * Pandeism: The belief that God preceded the universe and created it, but is now equivalent with it.
    * Panendeism combines deism with panentheism, believing the universe is a part (but not the whole) of deity
    * Polydeism: The belief that multiple gods existed, but do not intervene with the universe.

### [edit] Autotheism

While a specific definition of theism may exclude autotheism, it is included
by the most general definition. Autotheism is the viewpoint that, whether
divinity is also external or not, it is inherently within 'oneself' and that
one's duty is to become perfect; divine. This can either be in a selfish,
wilful, egotistical way or a selfless way following the implications of Jesus
Christ's statements and canon, outright suggestions made by him,[vague]
Buddha, and other ethical philosophy/religion founders.[citation needed]

### [edit] Value-judgment theisms

  * Eutheism is the viewpoint/belief God/gods are benevolent; misotheism is the opposite.
