A top-down view of skeletal muscle

Muscle (from Latin musculus, diminutive of mus "mouse"[1]) is the contractile
tissue of the body and is derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ
cells. Muscle cells contain contractile filaments that move past each other
and change the size of the cell. They are classified as skeletal, cardiac, or
smooth muscles. Their function is to produce force and cause motion. Muscles
can cause either locomotion of the organism itself or movement of internal
organs. Cardiac and smooth muscle contraction occurs without conscious thought
and is necessary for survival. Examples are the contraction of the heart and
peristalsis which pushes food through the digestive system. Voluntary
contraction of the skeletal muscles is used to move the body and can be finely
controlled. Examples are movements of the eye, or gross movements like the
quadriceps muscle of the thigh. There are two broad types of voluntary muscle
fibers: slow twitch and fast twitch. Slow twitch fibers contract for long
periods of time but with little force while fast twitch fibers contract
quickly and powerfully but fatigue very rapidly.

Types of muscle

There are three types of muscle:

  * Skeletal muscle or "voluntary muscle" is anchored by tendons to bone and is used to effect skeletal movement such as locomotion and in maintaining posture. Though this postural control is generally maintained as a subconscious reflex, the muscles responsible react to conscious control like non-postural muscles. An average adult male is made up of 40â50% of skeletal muscle and an average adult female is made up of 30â40% (as a percentage of body mass).[citation needed]
  * Smooth muscle or "involuntary muscle" is found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, bronchi, uterus, urethra, bladder, blood vessels, and even the skin (in which it controls erection of body hair). Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle is not under conscious control.
  * Cardiac muscle is also an "involuntary muscle" but is more akin in structure to skeletal muscle, and is found only in the heart.

Cardiac and skeletal muscles are "striated" in that they contain sarcomeres
and are packed into highly-regular arrangements of bundles; smooth muscle has
neither. While skeletal muscles are arranged in regular, parallel bundles,
cardiac muscle connects at branching, irregular angles (called intercalated
discs). Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts,
whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions.

Skeletal muscle is further divided into several subtypes:

  * Type I, slow oxidative, slow twitch, or "red" muscle is dense with capillaries and is rich in mitochondria and myoglobin, giving the muscle tissue its characteristic red color. It can carry more oxygen and sustain aerobic activity.
  * Type II, fast twitch muscle, has three major kinds that are, in order of increasing contractile speed:[2]
    * Type IIa, which, like slow muscle, is aerobic, rich in mitochondria and capillaries and appears red.
    * Type IIx (also known as type IId), which is less dense in mitochondria and myoglobin. This is the fastest muscle type in humans. It can contract more quickly and with a greater amount of force than oxidative muscle, but can sustain only short, anaerobic bursts of activity before muscle contraction becomes painful (often incorrectly attributed to a build-up of lactic acid). N.B. in some books and articles this muscle in humans was, confusingly, called type IIB.[3]
    * Type IIb, which is anaerobic, glycolytic, "white" muscle that is even less dense in mitochondria and myoglobin. In small animals like rodents this is the major fast muscle type, explaining the pale color of their flesh.

## Anatomy

The anatomy of muscles includes both gross anatomy, comprising all the muscles
of an organism, and, on the other hand, microanatomy, which comprises the
structures of a single muscle.

### Gross anatomy

Muscles, posterior view (See Gray's muscle pictures for detailed pictures)

The gross anatomy of a muscle is the most important indicator of its role in
the body. The action a muscle generates is determined by the origin and
insertion locations. The cross-sectional area of a muscle (rather than volume
or length) determines the amount of force it can generate by defining the
number of sarcomeres which can operate in parallel. The amount of force
applied to the external environment is determined by lever mechanics,
specifically the ratio of in-lever to out-lever. For example, moving the
insertion point of the biceps more distally on the radius (farther from the
joint of rotation) would increase the force generated during flexion (and, as
a result, the maximum weight lifted in this movement), but decrease the
maximum speed of flexion. Moving the insertion point proximally (closer to the
joint of rotation) would result in decreased force but increased velocity.
This can be most easily seen by comparing the limb of a mole to a horse - in
the former, the insertion point is positioned to maximize force (for digging),
while in the latter, the insertion point is positioned to maximize speed (for
running).

One particularly important aspect of gross anatomy of muscles is pennation or
lack thereof. In most muscles, all the fibers are oriented in the same
direction, running in a line from the origin to the insertion. In pennate
muscles, the individual fibers are oriented at an angle relative to the line
of action, attaching to the origin and insertion tendons at each end. Because
the contracting fibers are pulling at an angle to the overall action of the
muscle, the change in length is smaller, but this same orientation allows for
more fibers (thus more force) in a muscle of a given size. Pennate muscles are
usually found where their length change is less important than maximum force,
such as the rectus femoris.

There are approximately 639 skeletal muscles in the human body. However, the
exact number is difficult to define because different sources group muscles
differently.

Main article: Table of muscles of the human body

### Microanatomy

Muscle is mainly composed of muscle cells. Within the cells are myofibrils;
myofibrils contain sarcomeres, which are composed of actin and myosin.
Individual muscle fibres are surrounded by endomysium. Muscle fibers are bound
together by perimysium into bundles called fascicles; the bundles are then
grouped together to form muscle, which is enclosed in a sheath of epimysium.
Muscle spindles are distributed throughout the muscles and provide sensory
feedback information to the central nervous system.

Skeletal muscle is arranged in discrete muscles, an example of which is the
biceps brachii. It is connected by tendons to processes of the skeleton.
Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle in both composition and action,
being comprised of myofibrils of sarcomeres, but anatomically different in
that the muscle fibers are typically branched like a tree and connect to other
cardiac muscle fibers through intercalcated discs, and form the appearance of
a syncytium.

## Physiology

Main article: muscle contraction

The three (skeletal, cardiac and smooth) types of muscle have significant
differences. However, all three use the movement of actin against myosin to
create contraction. In skeletal muscle, contraction is stimulated by
electrical impulses transmitted by the nerves, the motor nerves and
motoneurons in particular. Cardiac and smooth muscle contractions are
stimulated by internal pacemaker cells which regularly contract, and propagate
contractions to other muscle cells they are in contact with. All skeletal
muscle and many smooth muscle contractions are facilitated by the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

Muscular activity accounts for much of the body's energy consumption. All
muscle cells produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules which are used to
power the movement of the myosin heads. Muscles conserve energy in the form of
creatine phosphate which is generated from ATP and can regenerate ATP when
needed with creatine kinase. Muscles also keep a storage form of glucose in
the form of glycogen. Glycogen can be rapidly converted to glucose when energy
is required for sustained, powerful contractions. Within the voluntary
skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a
process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules
in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed;
instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle).
Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during
aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP
and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps, but
produces significantly more ATP than anaerobic glycolysis. Cardiac muscle on
the other hand, can readily consume any of the three macronutrients (protein,
glucose and fat) aerobically without a 'warm up' period and always extracts
the maximum ATP yield from any molecule involved. The heart, liver and red
blood cells will also consume lactic acid produced and excreted by skeletal
muscles during exercise.

### Efferent leg

The efferent leg of the peripheral nervous system is responsible for conveying
commands to the muscles and glands, and is ultimately responsible for
voluntary movement. Nerves move muscles in response to voluntary and autonomic
(involuntary) signals from the brain. Deep muscles, superficial muscles,
muscles of the face and internal muscles all correspond with dedicated regions
in the primary motor cortex of the brain, directly anterior to the central
sulcus that divides the frontal and parietal lobes.

In addition, muscles react to reflexive nerve stimuli that do not always send
signals all the way to the brain. In this case, the signal from the afferent
fiber does not reach the brain, but produces the reflexive movement by direct
connections with the efferent nerves in the spine. However, the majority of
muscle activity is volitional, and the result of complex interactions between
various areas of the brain.

Nerves that control skeletal muscles in mammals correspond with neuron groups
along the primary motor cortex of the brain's cerebral cortex. Commands are
routed though the basal ganglia and are modified by input from the cerebellum
before being relayed through the pyramidal tract to the spinal cord and from
there to the motor end plate at the muscles. Along the way, feedback, such as
that of the extrapyramidal system contribute signals to influence muscle tone
and response.

Deeper muscles such as those involved in posture often are controlled from
nuclei in the brain stem and basal ganglia.

### Afferent leg

The afferent leg of the peripheral nervous system is responsible for conveying
sensory information to the brain, primarily from the sense organs like the
skin. In the muscles, the muscle spindles convey information about the degree
of muscle length and stretch to the central nervous system to assist in
maintaining posture and joint position. The sense of where our bodies are in
space is called proprioception, the perception of body awareness. More easily
demonstrated than explained, proprioception is the "unconscious" awareness of
where the various regions of the body are located at any one time. This can be
demonstrated by anyone closing their eyes and waving their hand around.
Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose
awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected
by any of the other senses.

Several areas in the brain coordinate movement and position with the feedback
information gained from proprioception. The cerebellum and red nucleus in
particular continuously sample position against movement and make minor
corrections to assure smooth motion.

## Exercise

Exercise is often recommended as a means of improving motor skills, fitness,
muscle and bone strength, and joint function. Exercise has several effects
upon muscles, connective tissue, bone, and the nerves that stimulate the
muscles.

Various exercises require a predominance of certain muscle fiber utilization
over another. Aerobic exercise involves long, low levels of exertion in which
the muscles are used at well below their maximal contraction strength for long
periods of time (the most classic example being the marathon). Aerobic events,
which rely primarily on the aerobic (with oxygen) system, use a higher
percentage of Type I (or slow-twitch) muscle fibers, consume a mixture of fat,
protein and carbohydrates for energy, consume large amounts of oxygen and
produce little lactic acid. Anaerobic exercise involves short bursts of higher
intensity contractions at a much greater percentage of their maximum
contraction strength. Examples of anaerobic exercise include sprinting and
weight lifting. The anaerobic energy delivery system uses predominantly Type
II or fast-twitch muscle fibers, relies mainly on ATP or glucose for fuel,
consumes relatively little oxygen, protein and fat, produces large amounts of
lactic acid and can not be sustained for as long a period as aerobic exercise.
The presence of lactic acid has an inhibitory effect on ATP generation within
the muscle; though not producing fatigue, it can inhibit or even stop
performance if the intracellular concentration becomes too high. However,
long-term training causes neovascularization within the muscle, increasing the
ability to move waste products out of the muscles and maintain contraction.
Once moved out of muscles with high concentrations within the sarcomere,
lactic acid can be used by other muscles or body tissues as a source of
energy, or transported to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate.
The ability of the body to export lactic acid and use it as a source of energy
depends on training level.

Humans are genetically predisposed with a larger percentage of one type of
muscle group over another. An individual born with a greater percentage of
Type I muscle fibers would theoretically be more suited to endurance events,
such as triathlons, distance running, and long cycling events, whereas a human
born with a greater percentage of Type II muscle fibers would be more likely
to excel at anaerobic events such as a 200 meter dash, or weightlifting.
People with high overall musculation and balanced muscle type percentage
engage in sports such as rugby or boxing and often engage in other sports to
increase their performance in the former.[citations needed]

Delayed onset muscle soreness is pain or discomfort that may be felt one to
three days after exercising and subsides generally within two to three days
later. Once thought to be caused by lactic acid buildup, a more recent theory
is that it is caused by tiny tears in the muscle fibers caused by eccentric
contraction, or unaccustomed training levels. Since lactic acid disperses
fairly rapidly, it could not explain pain experienced days after exercise.[4]

## Disease

Main article: Neuromuscular disease

Symptoms of muscle diseases may include weakness, spasticity, myoclonus and
myalgia. Diagnostic procedures that may reveal muscular disorders include
testing creatine kinase levels in the blood and electromyography (measuring
electrical activity in muscles). In some cases, muscle biopsy may be done to
identify a myopathy, as well as genetic testing to identify DNA abnormalities
associated with specific myopathies and dystrophies.

Neuromuscular diseases are those that affect the muscles and/or their nervous
control. In general, problems with nervous control can cause spasticity or
paralysis, depending on the location and nature of the problem. A large
proportion of neurological disorders leads to problems with movement, ranging
from cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and Parkinson's disease to Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease.

A non-invasive elastography technique that measures muscle noise is undergoing
experimentation to provide a way of monitoring neuromuscular disease. The
sound produced by a muscle comes from the shortening of actomyosin filaments
along the axis of the muscle. During contraction, the muscle shortens along
its longitudinal axis and expands across the transverse axis, producing
vibrations at the surface.[5]

### Atrophy

There are many diseases and conditions which cause a decrease in muscle mass,
known as muscle atrophy. Example include cancer and AIDS, which induce a body
wasting syndrome called cachexia. Other syndromes or conditions which can
induce skeletal muscle atrophy are congestive heart disease and some diseases
of the liver.

During aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal
muscle function and mass, known as sarcopenia. The exact cause of sarcopenia
is unknown, but it may be due to a combination of the gradual failure in the
"satellite cells" which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a
decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth
factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell
survival. Sarcopenia is a normal aspect of aging, and is not actually a
disease state.

#### Physical inactivity and atrophy

Inactivity and starvation in mammals lead to atrophy of skeletal muscle,
accompanied by a smaller number and size of the muscle cells as well as lower
protein content.[6] In humans, prolonged periods of immobilization, as in the
cases of bed rest or astronauts flying in space, are known to result in muscle
weakening and atrophy. Such consequences are also noted in small hibernating
mammals like the golden-mantled ground squirrels and brown bats.[7]
Representatives of the Ursid species make for an interesting exception to this
expected norm.

Bears are famous for their ability to survive unfavorable environmental
conditions of low temperatures and limited nutrition availability during
winter by means of hibernation. During that time Ursids go through a series of
physiological, morphological and behavioral changes.[8] Their ability to
maintain skeletal muscle number and size at time of disuse is of a significant
importance. During hibernation bears spend four to seven months of inactivity
and anorexia without undergoing muscle atrophy and protein loss.[7] There are
a few known factors that contribute to the sustaining of muscle tissue. During
the summer period, Ursids take advantage of the nutrition availability and
accumulate muscle protein. The protein balance of bears at time of dormancy is
also maintained by lower levels of protein breakdown during the winter
time.[7] At times of immobility, muscle wasting in Ursids is also suppressed
by a proteolytic inhibitor that is released in circulation.[6] Another factor
that contributes to the sustaining of muscle strength in hibernating bears is
the occurrence of periodic voluntary contractions and involuntary contractions
from shivering during torpor.[9] The three to four daily episodes of muscle
activity are responsible for the maintenance of muscle strength and
responsiveness in bears during hibernation.[9]

## Strength

A display of "strength" (e.g. lifting a weight) is a result of three factors
that overlap: physiological strength (muscle size, cross sectional area,
available crossbridging, responses to training), neurological strength (how
strong or weak is the signal that tells the muscle to contract), and
mechanical strength (muscle's force angle on the lever, moment arm length,
joint capabilities). Contrary to popular belief, the number of muscle fibres
cannot be increased through exercise; instead the muscle cells simply get
bigger. Muscle fibres have a limited capacity for growth through hypertrophy
and some believe they split through hyperplasia if subject to increased
demand.[citation needed]

### The "strongest" human muscle

Since three factors affect muscular strength simultaneously and muscles never
work individually, it is misleading to compare strength in individual muscles,
and state that one is the "strongest". But below are several muscles whose
strength is noteworthy for different reasons.

  * In ordinary parlance, muscular "strength" usually refers to the ability to exert a force on an external objectâfor example, lifting a weight. By this definition, the masseter or jaw muscle is the strongest. The 1992 Guinness Book of Records records the achievement of a bite strength of 4,337 N (975 lbf) for 2 seconds. What distinguishes the masseter is not anything special about the muscle itself, but its advantage in working against a much shorter lever arm than other muscles.
  * If "strength" refers to the force exerted by the muscle itself, e.g., on the place where it inserts into a bone, then the strongest muscles are those with the largest cross-sectional area. This is because the tension exerted by an individual skeletal muscle fiber does not vary much. Each fiber can exert a force on the order of 0.3 micronewton. By this definition, the strongest muscle of the body is usually said to be the quadriceps femoris or the gluteus maximus.
  * A shorter muscle will be stronger "pound for pound" (i.e., by weight) than a longer muscle. The myometrial layer of the uterus may be the strongest muscle by weight in the human body. At the time when an infant is delivered, the entire human uterus weighs about 1.1 kg (40 oz). During childbirth, the uterus exerts 100 to 400 N (25 to 100 lbf) of downward force with each contraction.
  * The external muscles of the eye are conspicuously large and strong in relation to the small size and weight of the eyeball. It is frequently said that they are "the strongest muscles for the job they have to do" and are sometimes claimed to be "100 times stronger than they need to be." However, eye movements (particularly saccades used on facial scanning and reading) do require high speed movements, and eye muscles are exercised nightly during rapid eye movement sleep.
  * The statement that "the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body" appears frequently in lists of surprising facts, but it is difficult to find any definition of "strength" that would make this statement true. Note that the tongue consists of sixteen muscles, not one.
  * The heart has a claim to being the muscle that performs the largest quantity of physical work in the course of a lifetime. Estimates of the power output of the human heart range from 1 to 5 watts. This is much less than the maximum power output of other muscles; for example, the quadriceps can produce over 100 watts, but only for a few minutes. The heart does its work continuously over an entire lifetime without pause, and thus does "outwork" other muscles. An output of one watt continuously for eighty years yields a total work output of two and a half gigajoules.

## Efficiency

The efficiency of human muscle has been measured (in the context of rowing and
cycling) at 14% to 27%. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of mechanical
work output to the total metabolic cost.[citation needed]

## Density of muscle tissue compared to adipose tissue

The density of mammalian skeletal muscle tissue is about 1.06 kg/liter[10].
This can be contrasted with the density of adipose tissue (fat), which is
0.9196 kg/liter[11]. This makes muscle tissue approximately 15% denser than
fat tissue.

## Muscle evolution

Evolutionarily, specialized forms of skeletal and cardiac muscles predated the
divergence of the vertebrate/arthropod evolutionary line.[12] This indicates
that these types of muscle developed in a common ancestor sometime before 700
million years ago (mya). Vertebrate smooth muscle was found to have evolved
independently from the skeletal and cardiac muscles.
