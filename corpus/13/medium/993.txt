Nielsen Ratings are audience measurement systems developed by the AC Nielsen
Company, (now Nielsen Media Research) to determine the audience size and
composition of television programming. Founder Arthur Nielsen was a market
analysis specialist whose career had begun in the '20s with brand advertising
analysis and expanded into radio market analysis during the '30s, culminating
in Nielsen ratings of radio programming, meant to provide detailed and
accurate statistics as to markets of radio shows. In 1950, Nielsen moved to
television, developing an offshoot ratings system using the methods he and his
company had developed for radio. It has since been the primary source of
audience measurement information in the television industry around the world.
Recognizing that television as a business made its money by selling audiences
to advertisers, the Nielsen company developed sophisticated statistical
methodologies to help programmers and advertisers clearly target audiences and
markets. Nielsen Television Ratings are currently the single most important
element in determining advertising rates, schedules, and program
content.[citation needed]

## [edit] Measuring ratings

Nielsen Television Ratings are gathered in one of two ways, both of them
adaptations of the company's earliest methods. One involves the use of viewer
"diaries," in which a target audience self-records its viewing (or listening)
habits. By targeting various demographics, the assembled statistical models
promise an accurate rendering of the audiences of any given show, network,
programming hour, and the like. A more technologically sophisticated system
has used Set Meters, which are small devices connected to televisions in
selected homes. These devices gather the viewing habits of the home and
transmit the information nightly to Nielsen through a "Home Unit" connected to
a phone line. Set Meter information is meant to eliminate subject biases and
survey-response effects; scholarly literature has suggested that diarists
change their habits to conform to their desired profile. The technology-based
"home unit" system is meant to allow market researchers to more accurately
study television viewing habits on a minute to minute basis, seeing the exact
moment viewers change channels or turn off their TV. In addition to this
technology, the implementation of individual viewer reporting devices (called
people meters) has allowed the company to separate household viewing
information into various demographic groups, but has refused to change its
distribution of data of ethnic groups into sub categories in order to account
for the subcultures. This is most notable in parents vs. kids, and adult
immigrants versus their children. However, while this system removes one form
of bias, it cannot account for the presence of actual viewers in front of
sets, i.e. the "empty-room syndrome" in which tvs play without active viewers.

Changing systems of viewing, however, have been an active cause for Nielsen's
changing methods of market research. In 2005, Nielsen began measuring the
usage of digital video recordings (TiVo, for example) and initial results
indicate that time-shifted viewing will have a significant impact on
television ratings. The networks are not yet figuring these new results into
their ad rates at the resistance of advertisers.[1]

### [edit] Ratings/share and total viewers

The most commonly cited Nielsen results are reported in two measurements:
ratings points and share, usually reported as (ratings points/share). As of
September 1, 2008, there are an estimated 114.5 million television households
in the United States. A single national ratings point represents one percent
of the total number, or 1,145,000 households for the 2006-07 season.

Share is the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. For
example, Nielsen may report a show as receiving a 9.2/15 during its broadcast,
meaning that on average 9.2 percent of households were tuned in at any given
moment. Additionally, 15 percent of all televisions in use at the time were
tuned into this program (i.e. how many of those televisions were watching this
particular show). Nielsen re-estimates the number of households each August
for the upcoming television season. The difference between rating and share is
that a rating reflects the percentage of the total population of televisions
tuned to a particular program while share reflects the percentage of
televisions actually in use tuned to a particular program. [2]

Nielsen Media Research also provides statistics on estimated total number of
individual viewers, and on specific demographics. Advertising rates are
influenced not only by the total number of viewers, but also by particular
demographics, such as age, gender, economic class, and area. Younger viewers
are considered more attractive for many products, whereas in some cases older
and wealthier audiences are desired, or female audiences are desired over
males.

Because ratings are based on samples, it is possible for shows to get 0.0
share, despite having an audience; the CNBC talk show McEnroe was one notable
example.[3] Another example is The CW Television Network show, CW Now, which
received two 0.0 ratings in the same season.

The term is also used by Arbitron for describing the percentage listening to a
particular radio station out of all those listening to radio in the market
area.[4]

### [edit] Commercial ratings

Nielsen provides viewership data calculated as the average viewership for only
the commercial time within the program. This âCommercial Ratingsâ first
became available on May 31, 2007. Additionally, Nielsen provides different
âstreamsâ of this data in order to take into consideration delayed viewing
(DVR) data, at any interval up to seven days.[5] C3 was the metric launched in
2007. C3 refers to the ratings for average commercial minutes in live
programming plus three days of digital video recorder playback.[6]

### [edit] Sweeps

Much of the ratings system, however, still consists of the completion by
viewers of ratings diaries, in which a viewer records his or her viewing
habits, generally for a week, in exchange for being advanced a nominal amount
(up to $30 in the United States). These diaries play an especially important
role during the four sweeps periods conducted in February, May, July and
November in an attempt to measure smaller local market audiences in markets
that are not covered by People Meter samples already. (Other, smaller sweeps
are conducted through the year in the markets large enough to be measured by
non-demographic meters, but not large enough to be measured by the demographic
meters (people meters).

The term "sweeps" has two meanings. One refers to how the diaries were handled
by Nielsen Media when the ratings were first produced: They are mailed to the
households and processed by starting on the East Coast and "sweeping" across
the nation. The other refers to television programming during the months of
November, February, May and (of lesser importance) July, in which eagerly
anticipated programs are deliberately scheduled in order to boost television
ratings. Television networks and other programmers make unusual efforts to
attract additional viewers during these periods, including broadcasting mostly
original programming as opposed to repeats, showing more special broadcasts,
and including special content in programming such as guest stars,
controversial and unexpected plots or topics, extended episodes, finales, and
increased competition in advertising. Even news programs are often involved,
broadcasting especially controversial or titillating investigative reports and
promotions. For this reason, the "sweeps" system of national ratings has been
criticized as not representative of typical programming, and encouraging an
increase in content of concern such as violence and explicit sexuality.
Outside of these peak periods it is more common to see reruns of television
programs.

     Nielsen 2008 sweeps dates February 2008 31 January â 27 February, 2008  
May 2008 24 April â 21 May, 2008  
July 2008 3 July â 30 July, 2008  
November 2008 30 October â 26 November, 2008  
     Nielsen 2009 sweeps dates March 2009 March 5 - April 1, 2009  
May 2009 April 23 - May 20, 2009  
July 2009 July 2 - July 29, 2009  
November 2009 October 29 - November 25, 2009  
Note: The February 2009 sweeps period was moved to March so that the ratings
would not be affected by any problems created by the February 17th switchover
of the USA's analog broadcast television signals to digital. When, in early
February, the digital transition date was moved to June 12, the "February"
sweeps period for 2009 remained in March.

The change in the 2009 February sweeps schedule also provided a clearer
picture of ratings, because the new period did not include this year's Super
Bowl (in sweeps since 2004) or the Daytona 500 (in sweeps since 2007, when the
finish aired in primetime), both of which events often inflate ratings during
sweeps periods. It does, however, cover the first four rounds of the NCAA
Men's Basketball Tournament for the first time.

### [edit] Criticism of ratings systems

There is some public critique regarding accuracy and potential bias within
Nielsen's rating system. In June 2006, however, Nielsen announced a "sweeping"
plan to revamp its entire methodology to include all types of media viewing in
its sample.

Since viewers are aware of being part of the Nielsen sample, it can lead to
response bias in recording and viewing habits. This criticism is common to
many forms of survey research. Audience counts gathered by the self-reporting
diary methodology are sometimes higher than those gathered by the electronic
meters, which provide less opportunity for response bias. This trend seems to
be more common for news programming and popular prime time programming. Also,
daytime viewing and late night viewing tend to be under-reported by the diary.

Another criticism of the measuring system itself is that it fails the most
important criteria of a sample: it is not random in the statistical sense of
the word. Only a small fraction of the population is selected and only those
that actually accept are used as the sample size. Compounding matters is the
fact that of the sample data that is collected, advertisers will not pay for
time shifted (recorded for replay at a different time) programs [7] rendering
the 'raw' numbers useless. In many local areas, the difference between a
rating that keeps a show on the air and one that will cancel it is so small as
to be statistically insignificant, and yet the show that just happens to get
the higher rating will survive.[8] As the possible choices increase so does
the margin of error resulting in the sampling sizes being too small.[9]

In 2004, News Corporation retained the services of public relations firm
Glover Park to launch a campaign aimed at delaying Nielsen's plan to replace
its aging household electronic data collection methodology in larger local
markets with its newer and more accurate electronic People Meter system. The
advocates in the public relations campaign charged that data derived from the
newer People Meter system represented a bias toward underreporting minority
viewing, which could lead to a de-facto discrimination in employment against
minority actors and writers. Nielsen countered the campaign by revealing its
sample composition counts. According to Nielsen Media Research's sample
composition counts, as of November 2004[update], nationwide, African American
Households using People Meters represented 6.7% of the Nielsen sample,
compared to 6.0% in the general population. Latino Households represent 5.7%
of the Nielsen sample, compared to 5.0% in the general population. This showed
that ethnic minorities were actually overrepresented in the sample, contrary
to what was charged in the News Corporation's public relations
campaign.[citation needed]

Another criticism of the Nielsen ratings system is its lack of a system for
measuring television audiences in environments outside the home, such as
college dormitories, transport terminals, bars, and other public places where
television is frequently viewed, often by large numbers of people in a common
setting. In 2005, Nielsen has announced plans to incorporate viewing by away-
from-home college students into its sample. Internet TV viewing is another
rapidly growing market for which Nielsen Ratings fail to account for viewer
impact. Apple iTunes, atomfilms, YouTube, and some of the networks' own
websites (e.g., ABC.com, CBS.com) provide full-length web-based programming,
either subscription-based or ad-supported. Though web sites can already track
popularity of a site and the referring page, they can't track viewer
demographics. To both track this and expand their market research offerings,
Nielson purchased NetRatings in 2007.[10]

Furthermore, a new problem has developed primarily with the February sweeps.
For the 2001-2002 season, the National Football League moved Super Bowl XXXVI
to February, when it was placed in the sweeps period, because of the September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which postponed the NFL schedule a week. Because
of that, starting with the 2003-04 season, the NFL moved the Super Bowl into
the sweeps period.

Since the move of the Super Bowl into the sweeps period, Sunday nights in the
sweeps period in February is almost guaranteed to be a winner for the network
holding the big event on each of the four Sundays â the Super Bowl
(alternates among NBC, CBS, FOX), Grammy Awards (moved to Sundays since 2003
except during Olympics, CBS), Daytona 500 (finish moved into prime-time in
2007; FOX), or Academy Awards (moved into the sweeps period in 2004, ABC) and
every fourth year, the Winter Olympic Games (next telecast 2010, NBC).

## [edit] Annual top-rated shows

Nielsen began compiling ratings for television nationally beginning in 1950.
Before that year, television ratings were compiled by a number of other
sources, including C. E. Hooper and Variety. That company was bought out by
Nielsen in February 1950.
