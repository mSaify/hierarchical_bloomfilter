A T-shirt (or tee shirt) is a shirt which is pulled on over the head to cover
most of a person's torso. A T-shirt is usually buttonless, collarless, and
pocketless, with a round neck and short sleeves. The sleeves of the T-shirt
extend at least slightly over the shoulder but not completely over the elbow
(in short-sleeve version). A shirt that is either longer or shorter than this
ceases to be a T-shirt,[citation needed] but when longer is often referred to
as a "long sleeve T-shirt". T-shirts are typically made of cotton or polyester
fibers (or a mix of the two), knitted together in a jersey stitch that gives a
T-shirt its distinctive soft texture. T-shirts can be decorated with text
and/or pictures, and are sometimes used to advertise (see human billboard).

T-shirt fashions include styles for men and women, and for all age groups,
including baby, youth, and adult sizes. Many youths wear T-shirts; they are
great protection from the sun and useful for all wears, but the main reason
being the fashion[citation needed].

## [edit] Trends

T-shirts were originally worn as undershirts. Now T-shirts are worn frequently
as the only piece of clothing on the top half of the body, other than possibly
a bra or an undershirt (vest). T-shirts have also become a medium for self-
expression and advertising, with any imaginable combination of words, art and
even photographs on display.[1]

A T-shirt typically extends to the waist. Variants of the T-shirt, like the
tank top, A-shirt (with the nickname "wife beater"), muscle shirt, scoop neck,
and the V-neck have been developed. Hip hop fashion calls for "tall-T"
T-shirts which may extend down to the knees. A 1990's trend in women's
clothing involved tight-fitting "cropped" T-shirts that are short enough to
reveal the midriff. Another popular trend is wearing a "long-sleeved T-shirt",
then putting a short sleeved T-shirt of a different color over the long
sleeved shirt. This is known as "layering".

## [edit] Decoration

In the early 1950s several companies based in Miami, Florida, started to
decorate T-shirts with different resort names and various characters. The
first company was Tropix Togs, under founder Sam Kantor, in Miami. They were
the original licensee for Walt Disney characters that included Mickey Mouse
and Davy Crockett. Later other companies expanded into the T-shirt printing
business that included Sherry Manufacturing Company also based in Miami.
Sherry started in 1948 by its owner and founder Quinton Sandler as a screen
print scarf business and evolved into one of the largest screen printed resort
and licensed apparel companies in the United States.

In 1959, plastisol, a more durable and stretchable ink, was invented, allowing
much more variety in T-shirt designs.

In the 1960s, the ringer T-shirt appeared and became a staple fashion for
youth and rock-n-rollers. The decade also saw the emergence of tie-dyeing and
screen-printing on the basic T-shirt. In the late 1960s Richard Ellman, Robert
Tree, Bill Kelly, and Stanley Mouse set up the Monster Company in Mill Valley,
California, to produce fine art designs expressly for T-shirts. Monster
T-shirts often feature emblems and motifs associated with the Grateful Dead
and marijuana culture.[2]

The most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is screen-printing. In
screen-printing, a design is separated into individual colors. Plastisol or
water based inks are applied to the shirt through mesh screens which limits
the areas where ink is deposited. In most commercial T-shirt printing, the
specific colors in the design are used. To achieve a wider color spectrum with
a limited number of colors, process printing (using only cyan, magenta, yellow
and black ink) or simulated process (using only white, black, red, green,
blue, and gold ink) is effective. Process printing is best suited for light
colored shirts. Simulated process is best suited for dark colored shirts. Very
few companies continue to use water-based inks on their shirts. The majority
of other companies that create shirts prefer to use plastisol due to the
ability to print on varying colors without the need for color adjustment at
the art level.

Specialty inks trend in and out of fashion and include; shimmer, puff,
discharge and chino based inks. A metallic foil can be heat pressed and
stamped onto any plastisol ink. When combined with shimmer ink, metallics give
a mirror like effect wherever the previously screened plastisol ink was
applied. Specialty inks are more expensive to purchase as well as screen and
tend to appear on garments in boutiques.

Other methods of decoration used on T-shirts include airbrush, applique,
embroidery, impressing or embossing and the ironing on of either flock
lettering, heat transfers, or dye-sublimation transfers. Laser printers are
capable of printing on plain paper using a special toner containing
sublimation dyes which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.

In the 1980s, thermochromatic dyes were used to produce T-shirts that changed
colour when subjected to heat. This brand of T-shirt, Global Hypercolour, was
a common sight on the streets of the UK for a few years, but has since mostly
disappeared. These were very popular in the United States as well in the late
80's among teens. A downside of color-change garments is that the dyes can
easily be damaged, especially by washing in warm water, or dye other clothes
during washing.

At the turn of the century, designing custom T-shirts online became more
popular. Popular websites began to use digital printing (such as Direct to
Garment or DTG printing) and Online Embroidery to allow customers to design
their own T-shirts online with no minimum orders. In the beginning, DTG could
not print well on dark garments; however, with the help of some online T-Shirt
retailers, printer manufacturers such as T-Jet have all but perfected the
process, providing consumers with many more printing options[3]

## [edit] Expressive messages

Throughout the 1980s and ever since, T-shirts have flourished as a personal
expression.[4]

T-shirts with bold slogans were popular in the UK in the 1980s.

Since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, T-shirts with prominent
designer-name logos have become popular, especially with teenagers and young
adults. These garments allow consumers to flaunt their taste for designer
brands in an inexpensive way, in addition to being decorative. Examples of
designer T-shirt branding include Calvin Klein, FUBU, Ralph Lauren and The
Gap. These examples also include representations of rock bands, among other
obscure pop-culture references.

Screen printed T-shirts have been a standard form of product advertising for
major consumer products, such as Coca-cola and Mickey Mouse, since the 1970s.
However, since the 1990s, it has become common practice for companies of all
sizes to produce T-shirts with their corporate logos or messages as part of
their overall advertising campaigns.

The early 2000s saw the renewed popularity of T-shirts with slogans and
designs with a strong inclination to the humorous and/or ironic. The trend has
only increased later in this decade; embraced by celebrities, such as Britney
Spears and Paris Hilton, and reflected back on them, too ('Team
Aniston').[citation needed]

The political and social statements that T-shirts often display have become,
since the 2000s, one of the reasons that they have so deeply permeated
different levels of culture and society.[citation needed] The statements also
may be found to be offensive, shocking or pornographic to some. Many different
organizations have caught on to the statement-making trend, including chain
and independent stores, websites, and schools.

A popular phrase on the front of T-shirts demonstrating T-shirts' popularity
among tourists is the humorous phrase "I did _____ and all I got was this
lousy T-shirt." Examples include "I needlessly edited Wikipedia and all I got
was this lousy T-shirt." and "My parents went to Las Vegas and all I got was
this lousy T-shirt."

T-shirt exchange is an activity where people trade their T-shirts they are
wearing. Some designs specifically write on the shirt "trade with me".

## [edit] Environmental impact

A life cycle study of one T-shirt brand shows that the CO2 emissions from a
T-shirt is about 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) -- including the growing of the
cotton, manufacturing and wholesale distribution.[5] The loss of natural
habitat potential from the T-shirt is estimated to be 10.8 square meters (116
square feet).[6]
