Kappa (æ²³ç«¥ ?, "river-child"), alternately called KawatarÅ (å·å¤ªé ?,
"river-boy") or Kawako (å·å­ ?, "river-child") , are legendary creatures; a
type of water sprite found in Japanese folklore. However they are also
considered to be a part of cryptozoology, due to claims of sightings. In
ShintÅ they are considered to be one of many suijin (literally "water-
deity").

## [edit] Appearance

Most depictions show kappa as child-sized humanoids, though their bodies are
often more like those of monkeys or frogs than human beings. Some descriptions
say their faces are apelike, while others show them with beaked visages more
like those of tortoises or with duck beaks. Pictures usually show kappa with
thick shells and scaly skin that ranges in color from green to yellow or blue.

Kappa supposedly inhabit the ponds and rivers of Japan and have various
features to aid them in this environment, such as webbed hands and feet. They
are sometimes even said to smell like fish, and they can certainly swim like
them. The expression kappa-no-kawa-nagare ("a kappa drowning in a river")
conveys the idea that even experts make mistakes.

The most notable feature of the kappa, however, is the water-filled
depressions atop their heads. These cavities are surrounded by scraggly hair,
and this type of bobbed hair style is named okappa-atama for the creatures.
The kappa derive their incredible strength from these liquid-filled holes, and
anyone confronted with one may exploit this weakness by simply getting the
kappa to spill the water from its head. The kappa possesses a deep sense of
etiquette, so one trusted method is to appeal to this, for a kappa cannot help
but return a deep bow, even if it means losing its head-water in the process.
Once depleted, the kappa is seriously weakened and may even die. Other tales
say that this water allows kappa to move about on land, and once emptied, the
creatures are immobilized. Stubborn children are encouraged to follow the
custom of bowing on the grounds that it is a defense against kappa. In
addition, folklore suggests that kappa are masters of Koppo, a bone-breaking
technique which they invented.

Modern sign warning children of kappa lurking in water

Kappa are usually seen as mischievous troublemakers. Their pranks range from
the relatively innocent, such as loudly passing gas or looking up women's
kimonos, to the more troublesome, such as stealing crops or kidnapping
children. In fact, small children are one of the gluttonous kappa's favorite
meals, though they will eat adults as well. Even today, signs warning about
kappa appear by bodies of water in some Japanese towns and villages. Kappa are
also said to be afraid of fire, and some villages hold fireworks festivals
each year to scare the spirits away.

Kappa are not entirely antagonistic to mankind, however. They are curious of
human civilization, and they can understand and speak Japanese. They thus
sometimes challenge those they encounter to various tests of skill, such as
shogi or sumo wrestling. They may even befriend human beings in exchange for
gifts and offerings, especially cucumbers, the only food kappa are known to
enjoy more than human children. Japanese parents sometimes write the names of
their children (or themselves) on cucumbers and toss them into kappa-infested
waters in order to mollify the creatures and allow the family to
bathe.[citation needed] There is even a kind of cucumber-filled sushi roll
named for the kappa, the kappamaki.

Once befriended, kappa have been known to perform any number of tasks for
human beings, such as helping farmers irrigate their land. They are also
highly knowledgeable of medicine, and legend states that they taught the art
of bone setting to mankind. Due to these benevolent aspects, some shrines are
dedicated to the worship of particularly helpful kappa.[citation needed] Kappa
may also be tricked into helping people. Their deep sense of decorum will not
allow them to break an oath, for example, so if a human being can dupe a kappa
into promising to help him, the kappa has no choice but to follow through.
