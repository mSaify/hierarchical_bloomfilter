Essential amino acids are supplied by a healthy diet.

An essential amino acid or indispensable amino acid is an amino acid that
cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism (usually referring to humans),
and therefore must be supplied in the diet.

## [edit] Essentiality vs. conditional essentiality in humans

Eight amino acids are generally regarded as essential for humans:
phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine, methionine, leucine,
and lysine.[1] Cysteine (or sulphur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or
aromatic amino acids), histidine and arginine are additionally required by
infants and growing children.[2][3] Essential amino acids are so called not
because they are more important to life than the others, but because the body
does not synthesize them, making it essential to include them in one's diet in
order to obtain them. In addition, the amino acids arginine, cysteine,
glycine, glutamine, histidine, proline, serine and tyrosine are considered
conditionally essential, meaning they are not normally required in the diet,
but must be supplied exogenously to specific populations that do not
synthesize it in adequate amounts.[4][5] An example would be with the disease
phenylketonuria (PKU). Individuals living with PKU must keep their intake of
phenylalanine extremely low to prevent mental retardation and other metabolic
complications. However, phenylalanine is the precursor for tyrosine synthesis.
Without phenylalanine, tyrosine cannot be made and so tyrosine becomes
essential in the diet of PKU patients.

The distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat
unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The sulfur-
containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into
each other but neither can be synthesized de novo in humans. Likewise,
cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own.
So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a
single pool of nutritionally-equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino
acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and
citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a
single group.

## [edit] Recommended daily amounts

Estimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven
to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the
last 20 years. The following table lists the WHO recommended daily amounts
currently in use for essential amino acids in adult humans, together with
their standard one-letter abbreviations.[3]

Amino acid mg per kg body weight mg per 70 kg mg per 100 kg  
I Isoleucine 20 1400 2000  
L Leucine 39 2730 3900  
K Lysine 30 2100 3000  
M Methionine

\+ C Cysteine

15 (total) 1050 1500  
F Phenylalanine

\+ Y Tyrosine

25 (total) 1750 2500  
T Threonine 15 1050 1500  
W Tryptophan 4 280 400  
V Valine 26 1820 2600  
The recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10%
to 20% higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150%
higher in the first year of life.

## [edit] Use of essential amino acids

Foodstuffs that lack essential amino acids are poor sources of protein
equivalents, as the body tends to deaminate the amino acids obtained,
converting proteins into fats and carbohydrates[6]. Therefore, a balance of
essential amino acids is necessary for a high degree of net protein
utilization, which is the mass ratio of amino acids converted to proteins to
amino acids supplied.

Complete proteins contain a balanced set of essential amino acids for humans.
Animal sources such as meat, poultry, eggs, fish, milk, and cheese provide all
of the essential amino acids.[7] Complete proteins are also found in some
plant sources such as quinoa,[8] buckwheat,[9] hempseed,[10] and
amaranth,[citation needed] among others. Soya is near-complete[11] although
this is contested[8][12][13], while rice protein is a complete
protein.[8][14][15][16] It is not necessary to consume plant foods containing
complete proteins as long as a reasonably varied diet is maintained. By
consuming a wide variety of plant foods, a full set of essential amino acids
will be supplied and the human body can convert the amino acids into proteins.

The net protein utilization is profoundly affected by the limiting amino acid
content (the essential amino acid found in the smallest quantity in the
foodstuff), and somewhat affected by salvage of essential amino acids in the
body. It is therefore a good idea to mix foodstuffs that have different
weaknesses in their essential amino acid distributions. This limits the loss
of nitrogen through deamination and increases overall net protein utilization.

Protein source Limiting amino acid  
Wheat lysine  
Rice lysine  
Legumes tryptophan  
Maize lysine and tryptophan  
Pulses methionine (or cysteine)  
Egg, chicken none; the reference for absorbable protein  
## [edit] Mnemonics

Using the one letter designation shown above, mnemonic devices have been
developed for students wanting or needing to memorize the essential amino
acids. Previous devices have utilized the first letter of the amino acids
name, and in general did not include arginine which is not always essential.
One mnemonic device that has been used in the past is PVT TM HILL.[17]

Another method uses the first letter of each essential amino acid to begin
each word in a phrase, such as: "Any Help In Learning These Little Molecules
Proves Truly Valuable."[18] This method begins with the two amino acids that
need some qualifications as to their requirements.

Note that these devices work by using the first letter of the actual amino
acids name. Due to repetition of letters, several amino acids have one letter
abbreviations that are different than their first letter (e.g. lysine is K).
Thus the complete list of essential amino acids utilizing one-letter codes is
M,I,L,K,F,R,H,T,V,W. It would help college students to have a one letter code
mnemonic. One being: I Like Koala Vision Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Friday. Another could be I Like Killing Vehicles Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Friday. Yet another is M I L K FoR THe VW. And another is I'M LiKe WTF \-
