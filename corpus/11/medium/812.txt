The four stages of enlightenment in Buddhism are the four degrees of approach
to full enlightenment as an Arahant which a person can attain in this life.
The four stages are Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami and Arahant.

The teaching of the four stages of enlightenment is a central element of the
early Buddhist schools, including the surviving Theravada school of Buddhism.

## [edit] The Ordinary person

An ordinary person, or puthujjana (Pali; Sanskrit: pá¹thagjana) is trapped in
the endless changes of saá¹sara. Doing good or evil as influenced by his
desires and aversions, an ordinary person is born in higher or lower states of
being (heavens or hells) according to their actions. As these persons have
little control over their minds and behaviors, their destinies are haphazard
and subject to great suffering. The ordinary person has never seen and
experienced the ultimate truth of Dhamma, and therefore has no way of finding
an end to his predicament.

## [edit] The Noble persons

One who begins sincere training on the Buddhist path (known as Sekhas in Pali
or those in training) and experiences the truth to the extent of cutting of a
number of the ten mental fetters (Pali: saá¹yojana), becomes an ariya puggala
(Pali; Sanskrit: Äryapudgala): a "noble person" who will surely become an
Arahant in the near future (within seven lives). Their specific path is
governed by the degree of attainment reached.

"Among whatever communities or groups there may be, the Sangha of the
Tathagata's disciples is considered supreme... Those who have confidence in
the Sangha have confidence in what is supreme; and for those with confidence
in the supreme, supreme will be the result." [1]

The Sangha of the Tathagata's disciples (Ariya Sangha), i.e. the four [groups
of noble disciples] when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as persons. The
four groups of noble disciples (Buddhist Sekhas) when taken as pairs are those
who have attained:

  * I

(1) the path to stream-entry; (2) the fruition of stream-entry;

  * II

(3) the path to once-returning ; (4) the fruition of once-returning;

  * III

(5) the path to non-returning ; (6) the fruition of non-returning;

  * IV

(7) the path to arahantship ; (8) the fruition of arahantship.

Taking each attainment singly gives eight "individuals."

### [edit] Stream-enterer

Main article: SotÄpanna

The first stage is that of SotÄpanna (Pali; Sanskrit: SrotÄpanna), literally
meaning "one who enters (Äpadyate) the stream (sotas)," with the stream being
the Noble Eightfold Path regarded as the highest Dharma. The stream-enterer is
also said to have "opened the eye of the Dharma" (dhammacakkhu, Sanskrit:
dharmacaká¹£us).

A stream-enterer is guaranteed enlightenment after no more than seven
successive rebirths, and possibly in fewer. The stream-enterer can also be
sure that he will not be reborn in any of the unhappy states or rebirths (an
animal, a preta, or in hell). He can only be reborn as a human being, or in a
heaven.

The stream-enterer has attained an intuitive grasp of Buddhist doctrine
(samyagdá¹á¹£á¹­i or sammÄdiá¹­á¹­hi, "right view"), has complete confidence
or Saddha in the Three Jewels of Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, and has good
moral behaviour (Sila).

### [edit] Once-returner

Main article: Sakadagami

The second stage is that of the SakadÄgÄmÄ« (Sanskrit: Saká¹dÄgÄmin),
literally meaning "one who once (saká¹t) comes (Ägacchati)". The once-
returner will return to the human world only one more time, and will attain
Nirvana in that life.

### [edit] Non-returner

Main article: AnÄgÄmi

The third stage is that of the AnÄgÄmÄ« (Sanskrit: AnÄgÄmin), literally
meaning "one who does not (an-) come (Ägacchati)". The non-returner does not
come back into human existence, or any lower world, after death. Instead, he
is reborn in one of the worlds of the RÅ«padhÄtu called the ÅuddhÄvÄsa
worlds, or "Pure Abodes", where he will attain NirvÄá¹a; PÄli: Nibbana;
some of them are reborn a second time in a higher world of the Pure Abodes,
but in no case are born into a lower state.

An AnÄgÄmÄ« has abandoned the five lower fetters that bind the mind to the
cycle of rebirth. An AnÄgÄmÄ« is thus partially enlightened, and on the way
to perfect and complete Enlightenment.

### [edit] Arahant

Main article: Arahant

The fourth stage is that of Arahant, a fully enlightened human being who has
abandoned all fetters, and who upon decease (Sanskrit: ParinirvÄá¹a, PÄli:
ParinibbÄna) will not be reborn in any world, having wholly abandoned
saá¹sÄra.
