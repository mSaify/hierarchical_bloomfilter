A.G.Gurwitsch analysed the embryonic development of the sea-urchin as a
vector-field, as if the proliferation of cells into organs were brought about
by putative external forces.

    This article is about the mainstream developmental biology concept. For Rupert Sheldrake's concept of the same name see the corresponding section of Morphic field.
In developmental biology, a morphogenetic field is a group of cells able to
respond to discrete, localized biochemical signals leading to the development
of specific morphological structures or organs.[1][2] The spatial and temporal
extent of the embryonic fields are dynamic, and within the field is a
collection of interacting cells out of which a particular organ is formed.[3]
As a group, the cells within a given morphogenetic field are constrained â
i.e. cells in a limb field will become a limb tissue, those in a cardiac field
will become heart tissue.[4] Importantly, however, the specific cellular
programming of individual cells in a field is flexible: an individual cell in
a cardiac field can be redirected via cell-to-cell signaling to replace
specific damaged or missing cells.[4] Imaginal discs in insect larvae are
examples of morphogenetic fields.[5]

## [edit] Historical development

The concept of the morphogenetic field, fundamental in the early twentieth
century to the study of embryological development, was first introduced in
1910 by Alexander G. Gurwitsch.[6] Experimental support was provided by Ross
Granville Harrison's experiments transplanting fragments of a newt embryo into
different locations.[7]

Harrison was able to identify "fields" of cells producing organs such as
limbs, tail and gills and to show that these fields could be fragmented or
have undifferentiated cells added and a complete normal final structure would
still result. It was thus considered that it was the "field" of cells, rather
than individual cells, that were patterned for subsequent development of
particular organs. The field concept was developed further by Harrison's
friend Hans Spemann, and then by Paul Weiss and others.[3]

By the 1930s, however, the work of geneticists, especially Thomas Hunt Morgan,
revealed the importance of chromosomes and genes for controlling development,
and the rise of the new synthesis in evolutionary biology lessened the
perceived importance of the field hypothesis. Morgan was a particularly harsh
critic of fields since the gene and the field were perceived as competitors
for recognition as the basic unit of ontogeny.[3] With the discovery and
mapping of master control genes, such as the homeobox genes the pre-eminence
of genes seemed assured. But in the late twentieth century the field concept
was "rediscovered" as a useful part of developmental biology. It was found,
for example, that different mutations could cause the same malformations,
suggesting that the mutations were affecting a complex of structures as a
unit, a unit that might correspond to the field of early 20th century
embryology.

Scott Gilbert proposes that the morphogenetic field is a middle ground between
genes and evolution.[3] That is, genes act upon fields, which then act upon
the developing organism.[3]Jessica Bolker describes morphogenetic fields not
merely incipient structures or organs, but as dynamic entities with their own
localized development processes, which are central to the emerging field of
evolutionary development ("evo-devo").[8]
