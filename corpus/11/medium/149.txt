### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (0 through 100)
used by mental health clinicians and physicians to subjectively rate the
social, occupational and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well
or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. The scale is
presented and described in the DSM-IV-TR on page 32. Children and adolescents
under the age of 18 are evaluated on the Children's Global Assessment Scale,
or C-GAS.

91-100 Superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems
never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her
many qualities. No symptoms.  
81-90 Absent or minimal symptoms, good functioning in all areas, interested
and involved in a wide range of activities, socially effective, generally
satisfied with life, no more than everyday problems or concerns.  
71-80 If symptoms are present they are transient and expectable reactions to
psychosocial stresses; no more than slight impairment in social, occupational,
or school functioning.  
61-70 Some mild symptoms OR some difficulty in social, occupational, or school
functioning, but generally functioning pretty well, has some meaningful
interpersonal relationships.  
51-60 Moderate symptoms OR any moderate difficulty in social, occupational, or
school functioning.  
41-50 Serious symptoms OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or
school functioning.  
31-40 Some impairment in reality testing or communication OR major impairment
in several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment,
thinking, or mood.  
21-30 Behavior is considerably influenced by delusions or hallucinations OR
serious impairment in communications or judgment OR inability to function in
all areas.  
11-20 Some danger of hurting self or others OR occasionally fails to maintain
minimal personal hygiene OR gross impairment in communication.  
1-10 Persistent danger of severely hurting self or others OR persistent
inability to maintain minimum personal hygiene OR serious suicidal act with
clear expectation of death.

## [edit] Use in litigation

Montalvo v. Barnhart, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44133 (W.D.N.Y. 2005).

Montalvo attempts to substitute âoverall level of functioning and carrying
out activities of daily livingâ with âsocial, occupational, or school
functioning." It is possible to see the possibility of some degree of overlap
because "Social functioning" is arguably a subset of overall functioning and
Activities of daily living. However, some have argued that equivalence is not
clearly stated in DSM-IV-TR.

GAF levels are commonly used by the Veterans Benefits Administration of
theUnited States Department of Veterans Affairs in determining the appropriate
level of disability compensation to be paid to veterans who suffer from
service connected psychiatric disorders. The emphasis on using the GAF score
has, however, decreased in recent years.[1]
