"The Greeks" redirects here. For the ethnic group, see Greeks.

In mathematical finance, the Greeks are the quantities representing the
sensitivities of derivatives such as options to a change in underlying
parameters on which the value of an instrument or portfolio of financial
instruments is dependent. The name is used because the most common of these
sensitivities are often denoted by Greek letters. Collectively these have also
been called the risk sensitivities[1], risk measures[2] or hedge
parameters[3].

## [edit] Use of the Greeks

The table shows the relationship of the more common sensitivities to the four
primary inputs into the Black-Scholes model (spot price of the underlying
security, time remaining until option expiration, volatility and the rate of
return of a risk-free investment) and to the option's value, delta, gamma,
vega and vomma. Greeks which are a first-order derivative are in blue, second-
order derivatives are in green and third-order derivatives are in yellow. Note
that vanna is used, intentionally, in two places as these two sensitivities
are mathematically equivalent.  
The Greeks are vital tools in risk management. Each Greek measures the
sensitivity of the value of a portfolio to a small change in a given
underlying parameter, so that component risks may be treated in isolation, and
the portfolio rebalanced accordingly to achieve a desired exposure; see for
example delta hedging.

The Greeks in the Black-Scholes model are relatively easy to calculate, a
desirable property of financial models, and are very useful for derivatives
traders, especially those who seek to hedge their portfolios from adverse
changes in market conditions. For this reason, those Greeks which are
particularly useful for hedging delta, gamma and vega are well-defined for
measuring changes in Price, Time and Volatility. Although rho is a primary
input into the Black-Scholes model, the overall impact on the value of an
option corresponding to changes in the risk-free interest rate is generally
insignificant and therefore higher-order derivatives involving the risk-free
interest rate are not common.

The most common of the Greeks are the first order derivatives: Delta, Theta,
Vega and Rho as well as Gamma, a second-order derivative of the value
function. The remaining sensitivities in this list are common enough that they
have common names, but this list is by no means exhaustive.

### [edit] Charm

Charm = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^2
V}{\\partial S \\partial \\tau}  
Charm or delta decay, measures the instantaneous rate of change of delta over
the passage of time. Charm has also been called DdeltaDtime[4]. Charm can be
an important greek to measure/monitor when delta-hedging a position over a
weekend. Charm is a second order derivative of the option value, once to price
and once to time.

#### [edit] Practical use

The mathematical result of the formula for charm (see below) is expressed in
delta/year. It is often useful to divide this by the number of days per year
to arrive at the delta decay per day. This use is fairly accurate when the
number of days remaining until option expiration is large. When an option
nears expiration, charm itself may change quickly, rendering full day
estimates of delta decay inaccurate.

### [edit] Color

Color = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^3
V}{\\partial S^2 \\partial \\tau}  
Color[5], gamma decay or DgammaDtime[6] measures the rate of change of gamma
over the passage of time. Color is a third-order derivative of the option
value, twice to underlying asset price and once to time. Color can be an
important sensitivity to monitor when maintaining a gamma-hedged portfolio as
it can help the trader to anticipate the effectiveness of the hedge as time
passes.

#### [edit] Practical use

The mathematical result of the formula for color (see below) is expressed in
gamma/year. It is often useful to divide this by the number of days per year
to arrive at the change in gamma per day. This use is fairly accurate when the
number of days remaining until option expiration is large. When an option
nears expiration, color itself may change quickly, rendering full day
estimates of gamma change inaccurate.

### [edit] Delta

\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}  
Delta Î measures the rate of change of option value with respect to changes
in the underlying asset's price. Delta is the first derivative of the value,
V, of a portfolio of derivative securities on a single underlying instrument,
S, with respect to the underlying instrument's price.

#### [edit] Practical use

Even though delta will be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 for a call and 0.0 and
-1.0 for a put, these number are commonly presented as a percentage of the
total number of shares represented by the option contract(s). This is
convenient because the option will (instantaneously) behave like number of
shares indicated by the delta. For example, if a American call option on XYZ
has a delta of 0.25, it will gain or lose value just like 25% of 100 shares or
25 shares of XYZ as the price changes for small price movements.

Delta is always positive for long calls and short puts and negative for long
puts and short calls. The total delta of a complex portfolio of positions on
the same underlying asset can be calculated by simply taking the sum of the
deltas for each individual position. Since the delta of underlying asset is
always 1.0, the trader could delta-hedge his entire position in the underlying
by buying or shorting the number of shares indicated by the total delta. For
example, if a portfolio of options in XYZ (expressed as shares of the
underlying) is +275, the trader would be able to delta-hedge the portfolio by
selling short 275 shares of the underlying. This portfolio will then retain
its total value regardless of which direction the price of XYZ moves. (Albeit
for only small movements of the underlying, a short amount of time and not-
withstanding changes in other market conditions such as volatility and the
rate of return for a risk-free investment).

#### [edit] As a proxy for probability

Some option traders also use the absolute value of delta as an approximation
of the probability that the option will expire in-the-money. For example, if
an out-of-the-money call option has a delta of 0.15, the trader might estimate
that the option has appropriately a 15% chance of expiring in-the-money.
Similarly, if a put contract has a delta of -0.25, the trader might estimate
that the likelihood of the put expiring in-the-money is 25%. (Exactly) at-the-
money puts and calls have a delta of 0.5 and -0.5 respectively, or each will
have an estimated 50% chance of expiring in-the-money.

#### [edit] Relationship between call and put delta

Given a call and put option for the same underlying, strike price and time to
maturity, the sum of the absolute values of the delta of each option will be
1.00

If the value of delta for an option is known, one can compute the value of the
option of the same strike price, underlying and maturity but opposite right by
subtracting 1 from the known value. For example, if the delta of a call is .42
then one can compute the delta of the corresponding put a the same strike
price by 0.42 - 1 = -0.58.

### [edit] DvegaDtime

\\frac{\\partial \\nu}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial
\\sigma \\partial \\tau}  
DvegaDtime[7], measures the rate of change in the vega with respect to the
passage of time. DvegaDtime is the second derivative of the value function;
once to volatility and once to time.

#### [edit] Practical use

It is common practice to divide the mathematical result of DvegaDtime by 100
times the number of days per year to reduce the value to the percentage change
in vega per one day.

### [edit] Lambda

\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}\\times\\frac{1}{V}  
Lambda Î», omega Î© or elasticity is the percentage change in option value per
change in the underlying price. It is the logarithmic derivative.

### [edit] Gamma

\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta}{\\partial S} = \\frac{\\partial^2
V}{\\partial S^2}  
Gamma Î measures the rate of change in the delta with respect to changes in
the underlying price. Gamma is the second derivative of the value function
with respect to the underlying price. Gamma is important because it corrects
for the convexity of value.

When a trader seeks to establish an effective delta-hedge for a portfolio, the
trader may also seek to neutralize the portfolio's gamma, as this will ensure
that the hedge will be effective over a wider range of underlying price
movements.

### [edit] Rho

\\rho = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r}  
Rho Ï measures sensitivity to the applicable interest rate. Rho is the
derivative of the option value with respect to the risk free rate. Except
under extreme circumstances, the value of an option is least sensitive to
changes in the risk-free-interest rates. For this reason, rho is the least
used of the primary Greeks.

#### [edit] Practical use

Rho is typically expressed as the amount of money, per share, that the value
of the option will gain or lose as the rate of return of a risk-free
investment rises or falls by 1.0%.

### [edit] Speed

Speed = \\frac{\\partial\\Gamma}{\\partial S} = \\frac{\\partial^3
V}{\\partial S^3}  
Speed measures the rate of change in Gamma with respect to changes in the
underlying price. This is also sometimes referred to as the gamma of the gamma
[8] or DgammaDspot[9]. Speed is the third derivative of the value function
with respect to the underlying spot price. Speed can be important to monitor
when delta-hedging or gamma-hedging a portfolio.

### [edit] Theta

\\Theta = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\tau}  
Theta Î, or "time decay," measures sensitivity of the value of an option to
the passage of time (see Option time value).

#### [edit] Practical use

The mathematical result of the formula for theta (see below) is expressed in
value/year. By convention, it is useful to divide the result by the number of
days per year to arrive at the amount of money, per share of the underlying
that the option loses in one day. Theta is always negative for long calls and
puts and positive for short (or written) calls and puts. The total theta for a
portfolio of options can be determined by simply taking the sum of the thetas
for each individual position.

The value of an option is made up of two parts: the intrinsic value and the
time value. The intrinsic value is the amount of money you would gain if you
exercised the option immediately, so a call with strike $50 on a stock with
price $60 would have intrinsic value of $10, whereas the corresponding put
would have zero intrinsic value. The time value is the worth of having the
option of waiting longer when deciding to exercise. Even a deeply out of the
money put will be worth something as there is some chance the stock price will
fall below the strike. However, as time approaches maturity, there is less
chance of this happening, so the time value of an option is decreasing with
time. Thus if you are long an option you are short theta: your portfolio will
lose value with the passage of time (unless there is enough volatility to
offset this).

### [edit] Ultima

Ultima = \\frac{\\partial vomma}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial^3
V}{\\partial S \\partial \\sigma^2}  
Ultima measures the sensitivity of the option vomma with respect to change in
volatility. Ultima has also been reverred to as DvommaDvol[10]. Ultima is a
third order derivative of the option value; once to the underlying spot price
and twice to volatility.

### [edit] Vanna

Vanna

= \\frac{\\partial \\Delta}{\\partial \\sigma}

= \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S \\partial \\sigma}

  
Vanna, also referred to as DvegaDspot and DdeltaDvol[11], measures the
sensitivity of the option vega with respect to change in the underlying spot
price. Vanna is a second order derivative of the option value; once to the
underlying spot price and once to volatility and is mathematically equivalent
to DdeltaDvol[12]: the sensitivity of the option delta with respect to change
in volatility. Vanna can be a useful sensitivity to monitor when maintaining a
delta- or vega-hedged portfolio as vanna will help the trader to anticipate
changes to the effectiveness of a delta-hedge as volatility changes or the
effectiveness of a vega-hedge against change in the underlying spot price.

### [edit] Vega

\\nu=\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\sigma}  
Vega, is not actually a Greek letter (The Greek letter nu, \\nu\\, is used
instead). Vega measures sensitivity to volatility. Vega is the derivative of
the option value with respect to the volatility of the underlying. The term
kappa, Îº, is sometimes used (by academics) instead of vega, as is tau, Ï,
though this is rare.

#### [edit] Practical use

Vega is typically expressed as the amount of money, per underlying share the
option's value will gain or lose as volatility rises or falls by 1%.

Vega can be an important Greek to monitor for an option trader, especially in
volatile markets since some the value of option strategies can be particularly
sensitive to changes in volatility. The value of an option straddle, for
example, is extremely dependant on changes to volatility.

### [edit] Vomma

Vomma = \\frac{\\partial \\nu}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial^2
V}{\\partial \\sigma^2}  
Vomma[13], Volga[14], Vega Convexity[15] or Vega gamma measures second order
sensitivity to implied volatility. Volga is the second derivative of the
option value with respect to the volatility, or, stated another way, volga
measures the rate of change to vega as volatility changes.

### [edit] Zomma

Zomma = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial^3
V}{\\partial S^2 \\partial \\sigma}  
Zomma measures the rate of change of gamma with respect to changes in
volatility. Zomma has also been referred to as DgammaDvol[16]. Zomma is the
third derivative of the option value, twice to underlying asset price and once
to volatility. Zomma can be a useful sensitivity to monitor when maintaining a
gamma-hedged portfolio as zomma will help the trader to anticipate changes to
the effectiveness of the hedge as volatility changes.

## [edit] Black-Scholes

The Greeks under the Black-Scholes model are calculated as follows, where Ï
(phi) is the standard normal probability density function and Î¦ is the
standard normal cumulative distribution function. Note that the gamma and vega
formulas are the same for calls and puts.
