# Stages of faith development

### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

A series of stages of faith development was proposed by Professor James W.
Fowler, a developmental psychologist at Candler School of Theology, in the
book Stages of Faith. This book-length study contains a framework and ideas,
which have generated a good deal of response from those interested in
religion.

It proposes a staged development of faith (or spiritual development) across
the lifespan. It is closely related to the work of Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson,
and Lawrence Kohlberg regarding aspects of psychological development in
children and adults.

## [edit] Fowler's stages

<IMG> This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.  
Faith is seen as a holistic orientation, and is concerned with the
individual's relatedness to the universal:

  * Stage 0 â "Primal or Undifferentiated" faith (birth to 2 years), is characterized by an early learning of the safety of their environment (ie. warm, safe and secure vs. hurt, neglect and abuse).

  * Stage 1 â "Intuitive-Projective" faith (ages of three to seven), is characterized by the psyche's unprotected exposure to the Unconscious.

  * Stage 2 â "Mythic-Literal" faith (mostly in school children), stage two persons have a strong belief in the justice and reciprocity of the universe, and their deities are almost always anthropomorphic.

  * Stage 3 â "Synthetic-Conventional" faith (arising in adolescence) characterized by conformity

  * Stage 4 â "Individuative-Reflective" faith (usually mid-twenties to late thirties) a stage of angst and struggle. The individual takes personal responsibility for their beliefs and feelings.

  * Stage 5 â "Conjunctive" faith (mid-life crisis) acknowledges paradox and transcendence relating reality behind the symbols of inherited systems

  * Stage 6 â "Universalizing" faith, or what some might call "enlightenment".

## [edit] Empirical research into faith development

Fowler's model has inspired a considerable body of empirical research into
faith development, although little of such research has been conducted by
Fowler himself. A useful tool here has been Gary Leak's Faith Development
Scale, or FDS, which has been subject to factor analysis by Leak (Leak, 2008).
