Graph of the Yerkes-Dodson Law

The Yerkes-Dodson law is an empirical relationship between arousal and
performance, originally developed by psychologists, Robert M. Yerkes and John
Dillingham Dodson in 1908.[1] The law dictates that performance increases with
physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of
arousal become too high, performance decreases. The process is often
illustrated graphically as a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped curve which
increases and then decreases with higher levels of arousal.

Research has found that different tasks require different levels of arousal
for optimal performance. For example, difficult or intellectually demanding
tasks may require a lower level of arousal (to facilitate concentration),
whereas tasks demanding stamina or persistence may be performed better with
higher levels of arousal (to increase motivation).

Because of task differences, the shape of the curve can be highly variable.
For simple or well learned tasks, the relationship can be considered linear
with improvements in performance as arousal increases. For complex,
unfamiliar, or difficult tasks, the relationship between arousal and
performance becomes inverse, with declines in performance as arousal
increases.

The effect of task difficulty led to the hypothesis that the Yerkes-Dodson Law
can be decomposed into two distinct factors. The upward part of the inverted U
can be thought of as the energizing effect of arousal. The downward part is
caused by negative effects of arousal (or stress) on cognitive processes like
attention (e.g. "tunnel vision"), memory, and problem-solving.

There has been research indicating that the correlation suggested by Yerkes
and Dodson exists (such as that of Broadhurst, 1959; Duffy, 1962; Anderson,
1988), but a cause of the correlation has not yet successfully been
established (Anderson, Revelle, & Lynch, 1989).[2]

The Yerkes-Dodson law predicts that overlearning can improve performance in
states of high arousal.[3]
