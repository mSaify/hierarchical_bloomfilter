Kings (also less commonly known as "Thumbmaster" King's Cup, Sociables, Four
Kings, King of beers, Captain Dickhead, Circle of Death, Cards Have Values,
Ring of Fire, or Ace to the face) is a popular drinking game. It uses a
standard deck of playing cards. The deck of cards are shuffled and spread down
on a table, usually in a circle. In some variations, a cup is placed in the
center of the table. The game goes around the table with each player drawing
one card at a time. Each card has a different action associated with it, which
are listed below.

## [edit] Equipment

  * 1 glass or mug
  * 1 deck of playing cards
  * 3 or more people
  * Sufficient alcoholic beverages to induce inebriation upon completion of the game

## [edit] Official rules

It should be noted here that it is customary for "house rules" to be
established before the beginning of the game. All parties involved (or else
the host) should agree on the rules before commencement of the game to prevent
disagreements due to variances in rules. Often, if a particular apartment or
person hosts drinking nights, it's often a smart idea to keep the rules of
Kings written on a small whiteboard, for all to see. If at some point, a guest
of a party suggests a good variance, the rules can then be easily updated. If
they are posted, no one can argue with the rules.

To begin the game, spread a deck of cards face down in a circle around an
empty cup. Later in the game, if a player "breaks the seal", he or she must
drink.[1]

This also can be used with the "mushroom rule", where players place a full can
or bottle of beer in the center of the circle of cards, and, as each card is
drawn, it is placed on the full beer, with at least two corners hanging
unsupported by cards underneath. The first person to place a card on top of
the beer and knock off the cards has to chug the full beer. This is an option
to use if the players decide not to use the "king's cup" rule.

Another variant is to have a full can of beer in the center of the circle of
cards and, as each card is drawn, it is placed under the tab of the beer can.
Whichever person places the card that breaks the seal of the beer is required
to chug the full beer.

Others play with the additional rule that players can only touch the card that
they are currently drawing from the circle.

### [edit] "Number" cards

Cards with numbers 2 to 4 are worth their face value in fingers (the amount if
drink from the vessel as is required to equal the width of one finger pressed
against the glass).

Color Rule  
Black â£ â  "Black You Give Back" \- The player must give out the face
amount in fingers to other player(s).  
Red â¥ â¦

"Red To The Head" \- The player must take that amount of fingers him/herself.  
### [edit] "Special" cards

Cards 5 to Ace (A) are all special cards. The color/suit of the card does not
matter.

Card Rule  
<IMG> "Guys" \- Guy's Drink.  
<IMG> "Chicks" \- Chick's Drink..[2]  
<IMG> "Heaven" \- Everyone points to the sky, and last to do has to drink.  
<IMG> "Strait" \- The person across from you drinks.[1]  
<IMG> "Rhyme Time" \- The player must pick a word/phrase, and, going clockwise
around the circle, all players must think of a rhyme with the word/phrase. The
player to mess up the rhyme drinks. The starting word must not be rhymeless
(e.g. orange, purple).[1]  
<IMG> "Categories" \- The person who picks up the card calls out a category
such as "car makes" or "Family Guy characters" and then starts with the first
example of something from that category. No example can be repeated and the
first person to fail to come up with another example drinks 2 fingers.[2][3]  
<IMG> "Rule" \- The player must choose a rule to be in effect for the rest of
the game. If any player breaks a rule, he/she must drink.[1] In most games,
the rules become void while involved in game related activity (Rhyme Time,
Questions, etc.)  
<IMG> "Buffalo" \- When this rule is in effect all players must drink with
their left hand only. If a player gets caught drinking with their right hand,
anyone may call "Buffalo" on them and they have to finish their drink. [2]  
<IMG> "King's Cup" \- The player may pour a decent amount of whatever he/she
is drinking into the "king cup" located in the center of the table. When the
last (4th) king is chosen, the chooser has to chug the king cup.[2]  
<IMG> "Waterfall" \- All players begin to drink at the same time. It goes
clockwise around the circle where the player next to the card-chooser cannot
stop until the chooser does, and the 3rd player cannot stop until the 2nd one
does, and so it goes around the circle until everyone is done.  
## [edit] Other variants

There are probably as many variants of Kings as there are groups who play the
game. There is no right game or wrong game, no right rules or wrong rules. The
wealth of different rules allows people to choose the rules that they feel
will be the most fun. Below are some examples of different card values:  
  
Ace To the Face  
Twos for You  
Threes For me  
Four to the Floor  
Fives for guys  
Six for chicks  
Sevens to Heaven  
Eight With a Mate  
Nines a Rhyme; Nine, Busta Rhyme  
Ten: Categories  
Jack: Rule  
Queen: Question  
King's Cup

### [edit] Card specific rule variants

Card Rule  
<IMG> "Avalanche" \- The person who drew the card must start drinking and each
subsequent starts drinking at the same time. The person who drew the card can
stop drinking whenever they want to, but the person after them cannot stop
until the person before them has stopped[2]  
<IMG> "You" \- The player picks someone ("you," which rhymes with two) who
must then drink[2]  
<IMG> "Me" \- The player who drew the card ("me," which rhymes with three)
takes a drink[2]  
<IMG> "Whores" \- All the girls drink[2]  
<IMG> "Never Have I Ever" \- Everybody puts up either three or five fingers
and you go around the circle saying things that you have never done. Whenever
someone in the circle has done whatever was just said, they put down a finger.
The first person to put down all fingers drinks.  
<IMG> "Dicks" \- All the guys drink[2]  
<IMG> "Heaven" \- Everyone points to the ceiling and the last person to do so
takes a drink[2]  
<IMG> "Make a Date" \- The person who draws this card picks somebody who from
then on, is their "date", meaning that when the person who drew this card
drinks, their "date"also has to drink[1]  
<IMG> "Categories" \- The person who drew this card must pick a category
(Types of condoms, brands of beer, dog breeds, etc.) and everyone must name
something in that category. The first person to screw up, drinks.[1]  
<IMG> "Thumbmaster" \- The person that draws this card becomes the thumbmaster
until someone else draws another jack, meaning that at any point in the game,
the thumbmaster can put their thumb on the edge of the table very discreetly,
and the last person to notice and do so themselves, has to drink.[1]  
<IMG> "Bitches Drink" \- All girls must take a drink.[1]

has all their fingers down first loses and must drink. If someone says
something they haven't done and no one else has done it either, they (the
suggester, not the group) must take a drink, but the "mini game" still
continues until someone has all five fingers down.  
<IMG> "Dicks" \- Guys Drink.  
<IMG> "Heaven" \- Raise your hands up...then the person that drew the card
comes up with a who's most likely question, and asks it to the group, and you

versa for the duration of the game. You can make "chains of mates" buy

mate draws an Ace, the Ace of your Face "mini game" is meant only for the
indvidual who drew the Ace.  
<IMG> "Viking Master" \- While 'Viking Master' you have the ability, at any
point, to put your hands by the side of your head (your fingers are wide

### [edit] Other cards values

  * Fuck you in the toe \- When this card is flipped, everyone shouts, "fuck you". The last player to say the phrase must take a drink.[3]

  * Toilet \- If the players are using a rule outlawing toilet breaks, this card entitles a player to leave the table to make use of the toilet later on in the game. This card can also place the player in a position of power over someone who is desperately needing to use the toilet. This card may be offered to another player.[3]
  * Freeze \- When a player picks up this card, he or she retains it. At any point throughout the game, he or she can freeze in any position. The last person to follow his or her example, and freeze in the same pose, must drink.[3]
  * Snake eyes \- If a player holds this card, no one can look into his or her eyes. Any player breaking this rule must drink. This lasts until another player draws the same card, thus he or she becomes snake eyes. (Also known as "spy-eyes") [3]
  * Number chant \- If this rule is assigned to, for example, seven, the players, starting at number one, take turns counting up by ones (1, 2, 3, etc). The players count clockwise around the table. Each time either a multiple of seven or a number with seven in it is said, the number must be replaced with the word "reverse". Then, the direction of the counting reverses going counterclockwise. The first player to say a number with seven in it or a multiple of seven must drink.[3]
  * Five to the Sky \- When a five is drawn the last player to put their hand up in the air must drink [4]
  * The 7 rule \- When a seven a drawn, the group goes clockwise and takes it in turns to count upwards from the number one, but you are not allowed to say a number that is a multiple of seven, or a number that has the number seven in it, so you are not allowed to say 14 as it is a multiple of seven, or the number 73 as it has the number seven in it. The first person to say a number with seven in it, the first person to say a multiple of seven or the first person to go wrong counting upwards has to drink. Any number that is a multiple of seven, or with the number seven in it must be skipped and the player must count upwards to the next number that does not have a multiple of seven in it, or a the number seven in it.
  * Ace to the Face \- When an Ace is drawn, everyone must put one hand on their face, like if they are slapping themselves. Last person to do this must drink.

  * Thorns \- When this rule is in effect, any time a player is handed drinks from another player the players on either side of him/her take half the drinks the original player was handed.
  * Category \- When an individual draws this card they must think of a category (ex. types of cars, colors, movie titles that start with the letter 'L', etc.) and that indivdual starts by naming something within that category and then the person to his/her left must say another item within that category without repeating other peoples items. This is continued until someone cannot think of anything else to add within the category and must drink.
  * Spin the Bottle \- A classic game of spin the bottle is initiated, and where the bottle points, the 2 participants must kiss for an alloted perod of time. If they kiss, everyone else drinks, if they bottle it (excuse the pun), then they both must drink once if they are both of the same gender, and treble if they are of opposite genders.
