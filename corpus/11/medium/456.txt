A niche market is the subset of the market on which a specific product is
focusing on; Therefore the market niche defines the specific product features
aimed at satisfy specific market needs, as well as the price range, production
quality and the demographics that is intending to impact.

Every single product that is on sale can be defined by its niche market. As of
special note, the products aimed at a wide demographics audience, with the
resulting low price (due to Price elasticity of demand), are said to belong to
the Mainstream niche, in practice referred only as Mainstream or of high
demand. Narrowed demographics though lead to elevated price because of the
same principles.

In practice, product vendors and trade businesses are commonly referred as
mainstream providers or narrow demographics niche market providers
(colloquially shortened to just niche market providers). Small capital
providers usually opt for a niche market with narrow demographics as a measure
of increasing their gain margins.

Nevertheless, the final product quality (low or high) is not dependant on the
price elasticity of demand though, it is more associated with the specific
needs that the product is aimed at satisfy and in some cases with brand
recognition which the vendor wants to be associated with (i.e Prestige,
Practicability, Money saving, Expensiveness, Planet environment conscience,
Power, etc)

## [edit] Etymology

The term "niche" (pronounced nich, nÄsh, or nish) was first used by
ecologists to describe a species' position and use of resources within its
environment. When used in business the term implies a situation or an activity
perfectly suited to a person or a given type of personality. This concept has
been extended from persons to products on the market. Whereas a niche in the
strict sense can be a working position or an area suited to a person who
occupies it, the market niche is perfectly suited for a product of human
labour.

## [edit] Marketing in and for niche markets

Niche marketing is the process of finding and serving profitable market
segments and designing custom-made products or services for them. For big
companies those market segments are often too small in order to serve them
profitably as these market segments often lack economies of scale. Niche
marketers are often reliant on the loyalty business model to maintain a
profitable volume of sales.

## [edit] Online niche marketing

An often used technique for affiliate marketers. By seeking out smaller
segments of larger markets, a website can be developed and promoted quickly to
uniquely serve a targeted and usually loyal customer base, giving the
affiliate a small but regular income stream. This technique is then repeated
across several other niche websites until a desired income level is achieved.
