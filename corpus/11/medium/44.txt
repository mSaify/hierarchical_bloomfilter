## [edit] History

### [edit] Original version

It first appeared on the 1970 album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, on which
Scott-Heron recited the piece, accompanied only by congas and bongo drums.

A re-recorded version, this time with a full band, appeared on the 1971 album
Pieces of a Man and as the b-side to the single "Home Is Where The Hatred Is".

All these releases were issued on the Flying Dutchman Productions label. The
piece's name was also used as the title to Scott-Heron's "Best of" album,
issued in 1998 by RCA.

The song appeared in the film The Hurricane by Norman Jewison about the
wrongful imprisonment of boxer Rubin Carter and the fight to free him from
injustice.
