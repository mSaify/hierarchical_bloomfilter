Ecovillages are intended to be socially, economically and ecologically
sustainable intentional communities. Some aim for a population of 50-150
individuals because this size is considered to be the maximum social network
according to findings from sociology and anthropology.[1] Larger ecovillages
of up to 2,000 individuals exist as networks of smaller subcommunities to
create an ecovillage model that allows for social networks within a broader
foundation of support. Certain ecovillages have grown by the nearby addition
of others, not necessarily members, settling on the periphery of the
ecovillage and effectively participating in the ecovillage community (see, for
example, Findhorn).

Ecovillage members are united by shared ecological, social-economic and
cultural-spiritual values (see Intentional community). An ecovillage is often
composed of people who have chosen an alternative to centralized electrical,
water, and sewage systems. Many see the breakdown of traditional forms of
community, wasteful consumerist lifestyles, the destruction of natural
habitat, urban sprawl, factory farming, and over-reliance on fossil fuels, as
trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster. They see small-scale
communities with minimal ecological impact as an alternative. However, such
communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own (see
Global Ecovillage Network for an example). This model of collective action is
similar to that of Ten Thousand Villages, which supports the fair trade of
goods worldwide.

## [edit] Definition

In 1991, Robert Gilman set out a definition of an ecovillage that was to
become a standard. Gilman defined an ecovillage as a:

  * human-scale
  * full-featured settlement
  * in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural world
  * in a way that is supportive of healthy human development, and
  * can be successfully continued into the indefinite future.[2]

Note: In recent years, Gilman has stated that he would also add the criterion
that an ecovillage must have multiple centres of initiative.

## [edit] Characteristics of ecovillages

The principles on which ecovillages rely can be applied to urban and rural
settings, as well as to developing and developed countries. Advocates seek a
sustainable lifestyle (for example, of voluntary simplicity) for inhabitants
with a minimum of trade outside the local area, or ecoregion. Many advocates
also seek independence from existing infrastructures, although others,
particularly in more urban settings, pursue more integration with existing
infrastructure. Rural ecovillages are usually based on organic farming,
permaculture and other approaches which promote ecosystem function and
biodiversity. Ecovillages, whether urban or rural, tend to integrate community
and ecological values within a principle-based approach to sustainability,
such as permaculture design.[3]

An ecovillage usually relies on:

  * "Green" infrastructural capital;
  * autonomous building or clustered housing, to minimize ecological footprint;
  * renewable energy;
  * permaculture;

The goal of most ecovillages is to be a sustainable habitat providing for most
of its needs on site. However self-sufficiency is not always a goal or desired
outcome, specifically since self-sufficiency can conflict with goals to be a
change agent for the wider culture and infrastructure. Its organization also
usually depends upon some instructional capital or moral codes \- a minimal
civics sometimes characterized as eco-anarchism:

  * local purchasing so as to support the local economy;
  * local food production and distribution;
  * moral purchasing to avoid objectionable consumption;
  * consensus decision-making for governance;
  * a choice to respect diversity.

The term ecovillage should not be confused with micronation, a strictly legal,
not infrastructural, concept.
