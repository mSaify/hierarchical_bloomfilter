A parallel programming model is a set of software technologies to express
parallel algorithms and match applications with the underlying parallel
systems. It encloses the areas of applications, programming languages,
compilers, libraries, communications systems, and parallel I/O. Due to the
difficulties in automatic parallelization today, people have to choose a
proper parallel programming model or a form of mixture of them to develop
their parallel applications on a particular platform.

Parallel models are implemented in several ways: as libraries invoked from
traditional sequential languages, as language extensions, or complete new
execution models. They are also roughly categorized for two kinds of systems:
shared-memory system and distributed-memory system, though the lines between
them are largely blurred nowadays.

A programming model is usually judged by its expressibility and simplicity,
which are by all means conflicting factors. The ultimate goal is to improve
productivity of programming.
