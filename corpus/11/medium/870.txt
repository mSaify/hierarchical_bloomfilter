### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search

Planetary engineering is the application of technology for the purpose of
influencing the global properties of a planet.[1] The goal of this theoretical
task is usually to make other worlds habitable for life.

Perhaps the best-known type of planetary engineering is terraforming, by which
a planet's surface conditions are altered to be more like those of Earth.
Other types of planetary engineering include ecopoiesis, the introduction of
an ecology to a lifeless environment. Planetary engineering is largely the
realm of science fiction at present, although some types of climate change on
Earth are recent evidence that humans can cause change on a global scale.

## [edit] Terraforming

Main article: terraforming

Terraforming is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying the
atmosphere, temperature, or ecology of a planet, moon, or other body to be
similar to those of Earth in order to make it habitable by humans.

## [edit] Geoengineering

Main article: Geoengineering

Geoengineering is the application of planetary engineering techniques to
Earth. Recent geoengineering proposals have principally been methods to tackle
human-induced climate change by either removing carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere (e.g. using ocean iron fertilisation) or by managing solar
radiation (e.g. by using mirrors in space) in order to negate the net warming
effect of climate change.
