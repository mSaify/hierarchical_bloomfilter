## [edit] Introduction

A card-based transaction typically travels from a transaction acquiring
device, such as a point-of-sale terminal or an ATM, through a series of
networks, to a card issuing system for authorization against the card holder's
account. The transaction data contains information derived from the card
(e.g., the account number), the terminal (e.g., the merchant number), the
transaction (e.g., the amount), together with other data which may be
generated dynamically or added by intervening systems. The card issuing system
will either authorize or decline the transaction and generate a response
message which must be delivered back to the terminal in a timely manner.

ISO 8583 defines a message format and a communication flow so that different
systems can exchange these transactions. The vast majority of transactions
made at Automated Teller Machines use ISO 8583 at some point in the
communication chain, as do transactions made when a customer uses a card to
make a payment in a store. In particular, both the MasterCard and Visa
networks base their authorization communications on the ISO 8583 standard, as
do many other institutions and networks.

Cardholder-originated transactions include purchase, withdrawal, deposit,
refund, reversal, balance inquiry, payments and inter-account transfers. ISO
8583 also defines system-to-system messages for secure key exchanges,
reconciliation of totals, and other administrative purposes.

Although ISO 8583 defines a common standard, it is not typically used directly
by systems or networks. Instead, each network adapts the standard for its own
use with custom fields and custom usages.

The placement of fields in different versions of the standard varies; for
example, the currency elements of the 1987 and 1993 versions are no longer
used in the 2003 version, which holds currency as a sub-element of any
financial amount element. As of writing, ISO 8583:2003 has yet to achieve wide
acceptance.

An ISO 8583 message is made of the following parts:

  * Message Type Indicator (MTI)
  * One or more bitmaps, indicating which data elements are present
  * Data elements, the fields of the message

## [edit] Message Type Indicator (MTI)

This is a 4 digit numeric field which classifies the high level function of
the message. A Message Type Indicator includes the ISO 8583 version, the
Message Class, the Message Function and the Message Origin, each described
briefly in the following sections.

example :

## [edit] 0110

    
      0xxx -> version of ISO 8583 (1987 version)
      x1xx -> class of the Message (Authorization Message)
      xx1x -> function of the Message (Request Response)
      xxx0 -> who began the communication (Acquirer)
    
  

  

### [edit] ISO 8583 Version

Position one of the MTI specifies the versions of the ISO 8583 standard which
is being used to transmit the message.

Position Meaning  
0xxx ISO 8583-1:1987 version  
1xxx ISO 8583-2:1993 version  
2xxx ISO 8583-1:2003 version  
9xxx Private usage  
### [edit] Message Class

Position two of the MTI specifies the overall purpose of the message.

Position Meaning Usage  
x1xx Authorization Message Determine if funds are available, get an approval
but do not post to account for reconciliation, Dual Message System (DMS),
awaits file exchange for posting to account  
x2xx Financial Message Determines if funds are available, get an approval and
post directly to the account, Single Message System (SMS), no file exchange
after this  
x3xx File Actions Message Used for hot-card, TMS and other exchanges  
x4xx Reversal Message Reverses the action of a previous authorization  
x5xx Reconciliation Message Transmits settlement information  
x6xx Administrative Message Transmits administrative advice. Often used for
failure messages (e.g. message reject or failure to apply)  
x7xx Fee Collection Message  
x8xx Network Management Message Used for secure key exchange, logon, echo test
and other network functions  
x9xx Reserved by ISO  
### [edit] Message Function

Position three of the MTI specifies the message function which defines how the
message should flow within the system. Requests are end-to-end messages (e.g.,
from acquirer to issuer and back with timeouts and automatic reversals in
place), while advices are point-to-point messages (eg, from terminal to
acquirer, from acquirer to network, from network to issuer, with transmission
guaranteed over each link, but not necessarily immediately).

Position Meaning  
xx0x Request  
xx1x Request Response  
xx2x Advice  
xx3x Advice Response  
xx4x Notification  
xx8x Response acknowledgment  
xx9x Negative acknowledgment  
### [edit] Message Origin

Position four of the MTI defines the location of the message source within the
payment chain.

Position Meaning  
xxx0 Acquirer  
xxx1 Acquirer Repeat  
xxx2 Issuer  
xxx3 Issuer Repeat  
xxx4 Other  
xxx5 Other Repeat  
### [edit] Examples

Bearing each of the above four positions in mind, an MTI will completely
specify what a message should do, and how it is to be transmitted around the
network. Unfortunately, not all ISO 8583 implementations interpret the meaning
of an MTI in the same way. However, a few MTIs are relatively standard:

MTI Meaning Usage  
0100 Authorization request Request from a point-of-sale terminal for
authorization for a cardholder purchase  
0120 Authorization Advice When the Point of Sale device breaks down and you
have to sign a voucher  
0121 Authorisation Advice Repeat if the advice times out  
0200 Acquirer Financial Request Request for funds, typically from an ATM  
0220 Acquirer Financial Advice e.g. Checkout at a hotel  
0221 Acquirer Financial Advice repeat if the advice times out  
0400 Acquirer Reversal Request Reverses a transaction  
0420 Acquirer Reversal Advice Advises that a reversal has taken place  
0421 Acquirer Reversal Advice Repeat Message if the reversal times out  
0800 Network Management Request Echo test, logon, log off etc  
0820 Network Management Advice Keychange  
## [edit] Bitmaps

Within ISO 8583, a bitmap is a field or subfield within a message which
indicates which other data elements or data element subfields may be present
elsewhere in a message.

A message will contain at least one bitmap, called the Primary Bitmap which
indicates which of Data Elements 1 to 64 are present. A secondary bitmap may
also be present, generally as data element one and indicates which of data
elements 65 to 128 are present. Similarly, a tertiary, or third, bitmap can be
used to indicate the presence or absence of fields 129 to 192, although these
data elements are rarely used.

The bitmap may be transmitted as 8 bytes of binary data, or as 16 hexadecimal
characters 0-9, A-F in the ASCII or EBCDIC character sets.

A field is present when the specific bit in the bitmap is true, i.e. byte '82x
is binary '1000 0010' which means fields 1 and 7 are present in the message

## [edit] Data Elements

Data Elements are the individual fields carrying the transaction information.
There are up to 128 data elements specified in the original ISO 8583:1987
standard, and up to 192 data elements in later releases. The 1993 revision
added new definitions, deleted some, while leaving the message format itself
unchanged.

While each data element has a specified meaning and format, the standard also
includes some general purpose data elements and system- or country-specific
data elements which vary enormously in use and form from implementation to
implementation.

Each data element is described in a standard format which defines the
permitted content of the field (numeric, binary, etc) and the field length
(variable or fixed), according to the following table:

Abbreviation Meaning  
a Alpha, including blanks  
n Numeric values only  
s Special characters only  
an Alphanumeric  
as Alpha & special characters only  
ns Numeric and special characters only  
ans Alphabetic, numeric and special characters.  
b Binary data  
z Tracks 2 and 3 code set as defined in ISO 4909 and ISO/IEC 7813  
. or .. or ... variable field length indicator, each . indicating a digit.  
x or xx or xxx fixed length of field or maximum length in the case of variable
length fields.  
Additionally, each field may be either fixed or variable length. If variable,
the length of the field will be preceded by a length indicator.

Type Meaning  
Fixed no field length used  
LLVAR or (..xx) Where LL < 100, means two leading digits LL specify the field
length of field VAR  
LLLVAR or (...xxx) Where LLL < 1000, means three leading digits LLL specify
the field length of field VAR  
LL and LLL are hex or ASCII. A VAR field can be compressed or ASCII depending
of the data element type. LL can be 1 or 2 bytes. For example, if compressed
as one hex byte, '27x means there are 27 VAR bytes to follow. If ASCII, the
two bytes '32x, '37x mean there are 27 bytes to follow. 3 digit field length
LLL uses 2 bytes with a leading '0' nibble if compressed, or 3 bytes if ASCII.
The format of a VAR data element depends on the data element type. If numeric
it will be compressed, e.g. 87456 will be represented by 3 hex bytes '087456x.
If ASCII then one byte for each digit or character is used, e.g. '38x, '37x,
'34x, '35x, '36x.
