DES is now considered insecure because a brute force attack is possible (see
EFF DES cracker). As of 2008, the best analytical attack is linear
cryptanalysis, which requires 243 known plaintexts and has a time complexity
of 239â43 (Junod, 2001); under a chosen-plaintext assumption, the data
complexity can be reduced by a factor of four (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000).  
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher (a method for encrypting
information) that was selected by NBS as an official Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1976 and which has
subsequently enjoyed widespread use internationally. It is based on a
Symmetric-key algorithm that uses a 56-bit key. The algorithm was initially
controversial with classified design elements, a relatively short key length,
and suspicions about a National Security Agency (NSA) backdoor. DES
consequently came under intense academic scrutiny which motivated the modern
understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.

DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. This is chiefly
due to the 56-bit key size being too small; in January, 1999, distributed.net
and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES
key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see chronology). There are also some
analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher,
although they are unfeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed
to be practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are
theoretical attacks. In recent years, the cipher has been superseded by the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

In some documentation, a distinction is made between DES as a standard and DES
the algorithm which is referred to as the DEA (the Data Encryption Algorithm).
When spoken, "DES" is either spelled out (IPA: /diË iË És/) as an
abbreviation or pronounced as a single syllable (IPA: /dÉs/) acronym.

## [edit] History of DES

The origins of DES go back to the early 1970s. In 1972, after concluding a
study on the US government's computer security needs, the US standards body
NBS (National Bureau of Standards) â now named NIST (National Institute of
Standards and Technology) â identified a need for a government-wide standard
for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.[1] Accordingly, on 15 May
1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that
would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions, however, turned
out to be suitable. A second request was issued on 27 August 1974. This time,
IBM submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable â a cipher developed
during the period 1973â1974 based on an earlier algorithm, Horst Feistel's
Lucifer cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis
included Feistel, Walter Tuchman, Don Coppersmith, Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer,
Mike Matyas, Roy Adler, Edna Grossman, Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and Bryant
Tuckerman.

### [edit] NSA's involvement in the design

On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the Federal Register.
Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops
were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was some criticism from
various parties, including from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin
Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, citing a shortened key length and the mysterious
"S-boxes" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was
that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so
that they â but no-one else â could easily read encrypted
messages.[citation needed] Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES)
commented, "We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all
different."[2] The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper
involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978,
the Committee wrote:

    "In the development of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced key size was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness."[3]
However, it also found that

    "NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invented and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the DES was intended."[4]
Another member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, is quoted as saying, "We
developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not
dictate a single wire!"[5] In contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic
history states:

    "In 1973 NBS solicited private industry for a data encryption standard (DES). The first offerings were disappointing, so NSA began working on its own algorithm. Then Howard Rosenblum, deputy director for research and engineering, discovered that Walter Tuchman of IBM was working on a modification to Lucifer for general use. NSA gave Tuchman a clearance and brought him in to work jointly with the Agency on his Lucifer modification."[6]
Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in
1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by Eli Biham and Adi
Shamir of differential cryptanalysis, a general method for breaking block
ciphers. The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if
they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the
technique back in the 1970s. This was indeed the case â in 1994, Don
Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes.[7]
According to Steven Levy, IBM Watson researchers discovered differential
cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique
secret.[8] Coppersmith explains IBM's secrecy decision by saying, "that was
because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool, used against
many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain
could adversely affect national security." Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: "[t]hey
asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number
on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S.
government classified. They said do it. So I did it".[9]

### [edit] The algorithm as a standard

Despite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November
1976, and published on 15 January 1977 as FIPS PUB 46, authorized for use on
all unclassified data. It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983,
1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-46-2), and again in 1999 (FIPS-46-3),
the latter prescribing "Triple DES" (see below). On 26 May 2002, DES was
finally superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), following a
public competition. On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but
NIST has approved Triple DES through the year 2030 for sensitive government
information.[10]

The algorithm is also specified in ANSI X3.92[11], NIST SP 800-67[10] and
ISO/IEC 18033-3[12] (as a component of TDEA).

Another theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994, but
it was a brute force attack in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be
attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement
algorithm. These and other methods of cryptanalysis are discussed in more
detail later in the article.

The introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic
study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers.
According to a NIST retrospective about DES,

    The DES can be said to have "jump started" the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms. In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations, and little academic study of cryptography. There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial information security companies and consultants. A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is trying to "crack") the DES algorithm. In the words of cryptographer Bruce Schneier,[13] "DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study." An astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the DES, and the DES is the standard against which every symmetric key algorithm since has been compared.[14]

## [edit] Replacement algorithms

Concerns about security and the relatively slow operation of DES in software
motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative block cipher
designs, which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s: examples
include RC5, Blowfish, IDEA, NewDES, SAFER, CAST5 and FEAL. Most of these
designs kept the 64-bit block size of DES, and could act as a "drop-in"
replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key. In the USSR
the GOST 28147-89 algorithm was introduced, with a 64-bit block size and a
256-bit key, which was also used in Russia later.

DES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES
users now use Triple DES (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of
DES's patentees (see FIPS Pub 46-3); it involves applying DES three times with
two (2TDES) or three (3TDES) different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately
secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive
alternative is DES-X, which increases the key size by XORing extra key
material before and after DES. GDES was a DES variant proposed as a way to
speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential
cryptanalysis.

In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher, the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), as a replacement. The algorithm which was
selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name Rijndael.
Other finalists in the NIST AES competition included RC6, Serpent, MARS and
Twofish.

## [edit] Description

<IMG>

<IMG>

Figure 1 â The overall Feistel structure of DES

    For brevity, the following description omits the exact transformations and permutations which specify the algorithm; for reference, the details can be found in DES supplementary material.
DES is the archetypal block cipher â an algorithm that takes a fixed-length
string of plaintext bits and transforms it through a series of complicated
operations into another ciphertext bitstring of the same length. In the case
of DES, the block size is 64 bits. DES also uses a key to customize the
transformation, so that decryption can supposedly only be performed by those
who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64
bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits
are used solely for checking parity, and are thereafter discarded. Hence the
effective key length is 56 bits, and it is usually quoted as such.

Like other block ciphers, DES by itself is not a secure means of encryption
but must instead be used in a mode of operation. FIPS-81 specifies several
modes for use with DES.[16] Further comments on the usage of DES are contained
in FIPS-74.[17]

### [edit] Overall structure

The algorithm's overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical
stages of processing, termed rounds. There is also an initial and final
permutation, termed IP and FP, which are inverses (IP "undoes" the action of
FP, and vice versa). IP and FP have almost no cryptographic significance, but
were apparently included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of
mid-1970s hardware, as well as to make DES run slower in software.

Before the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and
processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the Feistel scheme. The
Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar
processes â the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the
reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This
greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no
need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.

The \\oplus symbol denotes the exclusive-OR (XOR) operation. The F-function
scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the
F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves
are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are not
swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and
decryption similar processes.

### [edit] The Feistel (F) function

The F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a
time and consists of four stages:

<IMG>

<IMG>

Figure 2 âThe Feistel function (F-function) of DES

  1. Expansion â the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the expansion permutation, denoted E in the diagram, by duplicating some of the bits.
  2. Key mixing â the result is combined with a subkey using an XOR operation. Sixteen 48-bit subkeys â one for each round â are derived from the main key using the key schedule (described below).
  3. Substitution â after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the S-boxes, or substitution boxes. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a lookup table. The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES â without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.
  4. Permutation â finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed permutation, the P-box.

The alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from
the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called "confusion and diffusion"
respectively, a concept identified by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a
necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.

### [edit] Key schedule

<IMG>

<IMG>

Figure 3 â The key-schedule of DES

Figure 3 illustrates the key schedule for encryption â the algorithm which
generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the
initial 64 by Permuted Choice 1 (PC-1) â the remaining eight bits are either
discarded or used as parity check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two
28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive
rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each
round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by Permuted Choice 2 (PC-2) â
24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by
"<<<" in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each
subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.

The key schedule for decryption is similar â the subkeys are in reverse
order compared to encryption. Apart from that change, the process is the same
as for encryption.

## [edit] Security and cryptanalysis

Although more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than
any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute
force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three
theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity
less than a brute force attack, require an unrealistic amount of known or
chosen plaintext to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.

### [edit] Brute force attack

For any cipher, the most basic method of attack is brute force â trying
every possible key in turn. The length of the key determines the number of
possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions
were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was
adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical
cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. It is known
that the NSA encouraged, if not persuaded, IBM to reduce the key size from 128
to 64 bits, and from there to 56 bits; this is often taken as an indication
that the NSA thought it would be able to break keys of this length even in the
mid-1970s.

<IMG>

<IMG>

The EFF's US$250,000 DES cracking machine contained 1,856 custom chips and
could brute force a DES key in a matter of days â the photo shows a DES
Cracker circuit board fitted with several Deep Crack chips.

In academia, various proposals for a DES-cracking machine were advanced. In
1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million
which could find a DES key in a single day. By 1993, Wiener had proposed a
key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours.
However, none of these early proposals were ever implementedâor, at least,
no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was
practically demonstrated in the late 1990s. In 1997, RSA Security sponsored a
series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a
message encrypted with DES for the contest. That contest was won by the
DESCHALL Project, led by Rocke Verser, Matt Curtin, and Justin Dolske, using
idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet. The feasibility of
cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was
built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights
group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see EFF DES cracker). Their
motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in
theory: "There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see
it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in
a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot
trust their security to DES." The machine brute-forced a key in a little more
than 2 days search.

<IMG>

<IMG>

The COPACOBANA machine, built for US$10,000 by the Universities of Bochum and
Kiel, Germany, contains 120 low-cost FPGAs and can perform an exhaustive key
search on DES in 6.4 days on average. The photo shows the backplane of the
machine with the FPGAs.

The only other confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine (abbreviation
of cost-optimized parallel code breaker) built more recently by teams of the
Universities of Bochum and Kiel, both in Germany. Unlike the EFF machine,
COPACOBANA consist of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated
circuits. 120 of these Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) of type XILINX
Spartan3-1000 run in parallel. They are grouped in 20 DIMM modules, each
containing 6 FPGAs. The use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine
applicable to other code breaking tasks as well. The figure shows a full-sized
COPACOBANA. One of the more interesting aspects of COPACOBANA is its cost
factor. One machine can be built for approximately $10,000. The cost decrease
by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an impressive example for
the continuous improvement of digital hardware. Adjusting for inflation over 8
years yields an even higher improvement of about 30x. Interestingly Moore's
law predicts an improvement of about 32, since about 8 years have passed
between the design of the two machines, which allows for about five doublings
of computer power (or 5 reductions by 50% of the cost for doing the same
computation).

### [edit] Attacks faster than brute-force

There are three attacks known that can break the full sixteen rounds of DES
with less complexity than a brute-force search: differential cryptanalysis
(DC), linear cryptanalysis (LC), and Davies' attack. However, the attacks are
theoretical and are unfeasible to mount in practice; these types of attack are
sometimes termed certificational weaknesses.

  * Differential cryptanalysis was rediscovered in the late 1980s by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir; it was known earlier to both IBM and the NSA and kept secret. To break the full 16 rounds, differential cryptanalysis requires 247 chosen plaintexts. DES was designed to be resistant to DC.
  * Linear cryptanalysis was discovered by Mitsuru Matsui, and needs 243 known plaintexts (Matsui, 1993); the method was implemented (Matsui, 1994), and was the first experimental cryptanalysis of DES to be reported. There is no evidence that DES was tailored to be resistant to this type of attack. A generalisation of LC â multiple linear cryptanalysis â was suggested in 1994 (Kaliski and Robshaw), and was further refined by Biryukov et al (2004); their analysis suggests that multiple linear approximations could be used to reduce the data requirements of the attack by at least a factor of 4 (i.e. 241 instead of 243). A similar reduction in data complexity can be obtained in a chosen-plaintext variant of linear cryptanalysis (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000). Junod (2001) performed several experiments to determine the actual time complexity of linear cryptanalysis, and reported that it was somewhat faster than predicted, requiring time equivalent to 239â241 DES evaluations.
  * Improved Davies' attack: while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes, Davies' attack is a specialised technique for DES, first suggested by Donald Davies in the eighties, and improved by Biham and Biryukov (1997). The most powerful form of the attack requires 250 known plaintexts, has a computational complexity of 250, and has a 51% success rate.

There have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the
cipher, i.e. versions of DES with fewer than sixteen rounds. Such analysis
gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a
"security margin" the full version retains. Differential-linear cryptanalysis
was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and
linear cryptanalysis into a single attack. An enhanced version of the attack
can break 9-round DES with 215.8 known plaintexts and has a 229.2 time
complexity (Biham et al, 2002).

### [edit] Minor cryptanalytic properties

DES exhibits the complementation property, namely that

    E_K\(P\)=C \\Leftrightarrow E_\\overline{K}\(\\overline{P}\)=\\overline{C}
where \\overline{x} is the bitwise complement of x. EK denotes encryption with
key K. P and C denote plaintext and ciphertext blocks respectively. The
complementation property means that the work for a brute force attack could be
reduced by a factor of 2 (or a single bit) under a chosen-plaintext
assumption.

DES also has four so-called weak keys. Encryption (E) and decryption (D) under
a weak key have the same effect (see involution):

    EK(EK(P)) = P or equivalently, EK = DK
There are also six pairs of semi-weak keys. Encryption with one of the pair of
semiweak keys, K1, operates identically to decryption with the other, K2:

    E_{K_1}\(E_{K_2}\(P\)\) = P or equivalently, E_{K_2} = D_{K_1}.
It is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation,
either by testing for them explicitly, or simply by choosing keys randomly;
the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible. The keys
are not really any weaker than any other keys anyway, as they do not give an
attack any advantage.

DES has also been proved not to be a group, or more precisely, the set {EK}
(for all possible keys K) under functional composition is not a group, nor
"close" to being a group (Campbell and Wiener, 1992). This was an open
question for some time, and if it had been the case, it would have been
possible to break DES, and multiple encryption modes such as Triple DES would
not increase the security.

It is known that the maximum cryptographic security of DES is limited to about
64 bits, even when independently choosing all round subkeys instead of
deriving them from a key, which would otherwise permit a security of 768 bits.
