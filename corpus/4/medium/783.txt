The 1920s is sometimes referred to as the Roaring Twenties or the Jazz Age,
when speaking about the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom. In Europe
the decade is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Twenties". Since the
closing of the 20th century, the economic strength during the 1920s has drawn
close associations with the 1950s and 1990s, especially in the United States.
These three decades are regarded as periods of economic prosperity, which
lasted throughout almost the entire decades following a tremendous event that
occurred in the previous decade (World War I and Spanish flu in the 1910s,
World War II in the 1940s, and the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s).

However, not all countries enjoyed this prosperity. The Weimar Republic, like
many other European countries, had to face a severe economic downturn in the
opening years of the decade, because of the enormous debt caused by the war as
well as the Treaty of Versailles. Such a crisis would culminate with a
devaluation of the Mark in 1923, eventually leading to severe economic
problems and, in the long term, favour the rise of the Nazi Party.

Additionally, the decade was characterized by the rise of radical political
movements, especially in regions that were once part of empires. Communism
began attracting large numbers of followers following the success of the
October Revolution and the Bolsheviks' determination to win the subsequent
Russian Civil War. The Bolsheviks would eventually adopt a policy of mixed
economics, from 1921 to 1928, and also give birth to the USSR, at the end of
1922. The twenties marked the first time in America that the population in the
cities surpassed the population of rural areas. This was due to rapid
urbanization starting in the 1920s.

The 1920s also experienced the rise of the far-right and fascism in Europe and
elsewhere, being perceived as a solution to prevent the spread of Communism.
The knotty economic problems also favoured the rise of dictatorships in
Eastern Europe and the Balkans, such as JÃ³zef PiÅsudski in Poland and Peter
and Alexander KaraÄorÄeviÄ of Yugoslavia. The Stock Market collapsed during
October 1929 (see Black Tuesday) and drew a line under the prosperous 1920s.

  * Benito Mussolini of the National Fascist Party became Italy's Prime Minister, shortly thereafter creating the world's first fascist government. The Fascist regime establishes a totalitarian state led by Mussolini as a dictator. The Fascist regime restores good relations between the Roman Catholic Church and Italy with the Lateran Pact which creates Vatican City. The Fascist regime pursues an expansionist agenda in Europe such as by raiding the Greek island of Corfu in 1923, pressuring Albania to submit to becoming a de facto Italian protectorate in the mid-1920s, and threatening Yugoslavia with war until the Yugoslav government agrees to allow Italians to freely immigrate into Dalmatia (a region of Yugoslavia claimed by Italian nationalists) with the Treaty of Nettuno.
  * Germany suffers from economic crisis in the early 1920s and hyperinflation of currency in 1923. French military forces briefly occupy the industrial Ruhr region in Germany from 1923 to 1924 after Germany failed to be able to pay its reparations payments. The recently-formed fringe National Socialist German Workers' Party (a.k.a. Nazi Party) led by Adolf Hitler attempts a coup against the Bavarian and German governments in the Beer Hall Putsch which fails, resulting in Hitler being briefly imprisoned for one year in prison where he writes Mein Kampf.
