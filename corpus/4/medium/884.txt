British Raj (rÄj (à¤°à¤¾à¤ Ø±Ø§Ø¬), lit. "reign" in Hindustani[1]) primarily
refers to the British rule in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and
1947;[2] it can also refer to the period of dominion, and even the region
under the rule.[3] The region, commonly called India in contemporary usage,
included areas directly administered by the United Kingdom,[4] as well as the
princely states ruled by individual rulers under the paramountcy of the
British Crown. After 1876, the resulting political union was officially called
the Indian Empire and issued passports under that name. As India, it was a
founding member of the League of Nations, the United Nations, and a member
nation of the Summer Olympics in 1900, 1920, 1928, 1932, and 1936.

The system of governance was instituted in 1858, when the rule of the British
East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen
Victoria (and who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India), and lasted until
1947, when the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two sovereign
dominion states, the Union of India (later the Republic of India) and the
Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the eastern half
of which, still later, became the People's Republic of Bangladesh). The
eastern part of the Indian Empire became the separate colony of Burma in 1937,
and this gained independence in 1948.

## [edit] Geographical extent of the Raj

<IMG>

<IMG>

The British Indian Empire and surrounding countries in 1909.

The British Raj extended over all regions of present-day India, Pakistan, and
Bangladesh. In addition, at various times, it included Aden Colony (from 1858
to 1937), Lower Burma (from 1858 to 1937), Upper Burma (from 1886 to 1937),
British Somaliland (briefly from 1884 to 1898), and Singapore (briefly from
1858 to 1867). Burma was directly administered by the British Crown from 1937
until its independence in 1948. The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf were
theoretically princely states of British India until 1946 and used the rupee
as their unit of currency.

Among other countries in the region, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), was ceded to the
United Kingdom in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens. Ceylon was a British Crown
Colony, but not part of British India. The kingdoms of Nepal and Bhutan,
having fought wars with the British, subsequently signed treaties with them,
were recognized by the British as independent states.[5][6] The Kingdom of
Sikkim was established as a princely state after the Anglo-Sikkimese Treaty of
1861. However, the issue of sovereignty was left undefined.[7] The Maldive
Islands were a British protectorate from 1887 to 1965, but not part of British
India.

The British Indian Empire in 1893.

The British Indian Empire (contemporaneously India) consisted of two
divisions: British India and the Native States or Princely States. In its
Interpretation Act of 1889, the British Parliament adopted the following
definitions:[8]

> The expression British India shall mean all territories and places within
Her Majesty's dominions which are for the time being governed by Her Majesty
through the Governor-General of India, or through any Governor or other
officer subordinate to the Governor-General of India. The expression India
shall mean British India together with any territories of an Native Prince or
Chief under the suzerainty of Her Majesty, exercised through the Governor-
General of India, or through any Governor or other officer subordinate to the
Governor-General of India. (52 & 53 Vict. cap. 63, sec. 18)

(It should be noted that in general the term "British India" had been used
(and is still used) to also refer to the regions under the rule of the British
East India Company in India from 1600 to 1858.[9] The term has also been used
to refer to the "British in India."[10])

Suzerainty over 175 Princely States, some of the largest and most important,
was exercised (in the name of the British Crown) by central government of
British India under the Viceroy; the remaining, approximately 500, states were
dependents of the provincial governments of British India under a Governor,
Lieutenant-Governor, or Chief Commissioner (as the case might have been).[11]
A clear distinction between "dominion" and "suzerainty" was supplied by the
jurisdiction of the courts of law: the law of British India rested upon the
laws passed by the British Parliament and the legislative powers those laws
vested in the various governments of British India, both central and local; in
contrast, the courts of the Princely States existed under the authority of the
respective rulers of those states.[11]

### [edit] Major Provinces

At the turn of the 20th century, British India consisted of eight provinces
that were administered either by a Governor or a Lieutenant-Governor. The
following table lists their areas and populations (but does not include those
of the dependent Native States):[12] During the partition of Bengal
(1905â1911), a new province, Assam and East Bengal was created as a
Lieutenant-Governorship. In 1911, East Bengal was reunited with Bengal, and
the new provinces in the east became: Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.[12]

### [edit] Native states or Princely states

Main article: Princely state

A Princely State, also called Native State or Indian State, was a nominally
sovereign entity of British rule in India that was not directly governed by
the British, but rather by an Indian ruler under a form of indirect rule such
as suzerainty or paramountcy. Military, foreign affairs and communications
power were under British control. There were 565 princely states when the
Indian subcontinent became independent from Britain in August 1947.[14]

Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Act for the Better Government of
India (1858) made changes in the governance of India at three levels: in the
imperial government in London, in the central government in Calcutta, and in
the provincial governments in the presidencies (and later in the
provinces).[15]

In London, it provided for a cabinet-level Secretary of State for India and a
fifteen-member Council of India, whose members were required, as one
prerequisite of membership, to have spent at least ten years in India and to
have done so no more than ten years before.[16] Although the Secretary of
State formulated the policy instructions to be communicated to India, he was
required in most instances to consult the Council, but especially so in
matters relating to spending of Indian revenues.[15] The Act envisaged a
system of "double government" in which the Council ideally served both as a
check on excesses in imperial policy-making and as a body of up-to-date
expertise on India.[15] However, the Secretary of State also had special
emergency powers that allowed him to make unilateral decisions, and, in
reality, the Council's expertise was sometimes outdated.[17] From 1858 until
1947, twenty seven individuals would serve as Secretary of State for India and
direct the India Office; these included: Sir Charles Wood (1859 - 1866),
Marquess of Salisbury (1874 - 1878) (later three-time Prime Minister of
Britain), John Morley (1905 - 1910) (initiator of the Minto-Morley Reforms),
E. S. Montagu (1917 - 1922) (an architect of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms),
and Frederick Pethick-Lawrence (1945 - 1947) (head of the 1946 Cabinet Mission
to India). The size of the advisory Council would be reduced over the next
half-century, but its powers would remain unchanged; in 1907, for the first
time, two Indians would be appointed to the Council.[18]

In Calcutta, the Governor-General remained head of the Government of India and
now was more commonly called the Viceroy on account of his secondary role as
the Crown's representative to the nominally sovereign princely states; he was,
however, now responsible to the Secretary of State in London and through him
to British Parliament. A system of "double government" had already been in
place in the East India Company rule in India from the time of Pitt's India
Act of 1784.[18] The Governor-General in the capital, Calcutta, and the
Governor in a subordinate presidency (Madras or Bombay) was each required to
consult his advisory council; executive orders in Calcutta, for example, were
issued in the name of "Governor-General-in-Council" (i.e.the Governor-General
with the advice of the Council).[18] The Company's system of "double
government" had its critics, since, from the time of the system's inception,
there had been been intermittent feuding between the Governor-General and his
Council; still, the Act of 1858 made no major changes in governance[18]
However, in the years immediately thereafter, which were also the years of
post-rebellion reconstruction, the Viceroy Lord Canning found the collective
decision-making of the Council to be too time-consuming for the pressing tasks
ahead.[18] He therefore requested the "portfolio system" of an Executive
Council in which the business of each government department (the "portfolio")
was assigned to and became the responsibility of a single Council member.[18]
Routine departmental decisions were made exclusively by the member, however,
important decisions required the consent of the Governor-General and, in the
absence such consent, required discussion by the entire Executive Council.
This innovation in Indian governance was promulgated in the Indian Councils
Act of 1861.

If the Government of India needed to enact new laws, the Councils Act allowed
for a Legislative Councilâan expansion of the Executive Council by up to
twelve additional members, each appointed to a two-year termâwith half the
members consisting of British officials of the government (termed official)
and allowed to vote, and the other half, comprising Indians and domiciled
Britons in India (termed non-official) and serving only in an advisory
capacity.[19] All laws enacted by Legislative Councils in India, whether by
the Imperial Legislative Council in Calcutta or by the provincial ones in
Madras and Bombay, required the final assent of the Secretary of State in
London; this prompted Sir Charles Wood, the second Secretary of State, to
describe the Government of India as "a despotism controlled from home."[20]
Moreover, although the appointment of Indians to the Legislative Council was a
response to calls after the 1857 rebellion, most notably by Sir Sayyid Ahmad
Khan, for more consultation with Indians, the Indians so appointed were from
the landed aristocracy, often chosen for their loyalty, and far from
representative.[21] Even so, the "tiny advances in the practise of
representative government were intended to provide safety valves for the
expression of public opinion which had been so badly misjudged before the
rebellion." (Bayly 1990, p. 195). Indian affairs now also came to be more
closely examined in the British parliament and more widely discussed in the
British press.[22]

Although the Great Uprising of 1857 had shaken the British enterprise in
India, it had not derailed it. After the rebellion, the British became more
circumspect. Much thought was devoted to the causes of the rebellion, and from
it three main lessons were drawn. At a more practical level, it was felt that
there needed to be more communication and camaraderie between the British and
Indians; not just between British army officers and their Indian staff, but in
civilian life as well. The Indian army was completely reorganised: units
composed of the Muslims and Brahmins of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh,
who had formed the core of the rebellion, were disbanded.[23] New regiments,
like the Sikhs and Baluchis, composed of Indians who, in British estimation,
had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was
to remain unchanged in its organization until 1947.[24] In 1880 the standing
Indian Army consisted of 66,000 British soldiers, 130,000 Natives, and 350,000
soldiers in the princely armies.[25]

It was also felt that both the princes and the large land-holders, by not
joining the rebellion, had proved to be, in Lord Canning's words, "breakwaters
in a storm."[23] They too were rewarded in the new British Raj, by being
officially recognised in the treaties each state now signed with the
Crown.[24] At the same time, it was felt that the peasants, for whose benefit
the large land-reforms of the United Provinces had been undertaken, had shown
disloyalty, by, in many cases, fighting for their former landlords against the
British. Consequently, no more land reforms were implemented for the next 90
years: Bengal and Bihar were to remain the realms of large land holdings
(unlike the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh).[24]

Lastly, the British felt disenchanted with Indian reaction to social change.
Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform,
like the ban on suttee by Lord William Bentinck.[23] It was now felt that
traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed
easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made,
especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British felt very
strongly about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child
widows).[24]

## [edit] Famines, epidemics and public health

Main articles: Famines, epidemics, and public health in the British Raj and
Timeline of major famines in India during British rule (1765 to 1947)

During the British Raj, India experienced some of the worst famines ever
recorded, including the Great Famine of 1876â78, in which 6.1 million to
10.3 million people died[26] and the Indian famine of 1899â1900, in which
1.25 to 10 million people died.[26] Recent research, including work by Mike
Davis and Amartya Sen,[27] attribute these famines directly to British policy
in India.

The first cholera pandemic began in Bengal, then spread across India by 1820.
10,000 British troops and countless Indians died during this pandemic.[28]
Deaths in India between 1817 and 1860 are estimated to have exceeded 15
million persons. Another 23 million died between 1865 and 1917.[29] The Third
Pandemic of plague started in China in the middle of the 19th century,
spreading disease to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in
India alone.[30] Waldemar Haffkine, who mainly worked in India, was the first
microbiologist who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic
plague. In 1925, the Plague Laboratory in Bombay was renamed the Haffkine
Institute.

Fevers had been considered one of the leading causes of death in India in the
19th century.[31] It was Britain's Sir Ronald Ross working in the Presidency
General Hospital in Calcutta who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is
transmitted by mosquitoes.[32] In 1881, around 120,000 leprosy patients
existed in India. The central government passed the Lepers Act of 1898, which
provided legal provision for forcible confinement of leprosy sufferers in
India.[33] Under the direction of Mountstuart Elphinstone a program was
launched to propagate smallpox vaccination.[34] Mass vaccination in India
resulted in a major decline in smallpox mortality by the end of the 19th
century.[35] In 1849 nearly 13% of all Calcutta deaths were due to
smallpox.[36] Between 1868 and 1907, there were approximately 4.7 million
deaths from smallpox.[37]

Sir Robert Grant directed his attention to the expediency of establishing a
systematic institution in the Bombay for imparting medical knowledge to the
natives.[38] In 1860, Grant Medical College became one of the four colleges
recognized by it for teaching courses leading to degrees (others being
Elphinstone College, Deccan College and Government Law College, Mumbai).

### [edit] Prelude: Company Rule in India

Main article: Company rule in India

Although the British East India Company had administered its factory areas in
Indiaâbeginning with Surat early in the 17th century, and including by the
century's end, Fort William near Calcutta, Fort St George in Madras and the
Bombay Castleâits victory in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the real
beginning of the Company rule in India. The victory was consolidated in 1764
at the Battle of Buxar (in Bihar), when the defeated Mughal emperor, Shah Alam
II, granted the Company the Diwani ("right to collect land-revenue") in
Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The Company soon expanded its territories around
its bases in Bombay and Madras: the Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766â1799) and the
Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772â1818) gave it control over most of India south of
the Narmada River.

Earlier, in 1773, the British Parliament granted regulatory control over East
India Company to the British government and established the post of Governor-
General of India, with Warren Hastings as the first incumbent.[39] In 1784,
the British Parliament passed Pitt's India Act which created a Board of
Control for overseeing the administration of East India Company. Hastings was
succeeded in 1784 by Cornwallis, who promulgated the 'Permanent Settlement of
Bengal' with the zamindars.

fell under the Ryotwari land revenue system.  
At the turn of the 19th century, Governor-General Wellesley began what became
two decades of accelerated expansion of Company territories.[40] This was
achieved either by subsidiary alliances between the Company and local rulers
or by direct military annexation. The subsidiary alliances created the
Princely States (or Native States) of the Hindu Maharajas and the Muslim
Nawabs, prominent among which were: Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794), Travancore
(1795), Hyderabad (1798), Mysore (1799), Cis-Sutlej Hill States (1815),
Central India Agency (1819), Kutch and Gujarat Gaikwad territories (1819),
Rajputana (1818), and Bahawalpur (1833).[40] The annexed regions included the
North Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur, and the Doab)
(1801), Delhi (1803), and Sindh (1843). Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province,
and Kashmir, were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849; however, Kashmir
was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra Dynasty
of Jammu, and thereby became a princely state. In 1854 Berar was annexed, and
the state of Oudh two years later.[40]

The East India Company also signed treaties with various Afghan rulers and
with Ranjit Singh of Lahore to counterbalance the Russian support of Persia's
plans in western Afghanistan. In 1839, the Company's effort to more actively
support Shah Shuja as Amir in Afghanistan, led to the First Afghan War
(1839-42) and resulted in a military disaster for it. As the British expanded
their territory in India, so did Russia in Central Asia with the taking of
Bukhara and Samarkand in 1863 and 1868 respectively, and thereby setting the
stage for The Great Game of Central Asia.[41]

In the Charter Act of 1813, the British parliament renewed the Company's
charter but terminated its monopoly, opening India to both private investment
and missionary work.[40] With increased British power in India, supervision of
Indian affairs by the British Crown and parliament increased as well; by the
1820s, British nationals could transact business under the protection of the
Crown in the three Company presidencies.[40] In the Charter Act of 1833, the
British parliament revoked the Company's trade license altogether, making the
Company a part of British governance, although the administration of British
India remained the province of Company officers.[42]

Starting in 1772, the Company began a series of land revenue "settlements,"
which would create major changes in landed rights and rural economy in India.
In 1793, the Governor-General Lord Cornwallis promulgated the permanent
settlement in the Bengal Presidency, the first socio-economic regulation in
colonial India.[43] It was named permanent because it fixed the land tax in
perpetuity in return for landed property rights for a class of intermediaries
called zamindars, who thereafter became owners of the land.[43] It was hoped
that knowledge of a fixed government demand would encourage the zamindars to
increase both their average outcrop and the land under cultivation, since they
would be able to retain the profits from the increased output; in addition,
the land itself would become a marketable form of property that could be
purchased, sold, or mortgaged.[44] However, the zamindars themselves were
often unable to meet the increased demands that the Company had placed on
them; consequently, many defaulted, and by one estimate, up to one-third of
their lands were auctioned during the first three decades following the
permanent settlement.[45] In southern India, Thomas Munro, who would later
become Governor of Madras, promoted the ryotwari system, in which the
government settled land-revenue directly with the peasant farmers, or
ryots.[44] Based on the utilitarian ideas of James Mill, who supervised the
Company's land revenue policy during 1819-1830, and David Ricardo's Law of
Rent, it was considered by its supporters to be both closer to traditional
practice and more progressive, allowing the benefits of Company rule to reach
the lowest levels of rural society.[44] However, in spite of the appeal of the
ryotwari system's abstract principles, class hierarchies in southern Indian
villages had not entirely disappearedâfor example village headmen continued
to hold swayâand peasant cultivators came to experience revenue demands they
could not meet.[46]

Land revenue settlements constituted a major administrative activity of the
various governments in India under Company rule.[47] In all areas other than
the Bengal Presidency, land settlement work involved a continually repetitive
process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and
recording landed rights, and constituted a large proportion of the work of
Indian Civil Service officers working for the government.[47] After the
Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of
government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th
century.[47] Since, in many regions, the land tax assessment could be revised,
and since it was generally computed at a high level, it created lasting
resentment which would later come to a head in the rebellion which rocked much
of North India in 1857.[48]

### [edit] Indian Rebellion of 1857

Main article: Indian Rebellion of 1857

The rebellion began with mutinies by sepoys of the Bengal Presidency army; in
1857 the presidency consisted of present-day Bangladesh, and the Indian states
of West Bengal, Bihar and UP. However, most rebel soldiers were from the UP
region, and, in particular, from Northwest Provinces (especially, Ganga-Jumna
Doab) and Oudh, and many came from landowning families.[49] Within weeks of
the initial mutiniesâas the rebel soldiers wrested control of many urban
garrisons from the Britishâthe rebellion was joined by various discontented
groups in the hinterlands, in both farmed areas and the backwoods. The latter
group, forming the civilian rebellion, consisted of feudal nobility,
landlords, peasants, rural merchants, and some tribal groups.[50]

After the annexation of Oudh by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys
were disquieted both from losing their perquisites as landed gentry in the
Oudh courts and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments
that the annexation might augur.[51] Some Indian soldiers, misreading the
presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were persuaded that the
East India Company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to
Christianity.[52] Changes in the terms of their professional service may also
have created resentment. As the extent of British jurisdiction expanded with
British victories in wars and with annexation of territory, the soldiers were
now not only expected to serve in less familiar regions (such as Lower Burma
after the Second Burmese War in 1852-53), but also make do without the
"foreign service," remuneration that had previously been their due.[53]

The civilian rebellion was more multifarious in origin. The rebels consisted
of three groups: feudal nobility, rural landlords called taluqdars, and the
peasants. The nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the
Doctrine of Lapse, which derecognised adopted children of princes as legal
heirs, felt that the British had interfered with a traditional system of
inheritance. Rebel leaders such as Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi belonged
to this group; the latter, for example, was prepared to accept British
paramountcy if her adopted son was recognized as the heir.[54] The second
group, the taluqdars had lost half their landed estates to peasant farmers as
a result of the land reforms that came in the wake of annexation of Oudh. As
the rebellion gained ground, the taluqdars quickly reoccupied the lands they
had lost, and paradoxically, in part due to ties of kinship and feudal
loyalty, did not experience significant opposition from the peasant farmers,
many of whom too now joined the rebellion to the great dismay of the
British.[55] Heavy land-revenue assessment in some areas by the British may
have resulted in many landowning families either losing their land or going
into great debt with money lenders, and providing ultimately a reason to
rebel; money lenders, in addition to the British, were particular objects of
the rebels' animosity.[56] The civilian rebellion was also highly uneven in
its geographic distribution, even in areas of north-central India that were no
longer under British control. For example, the relatively prosperous
Muzaffarnagar district, a beneficiary of a British irrigation scheme, and next
door to Meerut where the upheaval began, stayed mostly calm throughout.[57]

### [edit] Effects on economy

"A significant fact which stands out is that those parts of India which have
been longest under British rule are the poorest today. Indeed some kind of
chart might be drawn up to indicate the close connection between length of
British rule and progressive growth of poverty."  
â Jawaharlal Nehru, on the economic effects of the British rule, in his book
The Discovery of India[58]  
In the second half of the 19th century, both the direct administration of
India by the British crown and the technological change ushered in by the
industrial revolution, had the effect of closely intertwining the economies of
India and Great Britain.[59] In fact many of the major changes in transport
and communications (that are typically associated with Crown Rule of India)
had already begun before the Mutiny. Since Dalhousie had embraced the
technological change then rampant in Great Britain, India too saw rapid
development of all those technologies. Railways, roads, canals, and bridges
were rapidly built in India and telegraph links equally rapidly established in
order that raw materials, such as cotton, from India's hinterland could be
transported more efficiently to ports, such as Bombay, for subsequent export
to England.[60] Likewise, finished goods from England were transported back
just as efficiently, for sale in the burgeoning Indian markets.[61] However,
unlike Britain itself, where the market risks for the infrastructure
development were borne by private investors, in India, it was the
taxpayersâprimarily farmers and farm-labourersâwho endured the risks,
which, in the end, amounted to Â£50 million.[62] In spite of these costs, very
little skilled employment was created for Indians. By 1920, with the fourth
largest railway network in the world and a history of 60 years of its
construction, only ten per cent of the "superior posts" in the Indian Railways
were held by Indians.[63] The Indian railways system, by 1900, provided India
with social savings of 9% of India's national income (about 1.2 billion
rupees).[64]

The rush of technology was also changing the agricultural economy in India: by
the last decade of the 19th century, a large fraction of some raw
materialsânot only cotton, but also some food-grainsâwere being exported
to faraway markets.[65] Consequently, many small farmers, dependent on the
whims of those markets, lost land, animals, and equipment to money-
lenders..[65] More tellingly, the latter half of the 19th century also saw an
increase in the number of large-scale famines in India. Although famines were
not new to the subcontinent, these were particularly severe, with tens of
millions dying, and with many critics, both British and Indian, laying the
blame at the doorsteps of the lumbering colonial administrations.[66]

Taxes in India decreased during the colonial period for most of India's
population; with the land tax revenue claiming 15% of India's national income
during Mogul times compared with 1% at the end of the colonial period. The
percentage of national income for the village economy increased from 44%
during Mogul times to 54% by the end of colonial period. India's per capita
GDP decreased from $550 in 1700 to $520 by 1857, although it had increased to
$618 by 1947[67]

### [edit] Beginnings of self-government

The first steps were taken toward self-government in British India in the late
19th century with the appointment of Indian counsellors to advise the British
viceroy and the establishment of provincial councils with Indian members; the
British subsequently widened participation in legislative councils with the
Indian Councils Act of 1892. Municipal Corporations and District Boards were
created for local administration; they included elected Indian members.

The Government of India Act of 1909 â also known as the Morley-Minto Reforms
(John Morley was the secretary of state for India, and Gilbert Elliot, fourth
earl of Minto, was viceroy) â gave Indians limited roles in the central and
provincial legislatures, known as legislative councils. Indians had previously
been appointed to legislative councils, but after the reforms some were
elected to them. At the centre, the majority of council members continued to
be government-appointed officials, and the viceroy was in no way responsible
to the legislature. At the provincial level, the elected members, together
with unofficial appointees, outnumbered the appointed officials, but
responsibility of the governor to the legislature was not contemplated. Morley
made it clear in introducing the legislation to the British Parliament that
parliamentary self-government was not the goal of the British government.

The Morley-Minto Reforms were a milestone. Step by step, the elective
principle was introduced for membership in Indian legislative councils. The
"electorate" was limited, however, to a small group of upper-class Indians.
These elected members increasingly became an "opposition" to the "official
government". The Communal electorates were later extended to other communities
and made a political factor of the Indian tendency toward group identification
through religion.

### [edit] World War I and its aftermath

World War I would prove to be a watershed in the imperial relationship between
Britain and India. 1.4 million Indian and British soldiers of the British
Indian Army would take part in the war and their participation would have a
wider cultural fallout: news of Indian soldiers fighting and dying with
British soldiers, as well as soldiers from dominions like Canada and
Australia, would travel to distant corners of the world both in newsprint and
by the new medium of the radio.[68] Indiaâs international profile would
thereby rise and would continue to rise during the 1920s.[68] It was to lead,
among other things, to India, under its own name, becoming a founding member
of the League of Nations in 1920 and participating, under the name, "Les Indes
Anglaises" (The British Indies), in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp.[69]
Back in India, especially among the leaders of the Indian National Congress,
it would lead to calls for greater self-government for Indians.[68]

In 1916, in the face of new strength demonstrated by the moderate nationalists
with the signing of the Lucknow Pact and the founding of the Home Rule
leagues, and the realization, after the disaster in the Mesopotamian campaign,
that the war would likely last longer, the new Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford,
cautioned that the Government of India needed to be more responsive to Indian
opinion.[70] Towards the end of the year, after discussions with the
government in London, he suggested that the British demonstrate their good
faith â in light of the Indian war role â through a number of public
actions, including awards of titles and honors to princes, granting of
commissions in the army to Indians, and removal of the much-reviled cotton
excise duty, but most importantly, an announcement of Britain's future plans
for India and an indication of some concrete steps.[70] After more discussion,
in August 1917, the new Liberal Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu,
announced the British aim of âincreasing association of Indians in every
branch of the administration, and the gradual development of self-governing
institutions, with a view to the progressive realization of responsible
government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.â[70] Although
the plan envisioned limited self-government at first only in the provinces â
with India emphatically within the British Empire â it represented the first
British proposal for any form of representative government in a non-white
colony.[70]

Earlier, at the onset of World War I, the reassignment of most of the British
army in India to Europe and Mesopotamia had led the previous Viceroy, Lord
Harding, to worry about the ârisks involved in denuding India of
troops.â[68] Revolutionary violence had already been a concern in British
India, and outlines of collaboration with Germany were being identified by
British intelligence; consequently in 1915, to strengthen its powers during
what it saw was a time of increased vulnerability, the Government of India
passed the Defence of India Act, which allowed it to intern politically
dangerous dissidents without due process and added to the power it already had
â under the 1910 Press Act â both to imprison journalists without trial
and to censor the press.[71] Now, as constitutional reform began to be
discussed in earnest, the British began to consider how new moderate Indians
could be brought into the fold of constitutional politics and simultaneously,
how the hand of established constitutionalists could be strengthened.[71]
However, since the Government of India wanted to check the revolutionary
problem, and since its reform plan was devised during a time when extremist
violence had ebbed as a result of increased governmental control, it also
began to consider how some of its war-time powers could be extended into peace
time.[71]

Edwin Montagu, left, the Secretary of State for India, whose report led to the
Government of India Act of 1919, also known as the Montford Reforms or the
Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms.

Consequently in 1917, even as Edwin Montagu announced the new constitutional
reforms, a sedition committee chaired by a British judge, Mr. S. A. T.
Rowlatt, was tasked with investigating revolutionary conspiracies and the
German and Bolshevik links to the violence in India,[72][73][74] with the
unstated goal of extending the government's war-time powers.[70] The Rowlatt
committee presented its report in July 1918 and identified three regions of
conspiratorial insurgency: Bengal, the Bombay presidency, and the Punjab.[70]
To combat subversive acts in these regions, the committee recommended that the
government use emergency powers akin to its war-time authority, which included
the ability to try cases of sedition by a panel of three judges and without
juries, exaction of securities from suspects, governmental overseeing of
residences of suspects,[70] and the power for provincial governments to arrest
and detain suspects in short-term detention facilities and without trial.[75]

With the end of World War I, there was also a change in the economic climate.
By yearâs end 1919, 1.5 million Indians had served in the armed services in
either combatant or non-combatant roles, and India had provided Â£146 million
in revenue for the war.[76] The increased taxes coupled with disruptions in
both domestic and international trade had the effect of approximately doubling
the index of overall prices in India between 1914 and 1920.[76] Returning war
veterans, especially in the Punjab, created a growing unemployment crisis[77]
and post-war inflation led to food riots in Bombay, Madras, and Bengal
provinces,[77] a situation that was made only worse by the failure of the
1918-19 monsoon and by profiteering and speculation.[76] The global influenza
epidemic and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 added to the general jitters;
the former among the population already experiencing economic woes,[77] and
the latter among government officials, fearing a similar revolution in
India.[78]

To combat what it saw as a coming crisis, the government now drafted the
Rowlatt committee's recommendations into two Rowlatt Bills.[75] Although the
bills were authorised for legislative consideration by Edwin Montagu, they
were done so unwillingly, with the accompanying declaration, âI loathe the
suggestion at first sight of preserving the Defence of India Act in peace time
to such an extent as Rowlatt and his friends think necessary.â[70] In the
ensuing discussion and vote in the Imperial Legislative Council, all Indian
members voiced opposition to the bills. The Government of India was
nevertheless able to use of its "official majority" to ensure passage of the
bills early in 1919.[70] However, what it passed, in deference to the Indian
opposition, was a lesser version of the first bill, which now allowed
extrajudicial powers, but for a period of exactly three years and for the
prosecution solely of âanarchical and revolutionary movements,â dropping
entirely the second bill involving modification of the Indian Penal Code.[70]
Even so, when it was passed the new Rowlatt Act aroused widespread indignation
throughout India and brought Mohandas Gandhi to the forefront of the
nationalist movement.[75]

Meanwhile, Montagu and Chelmsford themselves finally presented their report in
July 1918 after a long fact-finding trip through India the previous
winter.[79] After more discussion by the government and parliament in Britain,
and another tour by the Franchise and Functions Committee for the purpose of
identifying who among the Indian population could vote in future elections,
the Government of India Act of 1919 (also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford
Reforms) was passed in December 1919.[79] The new Act enlarged both the
provincial and Imperial legislative councils and repealed the Government of
Indiaâs recourse to the âofficial majorityâ in unfavorable votes.[79]
Although departments like defense, foreign affairs, criminal law,
communications and income-tax were retained by the Viceroy and the central
government in New Delhi, other departments like public health, education,
land-revenue and local self-government were transferred to the provinces.[79]
The provinces themselves were now to be administered under a new dyarchical
system, whereby some areas like education, agriculture, infrastructure
development, and local self-government became the preserve of Indian ministers
and legislatures, and ultimately the Indian electorates, while others like
irrigation, land-revenue, police, prisons, and control of media remained
within the purview of the British governor and his executive council.[79] The
new Act also made it easier for Indians to be admitted into the civil service
and the army officer corps.

A greater number of Indians were now enfranchised, although, for voting at the
national level, they constituted only 10% of the total adult male population,
many of whom were still illiterate.[79] In the provincial legislatures, the
British continued to exercise some control by setting aside seats for special
interests they considered cooperative or useful. In particular, rural
candidates, generally sympathetic to British rule and less confrontational,
were assigned more seats than their urban counterparts.[79] Seats were also
reserved for non-Brahmins, landowners, businessmen, and college graduates. The
principal of âcommunal representation,â an integral part of the Minto-
Morley reforms, and more recently of the Congress-Muslim League Lucknow Pact,
was reaffirmed, with seats being reserved for Muslims, Sikhs, Indian
Christians, Anglo-Indians, and domiciled Europeans, in both provincial and
Imperial legislative councils.[79] The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms offered
Indians the most significant opportunity yet for exercising legislative power,
especially at the provincial level; however, that opportunity was also
restricted by the still limited number of eligible voters, by the small
budgets available to provincial legislatures, and by the presence of rural and
special interest seats that were seen as instruments of British control.[79]
It scope was however, servely dissatisfactory to the Indian political
leadership, famously expressed by Annie Beasant as something "unworthy of
England to offer and India to accept"[80]

In 1935, after the Round Table Conferences, the British Parliament approved
the Government of India Act of 1935, which authorised the establishment of
independent legislative assemblies in all provinces of British India, the
creation of a central government incorporating both the British provinces and
the princely states, and the protection of Muslim minorities.[61] At this
time, it was also decided to separate Burma from British India in 1937, to
form a separate crown colony. The future Constitution of independent India
would owe a great deal to the text of this act.[81] The act also provided for
a bicameral national parliament and an executive branch under the purview of
the British government. Although the national federation was never realised,
nationwide elections for provincial assemblies were held in 1937. Despite
initial hesitation, the Congress took part in the elections and won victories
in seven of the eleven provinces of British India,[82] and Congress
governments, with wide powers, were formed in these provinces. In Great
Britain, these victories were to later turn the tide for the idea of Indian
independence.[82]

### [edit] World War II

Main article: India in World War II

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow,
declared war on Indiaâs behalf without consulting Indian leaders, leading
the Congress provincial ministries to resign in protest. The Muslim League, in
contrast, supported Britain in the war effort; however, it now took the view
that Muslims would be unfairly treated in an independent India dominated by
the Congress. The British governmentâthrough its Cripps' missionâattempted
to secure Indian nationalists' cooperation in the war effort in exchange for
independence afterwards; however, the negotiations between them and the
Congress broke down. Gandhi, subsequently, launched the âQuit Indiaâ
movement in August 1942, demanding the immediate withdrawal of the British
from India or face nationwide civil disobedience. Along with all other
Congress leaders, Gandhi was immediately imprisoned, and the country erupted
in violent demonstrations led by students and later by peasant political
groups, especially in Eastern United Provinces, Bihar, and western Bengal. The
large war-time British Army presence in India led to most of the movement
being crushed in a little more than six weeks;[83] nonetheless, a portion of
the movement formed for a time an underground provisional government on the
border with Nepal.[83] In other parts of India, the movement was less
spontaneous and the protest less intensive, however it lasted sporadically
into the summer of 1943.[84]

With Congress leaders in jail, attention also turned to Subhas Bose, who had
been ousted from the Congress in 1939 following differences with the more
conservative high command;[85] Bose now turned to the Axis powers for help
with liberating India by force.[86] With Japanese support, he organised the
Indian National Army, composed largely of Indian soldiers of the British
Indian army who had been captured at Singapore by the Japanese. From the onset
of the war, the Japanese secret service had promoted unrest in South east Asia
to destabilise the British War effort,[87] and came to support a number of
puppet and provisional governments in the captured regions, including those in
Burma, the Philippines and Vietnam, the Provisional Government of Azad Hind
(Free India), presided by Bose.[88] Bose's effort, however, was short lived;
after the reverses of 1944, the reinforced British Indian Army in 1945 first
halted and then reversed the Japanese U Go offensive, beginning the successful
part of the Burma Campaign. Bose's Indian National Army surrendered with the
recapture of Singapore, and Bose died in a plane crash soon thereafter. The
trials of the INA soldiers at Red Fort in late 1945 however caused widespread
public unrest and nationalist violence in India.[89]

Map of India and Pakistan as envisaged in the Partition Plan

In January 1946, a number of mutinies broke out in the armed services,
starting with that of RAF servicemen frustrated with their slow repatriation
to Britain.[90] The mutinies came to a head with mutiny of the Royal Indian
Navy in Bombay in February 1946, followed by others in Calcutta, Madras, and
Karachi. These mutinies found much public support in India then gripped by the
Red Fort Trials, and had the effect of spurring the new Labour government in
Britain to action, and leading to the Cabinet Mission to India led by the
Secretary of State for India, Lord Pethick Lawrence, and including Sir
Stafford Cripps, who had visited four years before.[90]

Also in early 1946, new elections were called in India in which the Congress
won electoral victories in eight of the eleven provinces.[91] The negotiations
between the Congress and the Muslim League, however, stumbled over the issue
of the partition. Jinnah proclaimed August 16, 1946, Direct Action Day, with
the stated goal of highlighting, peacefully, the demand for a Muslim homeland
in British India. The following day Hindu-Muslim riots broke out in Calcutta
and quickly spread throughout India. Although the Government of India and the
Congress were both shaken by the course of events, in September, a Congress-
led interim government was installed, with Jawaharlal Nehru as united
Indiaâs prime minister.

Later that year, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by
the recently concluded World War II, and conscious that it had neither the
mandate at home, the international support, nor the reliability of native
forces for continuing to control an increasingly restless India,[92][93]
decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947 Britain announced its
intention of transferring power no later than June 1948.

As independence approached, the violence between Hindus and Muslims in the
provinces of Punjab and Bengal continued unabated. With the British army
unprepared for the potential for increased violence, the new viceroy, Louis
Mountbatten, advanced the date for the transfer of power, allowing less than
six months for a mutually agreed plan for independence. In June 1947, the
nationalist leaders, including Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad on behalf of the
Congress, Jinnah representing the Muslim League, B. R. Ambedkar representing
the Untouchable community, and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs,
agreed to a partition of the country along religious lines. The predominantly
Hindu and Sikh areas were assigned to the new India and predominantly Muslim
areas to the new nation of Pakistan; the plan included a partition of the
Muslim-majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal.

Many millions of Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu refugees trekked across the newly
drawn borders. In Punjab, where the new border lines divided the Sikh regions
in half, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Gandhi's
presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was more limited. In all,
anywhere between 250,000 and 500,000 people on both sides of the new borders
died in the violence.[94] On August 14, 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan
came into being, with Muhammad Ali Jinnah sworn in as its first Governor
General in Karachi. The following day, August 15, 1947, India, now a smaller
Union of India, became an independent country with official ceremonies taking
place in New Delhi, and with Jawaharlal Nehru assuming the office of the prime
minister, and the viceroy, Louis Mountbatten, staying on as its first Governor
General.

From the beginning of the seventeenth century to the middle of the eighteenth century the East India Company is a trading corporation, existing on the sufferance of the native powers and in rivalry with the merchant companies of Holland and France. During the next century the Company acquires and consolidates its dominion, shares its sovereignty in increasing proportions with the Crown, and gradually loses its mercantile privileges and functions. After the mutiny of 1857 the remaining powers of the Company are transferred to the Crown, and then follows an era of peace in which India awakens to new life and progress." 2.

Quote:...it was clear to Atlee that everything depended on the spirit and reliability of the Indian Army:"Provided that they do their duty, armed insurrection in India would not be an insolube problem. If, however, the Indian Army was to go the other way, the picture would be very different... Quote:...Thus, Wavell concluded, if the army and the police "failed" Britain would be forced to go. In theory, it might be possible to revive and reinvigorate the services, and rule for another fifteent to trwenty years, but:It is a fallacy to suppose that the solution lies in trying to maintain status quo. We have no longer the resources, nor the necessary prestige or confidence in ourselves.
  93. ^ Brown 1994, p. 330 Quote: "India had always been a minority interest in British public life; no great body of public opinion now emerged to argue that war-weary and impoverished Britain should send troops and money to hold it against its will in an empire of doubtful value. By late 1946 both Prime Minister and Secretary of State for India recognized that neither international opinion no their own voters would stand for any reassertion of the raj, even if there had been the men, money, and administrative machinery with which to do so." Sarkar 1983, p. 418 Quote: "With a war weary army and people and a ravaged economy, Britain would have had to retreat; the Labour victory only quickened the process somewhat." Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p. 212 Quote: "More importantly, though victorious in war, Britain had suffered immensely in the struggle. It simply did not possess the manpower or economic resources required to coerce a restive India."
