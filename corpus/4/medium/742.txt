The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards
organization for the World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or W3). It is arranged as
a consortium where member organizations maintain full-time staff for the
purpose of working together in the development of standards for the World Wide
Web. As of February 2008, the W3C had 434 members.[1]

W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an
open forum for discussion about the Web. It was founded and is headed by Sir
Tim Berners-Lee.[2]

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he
left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October, 1994.
It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for
Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) -- which had pioneered the Internet \-- and the
European Commission.

W3C was created to ensure compatibility and agreement among industry members
in the adoption of new standards. Prior to its creation, incompatible versions
of HTML were offered by different vendors, increasing the potential for
inconsistency between web pages. The consortium was created to get all those
vendors to agree on a set of core principles and components which would be
supported by everyone.

It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however,
CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April
1995 the Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique
(INRIA) became the European host of W3C, with Keio University becoming the
Japanese branch in September 1996. Starting in 1997, W3C created regional
offices around the world; as of October 2007 it has sixteen World Offices
covering Australia, the Benelux countries (the Netherlands, Luxemburg, and
Belgium), China, Finland, Germany and Austria, Greece, Hungary, India,
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Korea, Morocco, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

In January 2003, the European host was transferred from INRIA to the European
Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), an organization
that represents European national computer science laboratories.

## [edit] Recommendations and certifications

Cascading Style Sheets  
CSS Animations  
Comparison of layout engines (CSS)  
Comparison of stylesheet languages  
CSS framework  
CSS Zen Garden  
CSSTidy

Tableless web design

In accord with the W3C Process Document, a Recommendation progresses through
five maturity levels:

  1. Working Draft (WD)
  2. Last Call Working Draft
  3. Candidate Recommendation (CR)
  4. Proposed Recommendation (PR)
  5. W3C Recommendation (REC)

A Recommendation may be updated by separately published Errata until enough
substantial edits accumulate, at which time a new edition of the
Recommendation may be produced (e.g., XML is now in its fourth edition). W3C
also publishes various kinds of informative Notes which are not intended to be
treated as standards.

W3C leaves it up to manufacturers to follow the Recommendations. Many of its
standards define levels of conformance, which the developers must follow if
they wish to label their product W3C-compliant. Like any standards of other
organizations, W3C recommendations are sometimes implemented partially. The
Recommendations are under a royalty-free patent license, allowing anyone to
implement them.

Unlike the ISOC and other international standards bodies, the W3C does not
have a certification program. A certification program is a process which has
benefits and drawbacks; the W3C has decided, for now, that it is not suitable
to start such a program owing to the risk of creating more drawbacks for the
community than benefits.

The Consortium is jointly administered by the MIT Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in the USA, the European Research
Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) (in Sophia Antipolis,
France), and Keio University (in Japan). The W3C also has World Offices in
sixteen regions around the world. The W3C Offices work with their regional Web
communities to promote W3C technologies in local languages, broaden W3C's
geographical base, and encourage international participation in W3C
Activities.

## [edit] Membership

The domain w3.org attracted at least 11 million visitors annually by 2008
according to a Compete.com study.[3]

The Consortium is governed by its membership, which in September 2008
comprised 419 organizations. The list of members is available to the
public.[4] Members include only businesses, nonprofit organizations,
universities, and governmental entities. There is no provision for individual
membership.[5]

Membership requirements are transparent except for one requirement. An
application for membership must be reviewed and approved by W3C. Many
guidelines and requirements are stated in detail, but there is no final
guideline about the process or standards by which membership might be finally
approved or denied.[6]

The cost of membership is given on a sliding scale, depending on the character
of the organization applying and the country in which it is located.[7]
Countries are categorized by the World Bank's most recent grouping by GNI
("Gross National Income") per capita.[8]

### [edit] Fees Schedule for 2007

European, Middle Eastern, and African organizations pay dues denominated in
Euros, as follows:

  * The fee charged to for-profit companies with annual gross revenues exceeding â¬51 million was â¬65,000, regardless of location.
  * The fee charged to for-profit companies with annual gross revenues under â¬51 million but greater than the "Other organization" cap (see below) was â¬6,500, regardless of location.
  * Smaller and non-profit organizations located in lower GNI countries enjoy two price advantages: 
    * In High Income Countries (HIC) such as France and Israel, non-profit organizations and for-profit organizations with AGR under â¬51 million are charged â¬6,500.
    * In Upper Middle Income Countries (UMC) such as Poland and South Africa, nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies with AGR under â¬30.6 million pay â¬3,900.
    * In Lower Middle Income Countries (LMC) such as Ukraine and Jordan, nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies with AGR under â¬15.3 million pay â¬1,950.
    * In Lower Income Countries (LIC) such as Pakistan and Kenya, nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies with AGR under â¬7.65 million pay â¬975.

Similar scales apply to dues denominated in yen for some Asian countries, and
US dollars for all others.

## [edit] Criticism

### [edit] Domination by large organizations

The W3C has been criticized as being dominated by larger organizations and
thus writing standards that represent their interests. For example, a member
of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG)[9]
complained that:

> The process is stacked in favour of multinationals with expense accounts who
can afford to talk on the phone for two hours a week and jet to world capitals
for meetings.[10]

A similar criticism, responding to large software company complaints about the
slow pace of W3C's formulation of XML/web services standards, appeared in
Cnet's news.com in 2002:

> "I'm not convinced that developers are too bothered," said Edd Dumbill,
editor of XML.com, who has worked as a software developer on Web services. "I
think developers are being poorly served by the fact that the big companies
have dominated the work of the W3C over the last year. The W3C does more or
less what its members tell it to. So I don't have a huge amount of sympathy
for the complaints of large companies."[11]
