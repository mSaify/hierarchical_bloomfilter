Kunth  
Guarana from the Portuguese: guaranÃ¡ (IPA: [É¡uÌ¯a.ra.'na], [É¡uÌ¯a.É¾a.'na]
or [É¡uÌ¯a.'É¹a.na]), Paullinia cupana (syn. P. crysan, P. sorbilis), is a
climbing plant in the maple family, Sapindaceae, native to the Amazon basin
and especially common in Brazil. Guarana features large leaves and clusters of
flowers, and is best known for its fruit, which is about the size of a coffee
berry. As a dietary supplement, guarana is an effective energy booster â it
contains about twice the caffeine found in coffee beans (about 2-4.5% caffeine
in guarana seeds compared to 1-2% for coffee beans).[1]

As with other plants producing caffeine, the high concentration of caffeine is
a defensive toxin that repels pathogens from the berry and its seeds.[2]

The guarana fruit's color ranges from brown to red and contains black seeds
which are partly covered by white arils. The color contrast when the fruit has
been split open has been likened to eyeballs; this has formed the basis of a
myth.[3]

## [edit] History and culture

The word guarana comes from the Portuguese guaranÃ¡, which has its origins in
the SaterÃ©-MauÃ© word warana.[4]

Guarana plays an important role in Tupi and GuaranÃ­ Brazilian culture.
According to a myth dating back to the SaterÃ©-MauÃ© tribe, guarana's
domestication originated with a deity killing a beloved village child. In
order to console the villagers, a more benevolent god plucked the left eye
from the child and planted it in the forest, resulting in the wild variety of
guarana. The god then plucked the right eye from the child and planted it in
the village, giving rise to domesticated guarana.[5]

The GuaranÃ­s would make tea by shelling and washing the seeds, followed by
pounding them into a fine powder. The powder is kneaded into a dough and then
shaped into cylinders. This product is known as guarana bread or Brazilia
coke, which would be grated and then immersed into hot water along with
sugar.[6]

This plant was introduced to western civilization in the 17th century
following its discovery by Father Felip Betendorf. By 1958, guarana was
commercialized.[6]

## [edit] Composition

Below are some of the chemicals found in guarana.[7][8]

Chemical Plant part Parts per million  
Adenine seed  
Ash seed < 14,200  
Caffeine seed 9,100 - 76,000  
Catechutannic-acid seed  
Choline seed  
D-catechin seed  
Fat seed < 30,000  
Guanine seed  
Hypoxanthine seed  
Mucilage seed  
Protein seed < 98,600  
Resin seed < 70,000  
Saponin seed  
Starch seed 50,000 - 60,000  
Tannin seed 50,000 - 120,000  
Theobromine seed 200 - 400  
Theophylline seed 0 - 2500  
Timbonine seed  
Xanthine seed  
According to the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank, when guaranine is
defined as only the caffeine chemical in guarana, it is identical to the
caffeine chemical derived from other sources, for example coffee, tea, and
mate. Guaranine, theine, and mateine are all synonyms for caffeine when the
definitions of those words include none of the properties and chemicals of
their host plants except the chemical caffeine.[9] Natural sources of caffeine
contain widely varying mixtures of xanthine alkaloids other than caffeine,
including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine and other
substances such as polyphenols which can form insoluble complexes with
caffeine.[10]

## [edit] Uses

Guarana soft drinks, such as GuaranÃ¡ Antarctica, are very popular in Brazil.

Guarana is used in sweetened or carbonated soft drinks and energy shots, an
ingredient of herbal tea or contained in capsules. Generally, South America
obtains most of its caffeine from guarana.[11]

### [edit] Beverages

See also: List of beverages containing guarana

Brazil, which is the third-largest consumer of soft drinks in the world,[12]
produces several soft drink brands from guarana extract. Exceeding Brazilian
sales of cola drinks,[13] guarana-containing beverages may cause jitters
associated with drinking coffee.

### [edit] Cognitive effects

As guarana is rich in caffeine, it is of interest for its potential effects on
cognition. In rats, guarana increased memory retention and physical endurance
when compared with a placebo.[14]

A 2007 human pilot study[15] assessed acute behavioral effects to four doses
(37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg) of guarana extract. Memory, alertness and
mood were increased by the two lower doses, confirming previous results of
cognitive improvement following 75 mg guarana. These studies have not been
evaluated by any US government agencies, so within the US there is no medical
or regulatory approval for use of guarana to enhance cognition.

### [edit] Other uses and side-effects

Guarana seed powder

In the United States, guarana has the status of being generally recognized as
safe (GRAS).[16]

Preliminary research has shown guarana may affect how quickly the body
perceives itself to be full. One study showed an average 11.2 pound (5.1
kilogram) weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guarana, and
damiana, compared to an average one pound loss in a placebo group after 45
days.[17] Although inconclusive about specific effects due only to guarana,
this study differs from another showing no effect on body weight of a formula
containing guarana.[18]

Guarana extract reduced aggregation of rabbit platelets by up to 37 percent
below control values and decreased platelet thromboxane formation from
arachidonic acid by 78 percent below control values.[19] It is not known if
such platelet action has any effect on the risk of heart attack or ischemic
stroke.[20]

Other laboratory studies showed antioxidant and antibacterial effects, and
also fat cell reduction in mice (when combined with conjugated linoleic acid)
from chronic intake of guarana.[21]

From anecdotal evidence of excessive consumption of energy drinks, guarana may
contribute (alone or in combination with caffeine and taurine) to onset of
seizures in some people.[22]
