Chile, officially the Republic of Chile (Spanish: RepChile.ogg RepÃºblica de
Chile), is a country in South America occupying a long and narrow coastal
strip wedged between the Andes mountains and the Pacific Ocean. It borders
Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the
Drake Passage at the country's southernmost tip. It is one of only two
countries in South America that does not have a border with Brazil. The
Pacific forms the country's entire western border, with a coastline that
stretches over 6,435 kilometres.[5] Chilean territory extends to the Pacific
Ocean which includes the overseas territories of Juan FernÃ¡ndez Islands, the
Salas y GÃ³mez islands, the Desventuradas Islands and Easter Island located in
Polynesia. Chile claims 1,250,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi) of
territory in Antarctica.

Chile's unusual, ribbon-like shape â 4,300 kilometres (2,700 mi) long and on
average 175 kilometres (109 mi) wide â has given it a varied climate,
ranging from the world's driest desert â the Atacama â in the north,
through a Mediterranean climate in the centre, to a snow-prone Alpine climate
in the south, with glaciers, fjords and lakes.[6] The northern Chilean desert
contains great mineral wealth, principally copper. The relatively small
central area dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural
resources. This area also is the cultural and political center from which
Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it incorporated its northern and
southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands and
features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of
fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains
are located on the eastern border.[7]

Prior to the coming of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was
under Inca rule while the indigenous Araucanians inhabited central and
southern Chile. Although Chile declared its independence in 1810, decisive
victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the
Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present
northern regions. It was not until the 1880s that the Araucanian Indians were
completely subjugated.[5] The country, which had been relatively free of the
coups and arbitrary governments that blighted the South American continent,
endured a 17 year military dictatorship (1973-1990), one of the bloodiest in
20th-century Latin America that left more than 3,000 people dead and
missing.[6]

Currently, Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous
nations.[6] Within the greater Latin American context it leads in terms of
human development, gross domestic product per capita (at market prices[8] and
purchasing power parity[9]), competitiveness, quality of life, political
stability, globalization, economic freedom, low perception of corruption and
comparatively low poverty rates.[10] It also ranks high regionally in freedom
of the press and democratic development. It has a high income inequality, as
measured by the Gini index.[4]

## Etymology

There are various theories about the origin of the word Chile. According to a
theory proposed by 18th century Spanish chronicler Diego de Rosales,[11] the
Incas of Peru called the valley of the Aconcagua "Chili" by corruption of the
name of a Picunche tribal chief ("cacique") called Tili, who ruled the area at
the time of the Incan conquest in the 15th century.[12][13] Another theory
points to the similarity of the valley of the Aconcagua with that of the Casma
Valley in Peru, where there was a town and valley named Chili.[13] Other
theories say Chile may derive its name from the indigenous Mapuche word
chilli, which may mean "where the land ends,"[14] "the deepest point of the
Earth,"[15] or "sea gulls;"[16] or from the Quechua chin, "cold", or the
Aymara tchili, meaning "snow".[17][18] Another meaning attributed to chilli is
the onomatopoeic cheele-cheeleâthe Mapuche imitation of a bird call.[14] The
Spanish conquistadors heard about this name from the Incas, and the few
survivors of Diego de Almagro's first Spanish expedition south from Peru in
1535-36 called themselves the "men of Chilli."[14] Ultimately, Almagro is
credited with the universalization of the name Chile, after naming the Mapocho
valley as such.[13]

## History

Main article: History of Chile

<IMG>

<IMG>

The Mapuche were the original inhabitants of central and southern Chile.

About 10,000 years ago, migrating Native Americans settled in fertile valleys
and coastal areas of what is present day Chile. Example settlement sites from
the very early human habitation are Cueva del Milodon and the Pali Aike
Crater's lava tube.[19] The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is
now northern Chile, but the Mapuche successfully resisted many attempts by the
Inca Empire to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.[20]
They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of
the bloody three-day confrontation known as the Battle of the Maule was that
the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the Maule river.[21]

In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, Ferdinand Magellan
discovered the southern passage now named after him, the Strait of Magellan.
The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of
Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish
encountered hundreds of thousands of Native Americans from various cultures in
the area that modern Chile now occupies. These cultures supported themselves
principally through slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting. The conquest of
Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by Pedro de Valdivia, one
of Francisco Pizarro's lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on
February 12, 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and
silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's
central valley, and Chile became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru.

Pedro de Valdivia.

Conquest of the land took place only gradually, and the Europeans suffered
repeated setbacks at the hands of the local population. A massive Mapuche
insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the
destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major
insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other
native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven
northward. The abolition of slavery in 1683 defused tensions on the frontier
between the colony and the Mapuche land to the south, which permitted
increased trade between colonists and the Mapuche.

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche (or Araucanians),
to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became
one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving
as a sort of frontier garrison, the colony found itself with the mission of
forestalling encroachment by Araucanians and by Spain's European enemies,
especially the British and the Dutch. In addition to the Araucanians,
buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony, as was shown by Sir
Francis Drake's 1578 raid on ValparaÃ­so, the principal port. Because Chile
hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, it was one of the
most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a drain on the
treasury of Peru.[14]

The drive for independence from Spain was precipitated by usurpation of the
Spanish throne by Napoleon's brother Joseph in 1808. A national junta in the
name of Ferdinandâheir to the deposed kingâwas formed on September 18,
1810. The junta proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish
monarchy. A movement for total independence soon won a wide following. Spanish
attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the "Reconquista"
led to a prolonged struggle.

Bernardo O'Higgins.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817, when an army led by Bernardo
O'Higgins, Chile's most renowned patriot, and JosÃ© de San MartÃ­n, hero of
the Argentine War of Independence, crossed the Andes into Chile and defeated
the royalists. On February 12, 1818, Chile was proclaimed an independent
republic under O'Higgins' leadership. The political revolt brought little
social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence
of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by
family politics and the Roman Catholic Church. A strong presidency eventually
emerged, but wealthy landowners remained extremely powerful.

War of the Pacific: The Battle of Iquique on May 21, 1879.

Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the government in Santiago
consolidated its position in the south by ruthlessly suppressing the Mapuche
during the Occupation of AraucanÃ­a. In 1881, it signed a treaty with
Argentina confirming Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. As a
result of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia (1879â83), Chile
expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's
access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable nitrate deposits, the
exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. The Chilean Civil
War in 1891 brought about a redistribution of power between the President and
Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the
Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of
local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the
House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Hence the Chilean
economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a
ruling oligarchy. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were
powerful enough to elect a reformist president, Arturo Alessandri Palma, whose
program was frustrated by a conservative congress. Alessandri Palma's
reformist tendencies were partly tempered later by an admiration for some
elements of Benito Mussolini's Italian Corporate State. In the 1920s, Marxist
groups with strong popular support arose.

Diego Portales (1793-1837), Founder of the Chilean State and creator of the
Constitution of 1833.

A military coup led by General Luis Altamirano in 1924 set off a period of
great political instability that lasted until 1932. The longest lasting of the
ten governments between those years was that of General Carlos IbÃ¡Ã±ez del
Campo, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in
what was a de facto dictatorship, although not really comparable in harshness
or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled
the rest of Latin America, and certainly not comparable to the violent and
repressive regime of Augusto Pinochet decades later. By relinquishing power to
a democratically elected successor, IbÃ¡Ã±ez del Campo retained the respect of
a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for
more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his
ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class
party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments
for the next 20 years. During the period of Radical Party dominance
(1932â52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters
returned IbÃ¡Ã±ez del Campo to office for another six years. Jorge Alessandri
succeeded IbÃ¡Ã±ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into
power democratically for another term.

The 1964 presidential election of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva by
an absolute majority initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan
"Revolution in Liberty", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching
social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and agrarian
reform, including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967,
however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged
that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them
excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had accomplished many noteworthy
objectives, but he had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.

In 1970, Senator Salvador Allende Gossens won a plurality of votes in a three-
way contest. He was a Marxist physician and member of Chile's Socialist Party,
who headed the "Popular Unity" (UP or "Unidad Popular") coalition of the
Socialist, Communist, Radical, and Social-Democratic Parties, along with
dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement (MAPU), and
the Independent Popular Action. Despite pressure from the government of the
United States, the Chilean Congress, keeping with tradition, conducted a
runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge
Alessandri and chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an
alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian
Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the
oligarchs.

Allende's program included advancement of workers' interests; implementation
of agrarian reform; reorganization of the national economy into socialized,
mixed, and private sectors; a foreign policy of "international solidarity" and
national independence; and a new institutional order (the "people's state" or
"poder popular"), including the institution of a unicameral congress. The
Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of foreign (U.S.)
ownership of Chile's major copper mines.

An economic depression that began in 1967 peaked in 1970, exacerbated by
capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits
by those opposed to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and
unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage
increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer
spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private public works
projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was
nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, nitrate, and
steel industries were expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state
intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during
the Allende administration's first year.

Other reforms undertaken during the early Allende period included
redistributing millions of hectares of land to landless agricultural workers
as part of the agrarian reform program, giving the armed forces an overdue pay
increase, and providing free milk to children. The Indian Peoples Development
Corporation and the Mapuche Vocational Institute were founded to address the
needs of Chile's indigenous population.

The nationalization of U.S. and other foreign-owned companies led to increased
tensions with the United States. As a result, the Richard Nixon administration
organized and inserted secret operatives in Chile, in order to quickly
destabilize Allendeâs government.[22][23][24][25] In addition, international
financial pressure restricted economic credit to Chile.  
Simultaneously, the CIA funded opposition media, politicians, and
organizations, helping to accelerate a campaign of domestic destabilization.
By 1972, the economic progress of Allende's first year had been reversed, and
the economy was in crisis. Political polarization increased, and large
mobilizations of both pro- and anti-government groups became frequent, often
leading to clashes.

The Controversial General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte

By early 1973, inflation was out of control. The crippled economy was further
battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous strikes by physicians,
teachers, students, truck owners, copper workers, and the small business
class. A military coup overthrew Allende on September 11, 1973. As the armed
forces bombarded the presidential palace (Palacio de La Moneda), Allende
reportedly committed suicide.[26][27] A military government, led by General
Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, took over control of the country. The first years of
the regime were marked by serious human rights violations. On October 1973, at
least 72 people were murdered by the Caravan of Death.[28] At least a thousand
people were executed during the first six months of Pinochet in office, and at
least two thousand more were killed during the next sixteen years, as reported
by the Rettig Report. Some 30,000 were forced to flee the country, and tens of
thousands of people were detained and tortured, as investigated by the 2004
Valech Commission. A new Constitution was approved by a highly irregular and
undemocratic plebiscite characterized by the absence of registration lists, on
September 11, 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for
an 8-year term.

In the late 1980s, the regime gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly,
speech, and association, to include trade union and limited political
activity. The right-wing military government pursued free market economic
policies. During Pinochet's nearly 17 years in power, Chile moved away from
state involvement, toward a largely free market economy that saw an increase
in domestic and foreign private investment, although the copper industry and
other important mineral resources were not returned to foreign ownership. In a
plebiscite on October 5, 1988, General Pinochet was denied a second 8-year
term as president (56% against 44%). Chileans elected a new president and the
majority of members of a two-chamber congress on December 14, 1989. Christian
Democrat Patricio Aylwin, the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties
called the ConcertaciÃ³n, received an absolute majority of votes (55%).[29]
President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition
period.

In December 1993, Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the son of
previous president Eduardo Frei Montalva, led the ConcertaciÃ³n coalition to
victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%).[30] Frei Ruiz-Tagle was
succeeded in 2000 by Socialist Ricardo Lagos, who won the presidency in an
unprecedented runoff election against JoaquÃ­n LavÃ­n of the rightist Alliance
for Chile.[31] In January 2006 Chileans elected their first woman president,
Michelle Bachelet Jeria, of the Socialist Party.[32] She was sworn in on March
11, 2006, extending the ConcertaciÃ³n coalition governance for another four
years.[33]

A long and narrow coastal Southern Cone country on the west side of the Andes
Mountains, Chile stretches over 4,630 kilometres (2,880 mi) north to south,
but only 430 kilometres (265 mi) at its widest point east to west. This
encompasses a remarkable variety of landscapes. It contains 756,950 square
kilometres (292,260 sq mi) of land area.

The northern Atacama Desert contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper
and nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago,
dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This
area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late
nineteenth century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions.
Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of
volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets,
canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on
the eastern border. Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, and
also claims 1,250,000 km2 (480,000 sq mi) of Antarctica as part of its
territory. However, this latter claim is suspended under the terms of the
Antarctic Treaty, of which Chile is signatory.[34]

Chile controls Easter Island and Sala y GÃ³mez Island, the easternmost islands
of Polynesia, which it incorporated to its territory in 1888, and Robinson
Crusoe Island, more than 600 kilometres (370 mi) from the mainland, in the
Juan FernÃ¡ndez archipelago. Easter Island is nowadays a province of Chile.
Also controlled but only temporally inhabited (by some local fishermen) are
the small islands of Sala y GÃ³mez, San Ambrosio and San Felix. These islands
are notable because they extend Chile's claim to territorial waters out from
its coast into the Pacific. [35] <\--above reference covers entire

### Administrative division

Main articles: Regions of Chile, Provinces of Chile, and Communes of Chile

Chile is divided into 15 regions, each of which is headed by an intendant
appointed by the President of Chile. Every region is further divided into
provinces, with a provincial governor also appointed by the president. Finally
each province is divided into communes[36] which are administered by
municipalities, each with its own mayor and councilmen elected by their
inhabitants for four years.

Each region is designated by a name and a Roman numeral, assigned from north
to south. The only exception is the region housing the nation's capital, which
is designated RM, that stands for RegiÃ³n Metropolitana (Metropolitan Region).

Two new regions, Arica and Parinacota in the north, and Los RÃ­os in the
south, were created in 2006, and became operative in October 2007. In the
numbering scheme, Region XIII was skipped; Arica and Parinacota was designated
Region XV, while Los RÃ­os was designated Region XIV.

### Climate

Main article: Climate of Chile

A Glacier in southern Chile.

The climate of Chile comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a
large geographic scale, extending across 38 degrees in latitude, making
generalisations difficult. According to the KÃ¶ppen system, Chile within its
borders hosts at least seven major climatic subtypes, ranging from desert in
the north, to alpine tundra and glaciers in the east and south east, humid
subtropical in Easter Island, Oceanic in the south and mediterranean climate
in central Chile. There are four seasons in most of the country: summer
(December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and
spring (September to November).

### Time zones

Because of the distance between the mainland and Easter Island, Chile uses 4
different UTC offsets:

  * The mainland uses UTC-4, and in summer as daylight saving time UTC-3.
  * Easter Island uses UTC-6, and in summer as daylight saving time UTC-5.

## Economy

Chilean notes currently in circulation.

After a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile began to experience a
moderate economic downturn in 1999, brought on by unfavorable global economic
conditions related to the Asian financial crisis, which began in 1997. The
economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of
recovery, achieving 4.0% real GDP growth.[37] The Chilean economy finished
2004 with growth of 6.0%. Real GDP growth reached 5.7% in 2005 before falling
back to 4.0% growth in 2006. Higher energy prices as well as lagging consumer
demand were drags on the economy in 2006. Higher Chilean Government spending
and favorable external conditions (including record copper prices for much of
2006) were not enough to offset these drags. For the first time in many years,
Chilean economic growth in 2006 was among the weakest in Latin America. GDP
expanded 5.1% in 2007.[7]

<IMG>

Chilean (blue) and average South American (orange) GDP per Capita (1945-2003).

Chile has pursued generally sound economic policies for nearly three
decades.[38] The 1973-90 military government sold many state-owned companies,
and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued privatization,
though at a slower pace. The government's role in the economy is mostly
limited to regulation, although the state continues to operate copper giant
CODELCO and a few other enterprises (there is one state-run bank). Chile is
strongly committed to free trade and has welcomed large amounts of foreign
investment. Chile has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with a whole network
of countries, including an FTA with the United States, which was signed in
2003 and implemented in January 2004.[39] Over the last several years, Chile
has signed FTAs with the European Union, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore,
Brunei, China, and Japan. It reached a partial trade agreement with India in
2005 and began negotiations for a full-fledged FTA with India in 2006. Chile
conducted trade negotiations in 2007 with Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand,
as well as with China to expand an existing agreement beyond just trade in
goods. Chile concluded FTA negotiations with Australia and the expanded
agreement with China in 2008. The members of the P4 (Chile, Singapore, New
Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to conclude a chapter on finance and investment
in 2008.[7] The economic international organization the OECD agreed to invite
Chile to be among four countries to open discussions in becoming an official
member.[40]

High domestic savings and investment rates helped propel Chile's economy to
average growth rates of 8% during the 1990s. The privatized national pension
system (AFP) has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an
estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21% of GDP.[41]
However, the AFP is not without its critics, who cite low participation rates
(only 55% of the working population is covered), with groups such as the self-
employed outside the system. There has also been criticism of the inefficiency
and high costs because of a lack of competition among pension funds. Critics
cite loopholes in the use of pension savings through lump sum withdraws for
the purchase of a second home or payment of university fees as fundamental
weaknesses of the AFP. The Bachelet administration plans substantial reform,
but not an overhaul, of the AFP during the next several years.[7]

Chile GDP growth since 1961.

Unemployment hovered in the 8%-10% range after the start of the economic
slowdown in 1999, above the 7% average for the 1990s. Unemployment finally
dipped to 7.8% for 2006, and has kept falling in 2007, averaging 6.8% monthly
(up to August).[42] Wages have risen faster than inflation as a result of
higher productivity, boosting national living standards. The percentage of
Chileans with household incomes below the poverty lineâdefined as twice the
cost of satisfying a person's minimal nutritional needsâfell from 45.1% in
1987 to 13.7% in 2006, according to government polls.[43] Critics in Chile,
however, argue true poverty figures are considerably higher than those
officially published, because the government uses an outdated 1987 household
budget poll, updated every 10 years. According to these critics, using the
1997 household budget data, the poverty rate rises to 29%.[44] Using the
relative yardstick favoured in many European countries, 27% of Chileans would
be poor, according to Juan Carlos Feres of the ECLAC.[45] Despite enjoying a
comparatively higher GDP and more robust economy compared to most other
countries of Latin America, Chile also suffers from one of the most uneven
distributions of wealth in the world, ahead only of Brazil in the Latin
American region and lagging behind even of most developing sub-Saharan African
nations. Chile's top 10 richest percentile possesses 47 percent of the
country's wealth.[46] In relation to income distribution, some 6.2% of the
country populates the upper economic income bracket, 15% the middle bracket,
21% the lower middle, 38% the lower bracket, and 20% the extreme poor.

Chile's independent Central Bank pursues an inflation target of between 2% and
4%. Inflation has not exceeded 5% since 1998. Chile registered an inflation
rate of 3.2% in 2006. The Chilean peso's rapid appreciation against the U.S.
dollar in recent years has helped dampen inflation. Most wage settlements and
loans are indexed, reducing inflation's volatility. Under the compulsory
private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10% of their salaries
into privately managed funds.[7]

Total foreign direct investment (FDI) was only $3.4 billion in 2006, up 52%
from a poor performance in 2005. However, 80% of FDI continues to go to only
four sectors: electricity, gas, water and mining. Much of the jump in FDI in
2006 was also the result of acquisitions and mergers and has done little to
create new employment in Chile. The Chilean Government has formed a Council on
Innovation and Competition, which is tasked with identifying new sectors and
industries to promote. It is hoped that this, combined with some tax reforms
to encourage domestic and foreign investment in research and development, will
bring in additional FDI and to new parts of the economy. As of 2006, Chile
invested only 0.6% of its annual GDP in research and development (R&D). Even
then, two-thirds of that was government spending. The fact that domestic and
foreign companies spend almost nothing on R&D does not bode well for the
Government of Chile's efforts to develop innovative, knowledge-based
sectors.[neutrality disputed] Beyond its general economic and political
stability, the government also has encouraged the use of Chile as an
"investment platform" for multinational corporations planning to operate in
the region, but this will have limited value given the developing business
climate in Chile itself. Chile's approach to foreign direct investment is
codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law, which gives foreign
investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is simple and
transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official
foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.[7]

Faced with an international economic downturn the government announced a $4
billion economic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth despite the
global financial crisis, aiming for an expansion of between 2 percent and 3
percent of GDP for 2009. Nonetheless, economic analysts differ from the
government stimates and forecast economic growth at a median of 1.5
percent.[47]

### Foreign trade

Chile is responsible for over a third of world's copper production.

2006 was a record year for Chilean trade. Total trade registered a 31%
increase over 2005. During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US$58
billion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the
skyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical
high of US$33.3 billion. Imports totaled US$35 billion, an increase of 17%
compared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of
US$23 billion in 2006.[7]

The main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US$39 billion),
Asia (US$27.8 billion) and Europe (US$22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile's
export markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to
Europe. Within Chile's diversified network of trade relationships, its most
important partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was
US$14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement went into
effect on January 1, 2004, U.S.-Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal
Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and
the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile
has grown over 60% since then.[7]

Total trade with Europe also grew in 2006, expanding by 42%. The Netherlands
and Italy were Chile's main European trading partners. Total trade with Asia
also grew significantly at nearly 31%. Trade with Korea and Japan grew
significantly, but China remained Chile's most important trading partner in
Asia. Chile's total trade with China reached U.S. $8.8 billion in 2006,
representing nearly 66% of the value of its trade relationship with Asia.[7]

Chile is the world's fifth largest exporter of wine.[48]

The growth of exports in 2006 was mainly caused by a strong increase in sales
to the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. These three markets alone
accounted for an additional US$5.5 billion worth of Chilean exports. Chilean
exports to the United States totaled US$9.3 billion, representing a 37.7%
increase compared to 2005 (US$6.7 billion). Exports to the European Union were
US$15.4 billion, a 63.7% increased compared to 2005 (US$9.4 billion). Exports
to Asia increased from US$15.2 billion in 2005 to US$19.7 billion in 2006, a
29.9% increase.[7]

During 2006, Chile imported US$26 billion from the Americas, representing 54%
of total imports, followed by Asia at 22%, and Europe at 16%. Mercosur members
were the main suppliers of imports to Chile at US$9.1 billion, followed by the
United States with US$5.5 billion and the European Union with US$5.2 billion.
From Asia, China was the most important exporter to Chile, with goods valued
at US$3.6 billion. Year-on-year growth in imports was especially strong from a
number of countriesâEcuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), Korea (52.6%), and
China (36.9%).[7]

Chile's overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper
exports. The state-owned firm CODELCO is the world's largest copper-producing
company, with recorded copper reserves of 200 years. Chile has made an effort
to expand nontraditional exports. The most important non-mineral exports are
forestry and wood products, fresh fruit and processed food, fishmeal and
seafood, and wine.[7]

Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing
agreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed free trade agreements (FTA) with
Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade
agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. An association agreement
with MercosurâArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguayâwent into effect in
October 1996. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile
completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and
South Korea. Chile, as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To
that end, it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand,
Singapore, Brunei, India, China, and most recently Japan. In 2007, Chile held
trade negotiations with Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. In 2008,
Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia, and finalize an expanded
agreement (covering trade in services and investment) with China. The P4
(Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to expand ties through
adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement. Chile's
trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in
2008.[7]

After two years of negotiations, the United States and Chile signed an
agreement in June 2003 that will lead to completely duty-free bilateral trade
within 12 years. The U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force January 1, 2004,
following approval by the U.S. and Chilean congresses. The bilateral FTA has
inaugurated greatly expanded U.S.-Chilean trade ties, with total bilateral
trade jumping by 154% during the FTA's first three years.[7]

Chile unilaterally lowered its across-the-board import tariff for all
countries with which it does not have a trade agreement to 6% in 2003. Higher
effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar
as a result of a system of import price bands. The price bands were ruled
inconsistent with Chile's World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations in 2002,
and the government has introduced legislation to modify them. Under the terms
of the U.S.-Chile FTA, the price bands will be completely phased out for U.S.
imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar within 12 years.[7]

Chile is a strong proponent of pressing ahead on negotiations for a Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA) and is active in the WTO's Doha round of
negotiations, principally through its membership in the G-20 and Cairns
Group.[7]

### Finance

<IMG>

<IMG>

Skyline of Santiago's Financial District.

Chile's financial sector has grown quickly in recent years, with a banking
reform law approved in 1997 that broadened the scope of permissible foreign
activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean Government implemented a further
liberalization of capital markets in 2001, and there is further pending
legislation proposing further liberalization. Over the last ten years,
Chileans have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as home
equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit
cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an
increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards.
Chile's private pension system, with assets worth roughly $70 billion at the
end of 2006, has been an important source of investment capital for the
capital market. However, by 2009, it has been reported that $21 billion had
been lost from the pension system to the global financial crisis. [49] Chile
maintains one of the best credit ratings (S&P A+) in Latin America.[50]There
are three main ways for Chilean firms to raise funds abroad: bank loans,
issuance of bonds, and the selling of stocks on U.S. markets through American
Depository Receipts (ADRs). Nearly all of the funds raised through these means
go to finance domestic Chilean investment. The government is required by law
to run a fiscal surplus of at least 1% of GDP. In 2006, the Government of
Chile ran a surplus of $11.3 billion, equal to almost 8% of GDP. The
Government of Chile continues to pay down its foreign debt, with public debt
only 3.9% of GDP at the end of 2006.[7]

## Demographics

Population of Chile from 1820, projected up to 2050.

Chile's 2002 census reported a population of 15,116,435. Its growth has been
declining since 1990, because of a decreasing birth rate.[51] By 2050 the
population is expected to reach approximately 20.2 million.[52] About 85% of
the country's population lives in urban areas, with 40% living in Greater
Santiago. The largest agglomerations according to the 2002 census are Greater
Santiago with 5.4 million people, Greater ValparaÃ­so with 804,000 and Greater
ConcepciÃ³n with 666,000.

### Racial and ethnic structure

<IMG>

<IMG>

Congregation of people in Chile

The Chilean population is approximately 30% white, with mestizos of
predominantly white (castizos) ancestry further estimated at 65%.[53]  
Another recent study estimates that the white population corresponds to about
8.8 millions or 52,7% of Chileans.[54] The White and Mestizo figures appear
combined in some sources, so that Chile's population is classified as 95.4%
white and white-amerindian by publications such as the World Factbook.[55][56]

The white segment, also consists mainly of Spanish descent, as well as
Italian, Irish, French, German, English, Swiss or Croat ancestry, alone or
combined among themselves. The mestizo segment, and derives from the racial
mixture between colonial Spanish settlers (mainly Andalusians and Castilian)
and indigenous tribes (mainly Picunches, Diaguitas and Mapuches). In that
respect, Chile is relatively homogeneous, with the majority of the people
sharing a common ethnic identity stemming from what is known locally as
Chilenidad.

The Afro-Chilean population was negligible, reaching a high of 25,000 during
the colonial period; their racial contribution is less than 1%. The current
Native American population is small (see below) according to the censuses;
their numbers are boosted when taking into consideration those that are
associated to them either linguistically or socially.[57]

According to the Census 2002, 4.6% of the Chilean population was Indian,
although most show varying degrees of miscegenation.[58]

### Indigenous communities

Those belonging to recognised indigenous communities (2002)  
Alacaluf 2,622 0.02% Mapuche 604,349 4.00%  
AtacameÃ±o 21,015 0.14% Quechua 6,175 0.04%  
Aymara 48,501 0.32% Rapanui 4,647 0.03%  
Colla 3,198 0.02% YÃ¡mana 1,685 0.01%  
The 1907 census reported 101,118 Araucanian Indians, or 3.1% of the total
country population. Only those that practiced their native culture or spoke
their native language were considered, irrespective of their "racial
purity."[59]

At the 1992 census, a total of 10.33% of the total Chilean population surveyed
declared themselves indigenous, irrespective of whether they currently
practiced a native culture or spoke a native language; almost one million
people (9.61% of Chileans) declared themselves Mapuche, 0.50% declared to be
Aymara, and 0.23% reported as Rapanui.

At the 2002 census, only indigenous people that still practiced a native
culture or spoke a native language were surveyed: 4.6% of the population
(692,192 people) fit that description; of these, 87.3% declared themselves
Mapuche.[60]although most show varying degrees of miscegenation.[58]

### Immigration

<IMG>

<IMG>

German influence is visible in southern Chile: Puerto Varas Church.

Immigrants were important to the evolution of Chilean society and Chile as a
nation. Basque families arrived from Spain and regions in the south of France.
Who migrated to Chile in the 18th century vitalized the economy and joined the
old Castilian aristocracy to become the political elite that still dominates
the country.[61] Chileans of Basque descent are estimated at 10% (1,600,000)
or as high as 27% (4,500,000) of the Chilean population.[62][63][64][65][66]
Some non-Spanish European immigrants arrived in Chile mainly to the northern
and southern extremities of the country during the 19th and 20th centuries,
including English, Germans, Irish, Italians, French, Croatians, and former
Yugoslavians.[67][68] The prevalence of non-Hispanic European surnames among
the governing body of modern Chile are a testament to their disproportionate
contribution and influence on the country. Also worth mentioning are the
Croatians, were the most numerous Chile has an estimated 380,000 with the
highest number of descendants of Croats.[69][70] and especially Palestinian
communities, the latter being the largest colony of that people outside of the
Arab world.[71][72][73]The volume of immigrants from neighboring countries to
Chile during those same periods was of a similar value.[68]

After independence and during the republican era, English and Irish
descendants between 350,000 to 420,000.[74], Italian, and French merchants
established themselves in the growing cities of Chile and incidentally joined
the political or economic elites of the country. In 1848 an important and
sizable German immigration took place, laying the foundations of a present
German-Chilean community. Sponsored by the Chilean government with aims of
colonising the southern region. These Germans (which included German-speaking
Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians), markedly influenced the cultural
composition of the southern of Chile. During the second half of the 19th
century was exceptional. Small numbers of displaced eastern European Jews and
Christian Syrians and Palestinians fleeing the Ottoman Empire arrived in
Chile. Today they spearhead financial and small manufacturing operations.[75]
Greeks have also immigrated to Chile and have formed a notable ethnic
identity[76] .Greeks Estimated to be descendants from 90,000 to 120,000[77]
Most of them live either in the Santiago area or in the Antofagasta area.
Chile is one of the 5 countries with more descendants of Greeks in the
world.[78]

European immigration, and to a lesser degree in the Middle East, produced
during the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (large
"waves" in America), after corresponding to the Atlantic coasts of the
Southern Cone ( that is, Argentina, Uruguay and South Brazil), was the most
significant Latin America is favored mainly by the intense traffic that is
produced through extreme south of the country until the opening of the Panama
Canal in 1920, although other numbers came from Argentina, across the
Cordillera.

Currently, immigration from neighboring countries to Chile is greatest.[79]
[80] Chileâs 2002 census counted 184,464 immigrants in the country, 26
percent of whom were from Argentina, 21 percent from Peru and 6 percent from
Bolivia.[81] Emigration of Chileans has decreased during the last decade: It
is estimated that 857,781 Chileans live abroad, 50.1% of those being in
Argentina, 13.3% in the United States, 8.8% in Brazil, 4.9% in Sweden, and
around 2% in Australia.[82][83]

### Religion

Main article: Religion in Chile

According to the most recent census (2002), 70 percent of the population over
age 14 identify as Roman Catholic and 15.1 percent as evangelical. In the
census, the term "evangelical" referred to all non-Catholic Christian churches
with the exception of the Orthodox Church (Greek, Persian, Serbian, Ukrainian,
and Armenian), the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons),
Seventh-day Adventists, and Jehovah's Witnesses. Approximately 90 percent of
evangelicals are Pentecostal. Wesleyan, Lutheran, Reformed Evangelical,
Presbyterian, Anglican, Episcopalian, Baptist, and Methodist churches are also
present.[84]

The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies
contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels
protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private
actors.[84]

Church and state are officially separate. The 1999 law on religion prohibits
religious discrimination; however, the Catholic Church enjoys a privileged
status and occasionally receives preferential treatment. Government officials
attend Catholic events and also major Protestant and Jewish ceremonies.[84]

The Government observes Christmas, Good Friday, the Feast of the Virgin of
Carmen, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the Feast of the Assumption, All
Saints' Day, and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception as national
holidays.[84] The government has recently declared October 31st, a public
national holiday, in honor of the Protestant churches of the country.[85][86]

### Languages

#### Spanish

Main article: Chilean Spanish

The Spanish spoken in Chile is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of
neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and 's' sounds
are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only
very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences
in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the
country. The fact that the Chilean population essentially was formed in a
relatively small section of the center of the country and then migrated in
modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of
differentiation, which is now maintained by the national reach of radio and
especially of television. The media diffuse and homogenize colloquial
expressions.[87]

German and Croatian is spoken in southern Chile.[88]

English language learning and teaching is popular among students, academics
and professionals,[citation needed] with some English words being absorbed and
appropriated into everyday Spanish speech.[89]

#### Indigenous languages

Main article: Languages of Chile

There are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: Mapudungun, Quechua
and Rapa Nui. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the lingua
franca and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some
now extinct or close to extinction.[90]

## Government and politics

Main article: Politics of Chile

<IMG>

The Constitution of Chile was approved in a highly irregular national
plebiscite in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto
Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the
1988 plebiscite, the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future
amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos
signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These
include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and senators for life,
granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the
armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.[91]

Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on December 11,
2005. None of the four presidential candidates won more than 50% of the vote.
As a result, the top two vote-gettersâcenter-left ConcertaciÃ³n coalition's
Michelle Bachelet and center-right Alianza coalition's SebastiÃ¡n
PiÃ±eraâcompeted in a run-off election on January 15, 2006, which Michelle
Bachelet won. She was sworn in on March 11, 2006. This was Chile's fourth
presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All four have been
judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving
consecutive terms.

The Congress of Chile has a 38-seat Senate and a 120-member Chamber of
Deputies. Senators serve for 8 years with staggered terms, while deputies are
elected every 4 years. The current Senate has a 20-18 split in favor of pro-
government senators. The last congressional elections were held on December
11, 2005, concurrently with the presidential election. The current lower
houseâthe Chamber of Deputiesâcontains 63 members of the governing center-
left coalition and 57 from the center-right opposition. The Congress is
located in the port city of ValparaÃ­so, about 140 kilometres (84 mi) west of
the capital, Santiago.

Chile's congressional elections are governed by a binomial system that rewards
large representations. Therefore, there are only two senate and two deputy
seats apportioned to each electoral district, parties are forced to form wide
coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (ConcertaciÃ³n and
Alianza) split most of the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition
ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1
does the winning coalition gain both seats. In the 2001 congressional
elections, the conservative Independent Democratic Union surpassed the
Christian Democrats for the first time to become the largest party in the
lower house. In the 2005 parliamentary election, both leading parties, the
Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their
respective allies Socialist Party (which became the biggest party in the
ConcertaciÃ³n block) and National Renewal in the right-wing alliance. The
Communist Party again failed to gain any seats in the election.

Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of
military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the Supreme Court of Chile. In
June 2005, Chile completed a nation-wide overhaul of its criminal justice
system.[92] The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an
adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.

### Defense

Main article: Military of Chile

Chile's Armed Forces are subject to civilian control exercised by the
president through the Minister of Defense. The president has the authority to
remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces.[7]

#### Army

The commander in chief of the Chilean Army is General Oscar Izurieta Ferrer.
The Chilean Army is 45,000 strong and is organized with an Army headquarters
in Santiago, seven divisions throughout its territory, an Air Brigade in
Rancagua, and a Special Forces Command in Colina. The Chilean Army is one of
the most professional and technologically advanced armies in Latin America.[7]

#### Navy

Admiral Rodolfo Codina directs the 21,773-person Navy [93], including 2,500
Marines. Of the fleet of 29 surface vessels, only eight are operational major
combatants (frigates). Those ships are based in Valparaiso. [94] The Navy
operates its own aircraft for transport and patrol; there are no Navy fighter
or bomber aircraft. The Navy also operates four submarines based in
Talcahuano.[7] [95]

#### Air Force

Gen. Ricardo Ortega Perrier heads a force of 12,500. Air assets are
distributed among five air brigades headquartered in Iquique, Antofagasta,
Santiago, Puerto Montt, and Punta Arenas. The Air Force also operates an
airbase on King George Island, Antarctica. The Air Force took delivery of the
final 2 of 10 F-16s, all purchased from the U.S., in March 2007. Chile also
took delivery in 2007 of a number of reconditioned Block 15 F-16s from the
Netherlands, bringing to 18 the total of F-16s purchased from the Dutch.[7]

#### Carabineros

After the military coup in September 1973, the Chilean national police
(Carabineros) were incorporated into the Defense Ministry. With the return of
democratic government, the police were placed under the operational control of
the Interior Ministry but remained under the nominal control of the Defense
Ministry. Gen. Eduardo Gordon is the head of the national police force of
40,964[96] men and women who are responsible for law enforcement, traffic
management, narcotics suppression, border control, and counter-terrorism
throughout Chile.[7]

### Foreign relations

Since the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active
involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged
the dominance of Peru's port of Callao for preeminence in the Pacific trade
routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the Peru-
Bolivian Confederation (1836-39) in the War of the Confederation. The war
dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second
international war, the War of the Pacific (1879-83), further increased Chile's
regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.[14]

During the nineteenth century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with
Britain, a country that had a decisive influence on the organization of the
navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a
decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom
years at the turn of the century. German influence came from the organization
and training of the army by Prussians.[14]

On June 26, 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United
Nations being among 50 countries that signed the United Nations Charter in San
Francisco, California.[97][98][99] With the military coup of 1973, Chile
became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.[14]

Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in
the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent
position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a
Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of
American States in May 2005. Chile is currently serving on the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, and the 2007-2008 chair of the
board is Chile's ambassador to the IAEA, Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an
active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping
activities. It is currently bidding for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council.
Chile hosted the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 2002 and the APEC
summit and related meetings in 2004. It also hosted the Community of
Democracies ministerial in April 2005 and the Ibero-American Summit in
November 2007. An associate member of Mercosur and a full member of APEC,
Chile has been an important actor on international economic issues and
hemispheric free trade.[7]

The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It
settled its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s. Chile and
Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to reacquire
territory it lost to Chile in 1879-83 War of the Pacific. The two countries
maintain consular relations and are represented at the Consul General
level.[7]

During the period between early agricultural settlements and to the late pre-
Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was
influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the
north. While southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities.
Through the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early
Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other
European influences, primarily English, French, and German began in the 19th
century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the
Bavarian style rural architecture and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities
such as Valdivia, Frutillar, Puerto Varas, Osorno, Temuco, PucÃ³n and Puerto
Montt.[100][101][102][103][104]

### Music and dance

Music in Chile ranges from folkloric music , popular music and also to
classical music. Its large geography generates different musical expressions
in the north, center and south of the country, including also Easter Island
and Mapuche music [105]. The national dance is the cueca. Another form of
traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from
music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by
an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody. Between 1950 and
1970 appears a rebirth in folk music leading by groups such as Los de Ramon
and Los Huasos Quincheros among others [106] with composers such as Raul de
Ramon, Violeta Parra, Nicanor Molinare and others [107]. In the mid-1960s
native musical forms were revitalized by the Parra family with the Nueva
CanciÃ³n Chilena, which was associated with political activists and reformers
such as Victor Jara, and by the folk singer and researcher on folklore and
Chilean ethnography, Margot Loyola.

### Literature

Chileans call their country paÃ­s de poetasâcountry of
poets.[108][109]Gabriela Mistral was the first Chilean to win a Nobel Prize
for Literature (1945). Chile's most famous poet, however, is Pablo Neruda, who
also won the Nobel Prize for Literature (1971) and is world-renowned for his
extensive library of works on romance, nature, and politics. His three highly
individualistic homes, located in Isla Negra, Santiago and ValparaÃ­so are
popular tourist destinations.

### Cuisine

Chilean cuisine is a reflection of the country's topographical variety,
featuring an assortment of seafood, beef, fruits, and vegetables. Traditional
recipes include cazuela, empanadas, humitas, and curanto.[110]

### Sports

Marcelo RÃ­os was chosen Chilean sportsman of the century.

Chile's most popular sport is association football (soccer). Chile has
appeared in seven FIFA World Cups which includes hosting the 1962 FIFA World
Cup where the national football team finished third. Other results achieved by
the national football team include four finals at the Copa AmÃ©rica, one
silver and two bronze medals at the Pan American Games, a bronze medal at the
2000 Summer Olympics and two third places finishes in the FIFA under-17 and
under-20 youth tournaments. The main soccer clubs are Colo-Colo, CF
Universidad de Chile and CD Universidad CatÃ³lica. Colo-Colo is the country's
most successful club, winning 46 national tournaments and three international
championships, including the coveted Copa Libertadores South American club
tournament.

Tennis is the country's most successful sport. Its national team won the World
Team Cup clay tournament twice in 2003-04, and played the Davis Cup final
against Italy in 1976. At the 2004 Summer Olympics the country captured gold
and bronze in men's singles and gold in men's doubles. Marcelo RÃ­os became
the first Latin American man to reach the number one spot in the ATP singles
rankings in 1998. Anita Lizana won the US Open in 1937, becoming the first
women from Latin America to win a grand slam tournament. Luis Ayala was twice
a runner-up at the French Open and both RÃ­os and Fernando GonzÃ¡lez reached
the Australian Open men's singles finals.

At the Olympic Games Chile boasts two gold medals (tennis), seven silver
medals (athletics, equestrian, boxing, shooting and tennis) and four bronze
medals (tennis, boxing and football).

Rodeo is the country's national sport and is practiced in the more rural areas
of the country. A sport similar to hockey called chueca was played by the
Mapuche people during the Spanish conquest. Skiing and snowboarding are
practiced at ski centers located in the Central Andes, while surfing is
popular at some coastal towns.

Polo is professionally practiced within Chile and in 2008 Chile achieved top
prize in the World Polo Championship a tournament where the country has earned
both second and third places medals in previous editions.

Popular among Chileans is basketball a sport in which the Andean country has
earned a bronze medal in the first men's FIBA World Championship held in 1950
and winning a second bronze medal when Chile hosted the 1959 FIBA World
Championship. Chile hosted the first FIBA World Championship for Women in 1953
finishing the tournament with the silver medal.

San Pedro de Atacama.

Tourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades.
In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6%, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of
which 1.5 billion is attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National
Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country. Most
of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly
Argentina; followed by a growing number from the United States, Europe, and
Brazil with a growing number of Asians from South Korea and PR China.[111]

Easter Island.

The main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the
extreme zones of the country: San Pedro de Atacama, in the north, is very
popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture,
the altiplano lakes, and the Valley of the Moon. In Putre, also in the North,
there is the ChungarÃ¡ Lake, as well as the Parinacota and the Pomerape
volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the
central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute, like
Portillo and Valle Nevado. In the south, the main tourist sites are the
ChiloÃ© Archipelago and Patagonia, which includes Laguna San Rafael National
Park, with its many glaciers, and the Torres del Paine National Park. The
central port city of ValparaÃ­so, with its unique architecture, is also
popular. Finally, Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean is one of the main
Chilean tourist destinations.

Torres del Paine.

For locals, tourism is concentrated mostly in the summer (December to March),
and mainly in the coastal beach towns. Arica, Iquique, Antofagasta, La Serena
and Coquimbo are the main summer centres in the north, and PucÃ³n on the
shores of Lake Villarrica is the main one in the south. Because of its
proximity to Santiago, the coast of the ValparaÃ­so Region, with its many
beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. ViÃ±a del Mar,
ValparaÃ­so's northern affluent neighbor, is popular because of its beaches,
casino, and its annual song festival, the most important musical event in
Latin America.

In November 2005, the government launched a campaign under the brand "Chile:
All Ways Surprising," intended to promote the country internationally for both
business and tourism.[112]

A red copihue.

The national flower is the copihue (Lapageria rosea, Chilean bellflower),
which grows in the woods of southern Chile.

The coat of arms depicts the two national animals: the condor (Vultur gryphus,
a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the huemul (Hippocamelus
bisulcus, an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend Por la razÃ³n
o la fuerza (By right or might or By reason or by force).

The flag of Chile consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and
red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-
side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the
center representing a guide to progress and honor; blue symbolizes the sky,
white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to
achieve independence.
