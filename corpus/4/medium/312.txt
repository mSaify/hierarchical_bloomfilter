Budapest (pronounced /Ëb(j)u:dÉËpÉst/, also /ËbÊ-/; Hungarian
pronunciation: [ËbudÉpÉÊt] ; names in other languages) is the capital city
of Hungary.[1] As the largest city of Hungary, it serves as the country's
principal political, cultural, commercial, industrial, and transportation
center[2] and is considered an important hub in Central Europe.[3] In 2008,
Budapest had 1,702,297 inhabitants[4], down from a mid-1980s peak of 2.1
million, with an official agglomeration of 2,451,418[5]. The city covers an
area of 525 square kilometres (202.7 sq mi)[6] within the city limits.
Budapest became a single city occupying both banks of the river Danube with
the unification on 17 November 1873, of right-bank (west) Buda and Ãbuda (Old
Buda) together with Pest on the left (east) bank.[7] [6]

Aquincum, originally a Celtic settlement,[8] was the direct ancestor of
Budapest,[9] becoming the Roman capital of Lower Pannonia.[8] Magyars arrived
in the territory[10] in the 9th century. Their first settlement was pillaged
by the Mongols in 1241-42.[11] The re-established town became one of the
centers of Renaissance humanist culture[12] in the 15th century.[13] Following
nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule,[14] development of the region entered a new
age of prosperity in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Budapest became a global
city after the 1873 unification.[15] It also became the second capital of
Austria-Hungary, a great power that dissolved in 1918. Budapest was the focal
point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Hungarian Soviet Republic of
1919, Operation Panzerfaust in 1944, the Battle of Budapest of 1945, and the
Revolution of 1956.

Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe,[16][1][10][17]
its World Heritage Sites include the banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle
Quarter, AndrÃ¡ssy Avenue, and the Millennium Underground Railway, the first
on the European continent.[16][18] In addition, the largest thermal water cave
system in the world was discovered under Budapest in 2008.[19]

The city attracts over 20 million visitors a year.[20] The headquarters of the
European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) will be in Budapest.[21]

Medieval streets and houses of Buda Castle

  
The first settlement on the territory of Budapest was Ak-Ink (English:
Abundant Water) built by Celts[8] before the birth of Christ. It was later
occupied by the Romans. The Roman settlement - Aquincum \- became the main
city of Lower Pannonia[8] in 106 AD[8]. The Romans constructed roads,
amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military
camp[22].

The Hungarians led by ÃrpÃ¡d settled in the territory at the end of the 9th
century[23][10], and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of
Hungary[10]. Research places the probable residence of the ÃrpÃ¡ds an early
place of central power near what became Budapest. [24] The Tatar invasion in
the 13th century quickly proved that defence is difficult on a plain[6][10].
King BÃ©la IV of Hungary therefore ordered the construction of reinforced
stone walls around the towns[10] and set his own royal palace[11] on the top
of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361[11] it became the capital of
Hungary[6].

Buda Castle during the Middle Ages.

The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of
Matthias Corvinus of Hungary[6]. The Italian Renaissance had a great influence
on the city[6]. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana[6], was Europe's
greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific
works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the Vatican Library[6].
After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in PÃ©cs in 1367[25]
the second one was established in Ãbuda in 1395[25]. The first Hungarian book
was printed in Buda in 1473[26].

The Turkish occupation lasted for more than 140 years[6]. The Turks
constructed some fine bathing facilities here[10]. The unoccupied western part
of the country became part of the Habsburg Empire as Royal Hungary.

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed campaign
was started to enter the Hungarian capital. This time, the Holy League's army
was twice a large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch,
Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and
Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artilleryman, and
officers, the Christian forces reconquered Buda, and in the next few years,
all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near TimiÅoara (TemesvÃ¡r),
were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz these territorial
changes were officially recognized, and in 1718 the entire Kingdom of Hungary
was removed from Ottoman rule.

The city was destroyed during the battle[6]. Hungary was then incorporated
into the Habsburg Empire[6].

The nineteenth century was dominated by the Hungarians' struggle for
independence[6] and modernization. The national insurrection against the
Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated a little
more than a year later.

1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-
Hungary.

This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise
which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest,
lasting until World War I. In 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with
the third part, Ãbuda (Ancient Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of
Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political,
economic, trade and cultural hub.

the first underground in Continental Europe

World War I brought the Golden Age to an end. In 1918 Austria-Hungary lost the
war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic. In 1920
the Treaty of Trianon finalized the country's partition, as a result, Hungary
lost over two-thirds of its territory, about two-thirds of its inhabitants
under the treaty including 3.3 million out of 10 million ethnic
Hungarians.[27][28]

In 1944, towards the end of World War II, Budapest was partly destroyed by
British and American air raids. From 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the
city was besieged during the Battle of Budapest. Budapest suffered major
damage caused by the attacking Soviet troops and the defending German and
Hungarian troops. All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. More than 38,000
civilians lost their lives during the conflict.

Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died
through Nazi and Arrow Cross genocide during 1944 and early 1945.[29] Despite
this, modern day Budapest has the highest number of Jewish citizens per capita
of any European city.

In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People's Republic. The new Communist
government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former
regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were
destroyed.

In 1956, peaceful demonstrations in Budapest led to the outbreak of the
Hungarian Revolution. The Stalinist dictatorship collapsed after mass
demonstrations, but Soviet tanks entered Budapest to crush the revolt.
Fighting continued until early November, leaving more than 3000 dead.

From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as
"the happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc, and much of the wartime damage
to the city was finally repaired. Work on ErzsÃ©bet Bridge, the last to be
rebuilt, was finished in 1965. In the early 1970s, Budapest Metro's East-West
M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1982. In 1987, Buda
Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World
Heritage Sites. Andrassy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway,
HÅsÃ¶k tere and VÃ¡rosliget) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the
1980s the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant
decrease in habitants occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the
neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county. In the last decades of the 20th
century the political changes of 1989-90 concealed changes in civil society
and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were
taken down from public places, into Memento Park.

## [edit] Geography

A view of Pest from the Buda side of the Danube

The 525km2 area of Budapest lies in central Hungary surrounded by settlements
of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends 25 and 29 kilometers
in the north-south, east-west direction respectively. The Danube enters the
city from the north; later it encircles two islands, Ãbuda Island and
Margaret Island[6]. The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the
Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city
limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is only 230 m (755
ft) wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of
the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly[6]. Pest's terrain rises with a
slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same
altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably GellÃ©rt Hill and Castle Hill. The
Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created
speleothems, the most famous ones being the PÃ¡lvÃ¶lgyi cave and the
SzemlÅhegyi cave. The hills were formed in the Triassic Era. The highest
point of the hills and of Budapest is JÃ¡nos hill, at 527 meters above sea
level. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is 96 meters above see
level. The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected.

### [edit] Climate

Main article: Climate of Budapest

Budapest has a temperate, transitional climate - somewhere between the mild,
rainy weather of Transdanubia, the variable continental climate of the flat
and open Great Plain to the east and the almost sub-Mediterranean weather of
the south.[30].

Main article: List of districts in Budapest

Originally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the
unification of the three cities in 1873. On 1 January, 1950 Budapest was
united with several neighboring towns and the number of its districts was
raised to 22 (Greater Budapest). At that time there were changes both in the
order of districts and in their sizes. Now there are 23 districts, 6 in Buda,
16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them. Each district can be
associated with one or more city parts named after former towns within
Budapest.

Hungarian Parliament Building

See also: List of sights and historic places in Budapest

The neo-Gothic Parliament, containing amongst other things the Hungarian Crown
Jewels. Saint Stephen's Basilica, where the Holy Right Hand of the founder of
Hungary, King Saint Stephen is on display. The Hungarian cuisine and cafÃ©
culture: for example, Gerbeaud CafÃ©, and the SzÃ¡zÃ©ves, Biarritz, Fortuna,
AlabÃ¡rdos, Arany Szarvas, KÃ¡rpÃ¡tia and the world famous MÃ¡tyÃ¡s Pince
Restaurants. There are Roman remains at the Aquincum Museum, and historic
furniture at the NagytÃ©tÃ©ny Castle Museum.

The Castle Hill, the River Danube embankments and the whole of AndrÃ¡ssy Ãºt
have been officially recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

<IMG>

<IMG>

The Holy Crown of Hungary, a key symbol of Hungary

Castle Hill and the Castle District; there are three churches here, six
museums, and a host of interesting buildings, streets and squares. The former
Royal Palace is one of the symbols of Hungary â and has been the scene of
battles and wars ever since the thirteenth century. Nowadays it houses two
impressive museums and the National SzÃ©chenyi Library. The nearby SÃ¡ndor
Palace contains the offices and official residence of the President of
Hungary. The seven-hundred year-old Matthias Church is one of the jewels of
Budapest. Next to it is an equestrian statue of the first king of Hungary,
King Saint Stephen, and behind that is the Fisherman's Bastion, from where
opens out a panoramic view of the whole city. Statues of the Turul, the
mythical guardian bird of Hungary, can be found in both the Castle District
and the Twelfth District.

In Pest, arguably the most important sight is AndrÃ¡ssy Ãºt. As far as KodÃ¡ly
KÃ¶rÃ¶nd and Oktogon both sides are lined with large shops and flats built
close together. Between there and Heroesâ Square the houses are detached and
altogether grander. Under the whole runs continental Europeâs oldest
Underground railway, most of whose stations retain their original appearance.
Heroesâ Square is dominated by the Millenary Monument, with the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier in front. To the sides are the Museum of Fine Arts and the
Palace of Arts, and behind City Park opens out, with Vajdahunyad Castle. One
of the jewels of AndrÃ¡ssy Ãºt is the Hungarian State Opera House. Statue
Park, a theme park with striking statues of the Communist era, is located just
outside the main city and is accessible by public transport.

The city is home to the largest synagogue in Europe (DohÃ¡ny Street
Synagogue)[35], the largest medicinal bath in Europe (SzÃ©chenyi Medicinal
Bath) and the third largest Parliament building in the world, once the largest
in the world. The third largest church in Europe (Esztergom Basilica) and the
second largest Baroque castle in the world (GÃ¶dÃ¶llÅ) are in the vicinity.

Seven islands can be found on the Danube: HajÃ³gyÃ¡ri sziget (literal
translation: Shipyard Island), Margit-sziget (Margaret Island), and Csepel
sziget (the northernmost part of this island belonging to Budapest is a
separate district of the city, the XXI., while the other islands are parts of
other districts, the III. and XIII. respectively), Palotai-sziget (in fact,
it's a peninsula today), NÃ©psziget (connected to the above, but mostly
surrounded by water), HÃ¡ros-sziget and MolnÃ¡r-sziget.

Notable islands:

  * Margit-sziget is a 2.5 km (1.6 mi) long island and 0.965 square kilometres (238 acres) in area. The island mostly consists of a park and is a popular recreational area for tourists and locals alike. The island lies between bridges Margaret Bridge (south) and ÃrpÃ¡d Bridge (north). Dance clubs, Swimming pools, an Aqua park, athletic and fitness centres, bicycle and running tracks can be found around the Island. During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting. In the summer (generally on the weekends) mostly young people go to the island at night to party in its terraces, or to recreate with a bottle of alcohol on a bench or on the grass (this form of entertainment is sometimes referred to as bench-partying).
  * Csepel-sziget [ËtÊÉpÉlsigÉt] or Csepel Island is the largest island of the River Danube in Hungary. It is 48 km (30 mi) long; its width is 6â8 km (3.75â5 mi) and its area comprises 257 km2 (99 sq mi), whereas only the northern tip is inside the city limits.
  * HajÃ³gyÃ¡ri-sziget [ËhÉjo:Éa:ri sigÉt] (or Ãbudai-sziget) is a man built island, located in the third district. This island hosts many activities such as: wake-boarding, jet-skiing during the day, and dance clubs during the night. This is the island where the famous Sziget Festival takes place, hosting hundreds of performances per year and now around 400,000 visitors in its last edition. Many building projects are taking place to make this island into one of the biggest entertainment centres of Europe, the plan is to build Apartment buildings, hotels, casinos and a marina.
  * Luppa-sziget is the smallest island of Budapest, located in the north region.

## [edit] Transport

### [edit] Airport

<IMG>

<IMG>

Budapest Ferihegy International Airport

Budapest Ferihegy International Airport, which has 3 passenger terminals:
Ferihegy 1, which tends to serve the many discount airlines now flying to and
from Budapest, Ferihegy 2/A and Ferihegy 2/B. Terminal 2/C is planned to be
built. The airport is located to the east of the centre in the XVIII. district
in PestszentlÅrinc.

### [edit] Roads

Budapest is the most important Hungarian road terminus; all the major highways
end there. Budapest is also a major railway terminus.

Ring road M0 around Budapest is made and allows people to go around Budapest
from East to West and from North to South, however there is no way from West
to North - you only need to go around to the South.

### [edit] Public transport

<IMG>

<IMG>

Map of the Budapest Metro

Budapest public transport is provided by BKV[36], the company operates buses,
trolleybuses, trams, suburban railway lines, the metro, a boat service, a
cogwheel railway and a chairlift, called LibegÅ.

Budapest's tram network is extensive, and reliable despite poor track
infrastructure and an ageing fleet. Routes 4 and 6 combined form the busiest
traditional city tram line in the world, with the world's longest passenger
trams (54-metre (177 ft) long Siemens Combino) running at 60 to 90 second
intervals at peak time and 3â4 minutes off-peak and usually packed with
people.

Day services operate from 4:30 a.m. until 11:30 p.m. each day. Night traffic
(a reduced overnight service) has a reputation for being excellent[citation
needed].

There are three metro lines and a fourth is currently under construction. The
Yellow line, built in 1896, is one of the oldest subway lines in the world,
following London Underground and the Istanbul Metro that were built
respectively in 1863 and 1875.

### [edit] Special vehicles

<IMG>

<IMG>

Budapest Castle Hill Funicular

Beside metros, suburban rails, buses, trams and boats, there are a couple of
less usual vehicles in Budapest:

  * trolleybus (trolibusz) on several lines in Pest
  * funicular (siklÃ³); the Castle Hill Funicular between the Chain Bridge and Buda Castle
  * cyclecar (bringÃ³hintÃ³) for rent in Margaret Island
  * chairlift (libegÅ)
  * rack railway (fogaskerekÅ± vasÃºt); the Budapest Cog-wheel Railway
  * children's railway (gyermekvasÃºt)[36]

The latter three vehicles run among Buda hills.

### [edit] Railway

Main articles: MÃV and HÃV

Hungarian main-line railways are operated by MÃV. There are three main
railway termini in Budapest, Keleti (eastern), Nyugati (westbound), and DÃ©li
(southbound), operating both domestic and international rail services.
Budapest was one of the main stops of the Orient Express until 2001, when the
service was cut back to Paris-Vienna.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Nyugati Railway Station

There is also a suburban rail service in and around Budapest, operated under
the name HÃV.

### [edit] Waterways

The river Danube flows through Budapest on its way to the Black Sea. The river
is easily navigable and so Budapest has historically been a major commercial
port (at Csepel). In the summer months a scheduled hydrofoil service operates
up the Danube to Vienna.
