The 2006 FIFA World Cup was the 18th instance of the FIFA World Cup, the
quadrennial international football world championship tournament. It was held
from 9 June to 9 July 2006 in Germany, which won the right to host the event
in July 2000. Teams representing 198 national football associations from all
six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began
in September 2003. Thirty-one teams qualified from this process, along with
the host nation, Germany, for the finals tournament.

The tournament was won by Italy, who claimed their fourth World Cup title.
They defeated France 5â3 in a penalty shootout in the final, after extra
time had finished in a 1â1 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3â1 to finish
third.

The 2006 World Cup stands as one of the most watched events in television
history, garnering an estimated 26.29 billion non-unique viewers, compiled
over the course of the tournament. The final attracted an estimated audience
of 715.1 million people.[1] The 2006 World Cup ranks fourth in non-unique
viewers, behind the 1994, the 2002, and the 1990 FIFA World Cups.[2] As the
winner, Italy will represent the World in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.

## Host selection

Main article: FIFA World Cup hosts

The vote to choose the hosts of the 2006 tournament was held in July 2000 in
ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had
withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco.[3]
Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with
the least votes. The first two rounds were held on 6 July, and the final round
was held on 7 July. Morocco was the first to be eliminated when it got only
three votes out of a possible 24; England was eliminated in the second round
with only two votes.[4] Finally, Germany won the final round of voting 12â11
over South Africa, but the success of Germany's bid was marred by a hoax
bribery affair which even led to calls for a re-vote.[5] On the night before
the vote, German satirical magazine Titanic sent letters to FIFA
representatives, offering gifts in exchange for their vote for Germany.
Oceania delegate Charles Dempsey, who had been instructed to support South
Africa, abstained, citing "intolerable pressure" on the eve of the vote.[6]
Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with
a 12â12 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African
bid,[7] would have had to cast the deciding vote.[8]

## Qualification

Qualifying countries

198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.[9] Germany, the host
nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals
places divided among the continental confederations. This was the first World
Cup for which the title holders were not granted automatic qualification.
Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams
(Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia),
and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The
remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and
between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).

Eight nations qualified for the finals for the first time: Angola, CÃ´te
d'Ivoire, Czech Republic, Ghana, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine and Serbia
& Montenegro. Czech Republic and Ukraine were making their first appearance as
independent nations, but had previously been represented as part of
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union respectively; Serbia & Montenegro had
competed as Yugoslavia in 1998, as well as making up part of Yugoslav teams
from 1930 to 1990. For the first time since the 1982 World Cup, all six
confederations were represented at the finals tournament.

## Venues

Germany in 2006 had a plethora of football stadia which satisfied FIFA's
minimum capacity of 40,000 for World Cup matches. The still-standing
Olympiastadion in Munich (69,250) was not used even though FIFA's regulations
allow one city to use two stadia; DÃ¼sseldorf's LTU Arena (51,500), Bremen's
Weserstadion (43,000) and MÃ¶nchengladbach's Borussia-Park (46,249) were also
unemployed during the tournament.

Twelve stadia were selected to host the World Cup matches. During the
tournament, many of the stadia were known by different names, as FIFA
prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors were also official
FIFA sponsors.[10] For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during
the competition as FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich (or in German: FIFA WM-
Stadion MÃ¼nchen), and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or
covered.[10] These new names are reflected in the table in the brackets. Some
of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup, as FIFA regulations
ban standing room; nonetheless, this was accommodated as several stadiums had
an UEFA 5-star ranking.

## Squads

For more details on this topic, see 2006 FIFA World Cup squads.

Squads for the 2006 World Cup consisted of 23 players, same as the previous
tournament in 2002. Each participating national association had to confirm its
23-player squad by 15 May 2006.[11] Replacement of injured players was
permitted until 24 hours before the team's first match.[citation needed]

## Groups

### Seeds

Further information: 2006 FIFA World Cup seeding

The eight seeded teams for the 2006 tournament were announced on 6 December
2005. The seeds comprised Pot A in the draw. Pot B contained the unseeded
qualifiers from South America, Africa and Oceania; Pot C contained eight of
the nine remaining European teams, excluding Serbia and Montenegro. Pot D
contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia. A special pot
contained Serbia and Montenegro: this was done to ensure that no group
contained three European teams.[12] In the special pot, Serbia and Montenegro
was drawn first, then their group was drawn from the three seeded non-European
nations, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.

It had been predetermined that, as the host, Germany would be placed in Group
A, thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the
draw. FIFA had also announced in advance that Brazil (the defending champion)
would be allocated to Group F.

On 9 December 2005 the draw was held, and the group assignments and order of
matches were determined. After the draw was completed, many football
commentators remarked that Group C appeared to be the group of death.[13][14]
In actuality, however, Argentina and the Netherlands both qualified with a
game to spare with comfortable wins over CÃ´te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and
Serbia and Montenegro respectively.

### Group system

The first round, or group stage, saw the thirty-two teams divided into eight
groups of four teams. Each group was a round-robin of six games, where each
team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams
were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a
defeat. The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the
Round of 16.

#### Ranking criteria

If teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in
order:

  1. Greatest total goal difference in the three group matches
  2. Greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches
  3. If teams remained level after those criteria, a mini-group would be formed from those teams, who would be ranked on: 
    1. Most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie
    2. Greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie
    3. Greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie
  4. If teams remained level after all these criteria, FIFA would hold a drawing of lots

In the original version of the rules for the final tournament, the ranking
criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking
precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in
advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA
and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the
correct criteria.[15]

In any event, the final tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on
points: Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C; Tunisia and
Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H. Both of these ties were resolved on total
goal difference. Also, in both cases the teams had tied their match, so the
order of ranking criteria made no difference.

## Finals tournament

<IMG>

2006 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Munich

The finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June. The 32 teams were
divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed
in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would
advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June. In
total, 64 games were played.

### Hosting

Although Germany failed to win the Cup, the tournament was considered a great
success for Germany in general. Germany also experienced a sudden increase in
patriotic spirit with flag waving, traditionally frowned upon by German
society since World War II, whenever the German team played.[16]

### Traditional powers dominate

Despite early success by Australia, Ecuador and Ghana, the tournament marked a
return to dominance of the traditional football powers. Four years after a
2002 tournament in which teams from North America (United States), Africa
(Senegal), and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and
Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout
stages, and none of the quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South
America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-final round, with
Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders.[17]
Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-
European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982
tournaments).

### Scoring

Despite the early goals that flooded the group stages, the knock-out phase had
a much lower goals per match ratio. A prime example of the dearth of goals was
Portugal, which only scored in the 23rd minute of the Round of 16, and did not
score again until the 88th minute of the third place play-off. Italy, Germany,
Argentina, Brazil and France were the only teams to score more than one goal
in a knockout match. Germany was one of the exceptions to the rule, tending to
play an attacking style of football throughout the knock-out stage, which was
reflected by their being the team that scored the most goals (14).

Germany's Miroslav Klose scored 5 goals to claim the Golden Boot, the lowest
total to win the prize since 1962. No other player scored more than three
goals. No player from the winning Italian squad scored more than two goals,
though ten different players had scored for the team, tying the record for the
most goalscorers from any one team.

For the first time ever in the FIFA World Cup, the first and last goals of the
tournament were scored by defenders. Philipp Lahm, the German wingback, scored
the opener against Costa Rica after only 5 minutes of the opening match. In
the final, Marco Materazzi, the Italian centre back, out-jumped Patrick Vieira
and headed in the last goal of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

### Unprecedented number of cards

In comparison to earlier World Cups, the tournament was notable for the number
of yellow and red cards given out, breaking the record set by the 1998 World
Cup. Players received a record-breaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards,
with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in
the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands (see the Battle of
Nuremberg). Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final
and semi-final matches, respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that
he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier
accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their
teams make it that far. The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll
mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip Å imuniÄ in their
match against Australia.

The high number of yellow and red cards shown also prompted discussion about
the referees. FIFA Officials and President Sepp Blatter received criticism for
allegedly making rules too rigid and taking discretion away from referees.[18]

#### Group A

Main article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group A

In the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played an
entertaining game which ended 4â2 for the host in the highest scoring
opening match in the tournament's history. Germany went on to win the Group A
after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3â0. Despite the defeat,
Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland
and Costa Rica 2â0 and 3â0, respectively.

In Group B, England and Sweden managed to push Paraguay into third place after
narrow victories over the South Americans. Trinidad and Tobago earned some
international respect after a tie with Sweden in their opening game and
managing to hold England scoreless for 83 minutes, until goals from
Liverpool's Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard sealed a 2â0 win for the Three
Lions. Sweden qualified for the knockout rounds after drawing 2â2 with
England to maintain their 38-year unbeaten record against their opponents.

Both Argentina and Netherlands qualified from Group C with a game remaining,
with the two-time world champion topping the group on goal difference having
hammered Serbia and Montenegro 6â0 and beating Ivory Coast 2â1. The Dutch
picked up 1â0 and 2â1 victories over Serbia and Montenegro and Ivory
Coast, respectively. Les ÃlÃ©phants defeated Serbia and Montenegro 3â2 in
their final game, in Serbia & Montenegro's last ever international before the

Portugal coasted through in Group D, picking up the maximum number of points,
with Mexico qualifying in second. Iran rued missed chances against Mexico in
their opening 1â3 defeat and were eliminated in their match against
Portugal. They fought hard against the Portuguese, but went down 2â0. Their
last game against Angola ended in 1â1 draw. The Africans had a respectable
first World Cup tournament after earning draws with Mexico (0â0) and Iran.

#### Group E

In Group E, Italy went through to the Round of 16 conceding just one goal (an
own goal) in the group phase against the United States. The Americans bowed
out of the tournament after disappointing results against the Czech Republic
and Ghana, 0â3 and 1â2, respectively, despite a hugely encouraging 1â1
draw (with 9 vs 10 men) against the Azzurri. Tournament debutant Ghana caused
one of the surprises of the tournament, as they joined Italy in the Round of
16, following victories over the Czech Republic and the United States. Daniele
De Rossi was suspended for 4 games following his sending-off against the
Americans.

#### Group F

Main article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group F

Group F included the World Champions Brazil, Croatia, Japan, and Australia.
Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, the Socceroos came from behind
to defeat Japan 3â1, and, despite losing 0â2 to Brazil, a 2â2 draw with
Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a
remarkable game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one
for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll. Australia became the first
ever Oceanian team to reach the knockout stages. The Brazilians won all three
contests to quality first in the group, although their 1-0 win against Croatia
was underwhelming, a goal late in the first-half by KakÃ¡ securing the win .
Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win.

#### Group G

France started slowly in Group G, only managing a scoreless draw against
Switzerland and a 1â1 draw against South Korea. However, with captain
Zinedine Zidane suspended, their 2â0 win against Togo was enough for them to
advance to the knockout round. Les Bleus were joined by the group winners,
Switzerland, who defeated South Korea 2â0, and did not concede a goal in the
tournament. Four points were not enough to see the Koreans through to the
Round of 16 (the only team for which this was the case), while debutants Togo,
after several rows about money and the general dislike amongst the camp of
their star player, Emmanuel Adebayor of Arsenal, exited without a point.

#### Group H

Main article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Group H

Spain dominated Group H, picking up the maximum number of points, scoring 8
goals, and conceding only 1. Ukraine, despite being beaten 4â0 by Spain in
their first World Cup game, took advantage of the weaker opponents to beat
Saudi Arabia 4â0 and scrape past Tunisia 1â0 thanks to a 70th minute
penalty by Andriy Shevchenko, to reach the Round of 16. Saudi Arabia and
Tunisia went out of the tournament having 1 point each, thanks to a 2â2 draw
against each other.

### Knockout stage

Main article: 2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage

The knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament involving the sixteen
teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament. There were four
rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that
round. The successive rounds were: Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals,
Final. There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. For each game
in the knockout stage, a draw was followed by thirty minutes of extra time
(two fifteen minute halves); if scores were still level there would be a
penalty shootout (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to
determine who progressed to the next round. Scores after extra time are
indicated by (a.e.t.), and penalty shoot outs are indicated by (pen.).

#### Round of 16

In the second round, conceding two early goals in the first 12 minutes to
Germany effectively ended the Swedes' hopes of progressing to the quarter-
finals. Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi RodrÃ­guez goal in
extra time put the Albiceleste in the quarterfinals. In a highly controversial
match, Australia's journey ended when Italians were awarded a controversial
penalty deep into the remaining seconds of the match. The Italians had spent
much of the game with only ten men on the field, following an equally
controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi. In a dull 0â0
match, Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the
penalty shootout against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an
unwanted new record in becoming the first team to fail to convert any
penalties in a shootout. Their elimination also meant that they became the
first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals
(and, moreover, the only nation to participate in a World Cup finals
tournament without conceding a goal).

England struggled past Ecuador thanks to a David Beckham free kick, and won
1â0. Brazil won 3â0 against Ghana, in a game which included Ronaldo's
record 15th World Cup goal. Der Spiegel reported that the match was influenced
by an Asian betting syndicate.[19] Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1â0 in
one of the ugliest games in World Cup history. The only goal came courtesy of
a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match, which marked a new World Cup record
with 16 yellow cards and 4 players being sent off for a second bookable
offense. France came from behind to defeat the highly favored Spain 3â1
thanks to goals from Franck RibÃ©ry, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane.

#### Quarter-finals

Germany and Argentina played an entertaining, yet somewhat cautious match,
which ended 1â1 after extra time; the hosts edged out the Argentinians 4â2
on penalties to go through to the semifinals. Another ugly and controversial
match came in Gelsenkirchen, when England faced Portugal. In a match which saw
Wayne Rooney being sent off, Portugal won the penalty shootout 3â1 after a
0â0 draw to reach their first World Cup semi-final since the days of
EusÃ©bio 40 years earlier, and ensure manager Luiz Felipe Scolari's third
consecutive tournament quarter-final win over Sven-Goran Eriksson's England.

Italy comfortably defeated quarter-final debutants Ukraine 3â0. France
eliminated Brazil 1â0 to advance into the semi-finals in a repeat of the
1998 final. Despite the score, Brazil only managed one shot on goal, while
Zinedine Zidane's dribbling earned him Man of the Match and his free-kick to
Thierry Henry resulted in the winning goal.

#### Semi-finals

With Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarter-finals, an all-European
semi-final line up was completed for only the fourth time (after the 1934,
1966 and 1982 tournaments).

The semifinal between Germany and Italy produced an entertaining extra time
period that went scoreless until the 118th minute, when Italy scored twice
through Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero, putting an end to Germany's
undefeated record in Dortmund, and continued their dominace over Die
Nationalelf.

In the second semifinal, Portugal lost to France 1â0 in Munich. The
Portuguese faced a hostile crowd of English and French fans; as Cristiano
Ronaldo was accused of unsportsmanlike behavior. In a repeat of the semi-
finals of Euro 2000, Portugal was narrowly defeated by France, with the
decisive goal being a penalty scored by France captain Zinedine Zidane.

#### Third place play-off

The match began rather slowly, with each side cautiously trying to find each
other's weak spots. The excitement began in the second half when the hosts got
three goals in 20 minutes with the help of 21-year-old left midfielder Bastian
Schweinsteiger. His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with
pace over his head. Only 4 minutes later, Schweinsteiger's free kick 30 meters
from the left of the penalty box, driven low across goal, was connected with
Petit's knee to become an own goal for Portugal. The German did not stop, and
netted his second goal, which swerved away to the keeper's left, on the 78th
minute.

Portugal were strong in possession but lacked punch in attack; unable to
convert 57% possession into goals. Pauleta had two clear chances from 15
meters, but both times hit tame shots that did not trouble keeper Oliver Kahn,
who was playing in his last match for the German national team. Portugal,
however, were to get a consolation goal with the help of substitute LuÃ­s
Figo, who almost immediately provided the precise distribution needed to
unlock the German defence. A cross from the right wing on 88 minutes found
fellow substitute Nuno Gomes at the far post, who dived in for the goal.
Portugal did not manage to score more in the remaining few minutes, and the
game ended 3â1, a result which gave the tournament hosts the bronze medals
and left Portugal in fourth place.

#### Final

Main article: 2006 FIFA World Cup Final

The final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes. Zinedine
Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventh-minute penalty
kick,[20] which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and into the goal.
Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an
Andrea Pirlo corner. Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in
normal time: Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy (he later
had a header disallowed for offside), while France were not awarded a possible
second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box
after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta. They were unable to capitalise,
however, and the score remained at one goal each.

At the end of the regulation 90 minutes, the score was still level at 1â1,
and the match was forced into extra time. Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon
made a potentially game-saving save in extra time when he tipped a Zidane
header over the crossbar. Further controversy ensued near the end of extra
time, when Zidane head-butted Materazzi in the chest in an off-the-ball
incident and was sent off. Extra time produced no further goals and a penalty
shootout followed, which Italy won 5â3. France's David Trezeguet, the man
who scored the Golden Goal against Italy in Euro 2000, was the only player not
to score his penalty; his spot kick hit the crossbar, landed on the goal line
and went out. It was the first all-European final since Italy's triumph over
West Germany in the 1982 World Cup, and the second final, after 1994, to be
decided on penalties. It was also Italy's first world title in 24 years, and
their fourth overall, making them the second most successful World Cup team
ever. The victory also helped Italy top the FIFA World Rankings in February
2007 for the first time since November 1993.
