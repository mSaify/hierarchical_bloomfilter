World map of the Global Peace Index. Countries appearing more blue are ranked
as more peaceful on the Index, countries appearing more red are ranked as less
peaceful.

The Global Peace Index (GPI) is an attempt to measure the relative position of
nationsâ and regionsâ peacefulness. It is maintained by the Institute for
Economics and Peace and developed in consultation with an international panel
of peace experts from peace institutes and think tanks, together with the
Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Sydney, Australia with
data analysed by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The list was launched first
in May 2007 and then recently in May 2008 and is claimed to be the first study
to rank countries around the world according to their peacefulness. The study
is the brainchild of Australian entrepreneur Steve Killelea and is endorsed by
individuals such as the Dalai Lama, archbishop Desmond Tutu, Muhammad Yunus,
economist Jeffrey Sachs, former president of Ireland Mary Robinson and former
US president Jimmy Carter. Factors examined by the authors include internal
factors such as levels of violence and crime within the country and factors in
a country's external relations such as military expenditure and wars.

## [edit] Methodology

The research team was headed by The Economist Intelligence Unit in conjunction
with academics and experts in the field of peace. They measured countries'
peacefulness based on wide range of indicators, 24 in all. A table of the
indicators is below.[1] In the table, UCDP stands for the Uppsala Conflict
Data Program maintained by the University of Uppsala in Sweden, EIU for The
Economist Intelligence Unit, UNSCT for the United Nations Survey of Criminal
Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, ICPS is the International
Center for Prison Studies at King's College London, IISS for the International
Institute for Strategic Studies publication The Military Balance 2007, SIPRI
for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Arms Transfers
Database, and BICC for the Bonn International Center for Conversion.

Indicators not already ranked on a 1 to 5 scale were converted by using the
following formula: x=(x-Min(x))/(Max(x)-Min(x)) where Max(x) and Min(x) are
the highest and lowest values for that indicator of the countries ranked in
the index. The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5
scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the research
team's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two
weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final
score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score.[7]

The main findings of the Global Peace Index are:

  * Peace correlated to indicators such as income, schooling and the level of regional integration
  * Peaceful countries often shared high levels of transparency of government and low corruption
  * Small, stable countries which are part of regional blocks are most likely to get a higher ranking.[8]

Statistical analysis was applied to discover more specific drivers of peace.
Specifically, the research team looked for indicators that were included and
excluded from the index that had high levels of correlation with the overall
score and rank of countries. Among the statistically significant indicators
that were not used in the analysis were the functionality of a country's
government, regional integration, hostility to foreigners, importance of
religion in national life, and GDP per capita.[9]

Notably absent from the 2007 study are Belarus, Iceland, many African nations,
Mongolia, North Korea and Afghanistan. They were not included because reliable
data for the 24 indicators was not available.[10]

## [edit] Criticism and response to criticism

The Economist, in publishing the index, admitted that, "the index will run
into some flak." Specifically, according to The Economist, the weighting of
military expenditure "may seem to give heart to freeloaders: countries that
enjoy peace precisely because others (often the USA) care for their defense."
The true utility of the index may lie not in its specific rankings of
countries now, but in how those rankings change over time, thus tracking when
and how countries become more or less peaceful.[11]

The Peace Index has been criticised for not including indicators specifically
relating to violence against women and children. Riane Eisler, writing in the
Christian Science Monitor, argued that, "to put it mildly, this blind spot
makes the index very inaccurate." She mentions a number of specific cases,
including Egypt, where she claims 90% of women are subject to genital
mutilation, China, where, she says, "female infanticide is still a problem,"
and Chile, where 26% of women "suffered at least one episode of violence by a
partner, according to a 2000 UNICEF study."[12]

The Index has received endorsements from a number of major international
figures, including the Dalai Lama, archbishop Desmond Tutu, Muhammad Yunus and
former United States President Jimmy Carter.[13] Steve Killelea, the
Australian philanthropist who conceived the idea of the Index and created a
definition for the Peace Industry, argues that the Index "is a wake-up call
for leaders around the globe."[14]

## [edit] 2007-2008 Global Peace Index rankings

Nations considered more peaceful have lower index scores. Countries with
rankings in green are in the most peaceful 20% for that year; those in red are
in the bottom 20%.[15]
