A typical assortment of spices used in Indian cuisine

A spice is a dried seed, fruit, root, bark, leaf, or vegetative substance used
in nutritionally insignificant quantities as a food additive for the purpose
of flavor, color, or as a preservative that kills harmful bacteria or prevents
their growth.[1]

Many of these substances are also used for other purposes, such as medicine,
religious rituals, cosmetics, perfumery or eating as vegetables. For example,
turmeric is also used as a preservative; licorice as a medicine; garlic as a
vegetable. In some cases they are referred to by different terms.

In the kitchen, spices are distinguished from herbs, which are leafy, green
plant parts used for flavoring purposes. Herbs, such as basil or oregano, may
be used fresh, and are commonly chopped into smaller pieces. Spices, however,
are dried and often ground or grated into a powder. Small seeds, such as
fennel and mustard seeds, are used both whole and in powder form.

## [edit] Classification and types

See also: List of herbs and spices

Spices can be grouped as:

  * Dried fruits or seeds, such as fennel, mustard, and black pepper.
  * Arils, such as mace.
  * Barks, such as cinnamon and cassia.
  * Dried buds, such as cloves.
  * Stamens, such as saffron.
  * Roots and rhizomes, such as turmeric, ginger and galingale.
  * Resins, such as asa foetida

Herbs, such as bay, basil, and thyme are not, strictly speaking, spices,
although they have similar uses in flavouring food. The same can be said of
vegetables such as onions and garlic.

## [edit] Early history

The earliest evidence of the use of spice by man was around 50,000 B.C. The
spice trade developed throughout the Middle East in around 2000 BC with
cinnamon, Indonesian cinnamon and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for
embalming and their need for exotic herbs helped stimulate world trade. In
fact, the word spice comes from the same root as species, meaning kinds of
goods. By 1000 BC China and India had a medical system based upon herbs. Early
uses were connected with magic, medicine, religion, tradition and
preservation[2].

A recent archaeological discovery suggests that the clove, indigenous to the
Indonesian island of Ternate in the Maluku Islands, could have been introduced
to the Middle East very early on. Digs found a clove burnt onto the floor of a
burned down kitchen in the Mesopotamian site of Terqa, in what is now modern-
day Syria, dated to 1700 BC [3].

In the story of Genesis, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers to spice
merchants. In the biblical poem Song of Solomon, the male speaker compares his
beloved to many forms of spices. Generally, Egyptian, Chinese, Indian and
Mesopotamian sources do not refer to known spices.

In South Asia, nutmeg, which originates from the Banda Islands in the
Moluccas, has a Sanskrit name. Sanskrit is the language of the sacred Hindu
texts, this shows how old the usage of this spice is in this region.
Historians estimate that nutmeg was introduced to Europe in the 6th century BC
[4].

The ancient Indian epic of Ramayana mentions cloves. In any case, it is known
that the Romans had cloves in the 1st century AD because Pliny the Elder spoke
of them in his writings.

Indonesian merchants went around China, India, the Middle East and the east
coast of Africa. Arab merchants facilitated the routes through the Middle East
and India. This made the city of Alexandria in Egypt the main trading centre
for spices because of its port. The most important discovery prior to the
European spice trade were the monsoon winds (40 AD). Sailing from Eastern
spice growers to Western European consumers gradually replaced the land-locked
spice routes once facilitated by the Middle East Arab caravans. [5]

### [edit] Middle Ages

Travels of Marco Polo.

Spices were among the most luxurious products available in Europe in the
Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper
alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They were all imported
from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive. From
the 8th until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice had the monopoly on
spice trade with the Middle East, and along with it the neighboring Italian
city-states. The trade made the region phenomenally rich. It has been
estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000 tons of the other common
spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the Late Middle
Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain
for 1.5 million people.[6] While pepper was the most common spice, the most
exclusive was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its
flavor. Spices that have now fallen into some obscurity include grains of
paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late
medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and
cubeb. A popular modern-day misconception is that medieval cooks used liberal
amounts of spices, particularly black pepper, merely to disguise the taste of
spoiled meat. However, a medieval feast was as much a culinary event as it was
a display of the host's vast resources and generosity, and as most nobles had
a wide selection of fresh or preserved meats, fish or seafood to choose from,
the use of ruinously expensive spices on cheap, rotting meat would have made
little sense.[7]

### [edit] Early modern period

The control of trade routes and the spice-producing regions were the main
reasons that Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama sailed to India in 1499. Spain
and Portugal were not happy to pay the high price that Venice demanded for
spices. At around the same time, Christopher Columbus returned from the New
World, he described to investors the many new, and then unknown, spices
available there.

It was Afonso de Albuquerque (1453â1515) who allowed the Portuguese to take
control of the sea routes to India. In 1506, he took the island of Socotra in
the mouth of the Red Sea and, in 1507, Ormuz in the Persian Gulf. Since
becoming the viceroy of the Indies, he took Goa in India in 1510, and Malacca
on the Malay peninsula in 1511. The Portuguese could now trade directly with
Siam, China and the Moluccas. The Silk Road complemented the Portuguese sea
routes, and brought the treasures of the Orient to Europe via Lisbon,
including many spices.

With the discovery of the New World came new spices, including allspice, bell
and chili peppers, vanilla and that greatest of flavorings, chocolate.
Although new settlers brought herbs to North America, before 1750 it was
thought that you could not grow plants or trees outside their native habitat.
This belief kept the spice trade, with America as a late comer with its new
seasonings, profitable well into the 19th century.

In the Caribbean, the island of Grenada is well known for growing and
exporting a number of spices including the nutmeg which was introduced to
Grenada by the settlers.
