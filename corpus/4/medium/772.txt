Istanbul (Turkish: Ä°stanbul; historically Byzantium and later Constantinople;
see the other names of Istanbul) is the largest city in Turkey, largest city
proper and second largest metropolitan area in Europe, and fourth largest city
proper in the world with a population of 12.6 million. Istanbul is the
cultural and financial center of Turkey. The city covers 27 districts of the
Istanbul province.[2] It is located on the Bosphorus Strait and encompasses
the natural harbor known as the Golden Horn, in the northwest of the country.
It extends both on the Europe (Thrace) and on the Asia (Anatolia) side of the
Bosphorus, and is thereby the only metropolis in the world that is situated on
two continents. In its long history, Istanbul served as the capital city of
the Roman Empire (330â395), the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire (395â1204
and 1261â1453), the Latin Empire (1204â1261), and the Ottoman Empire
(1453â1922). The city was chosen as joint European Capital of Culture for
2010. The historic areas of Istanbul were added to the UNESCO World Heritage
List in 1985.[3]

## [edit] Names

Further information: Names of Istanbul

The modern Turkish name Ä°stanbul (IPA: [isËtanbul] or colloquial
[É¨sËtanbul]) has been used to describe this city, in a range of different
variants, from as far back as the 10th century; it has been the common name
for the city in normal Turkish speech since before the conquest of 1453.
Etymologically, it derives from the Greek phrase "Îµá¼°Ï Ïá½´Î½ Î ÏÎ»Î¹Î½"
[istimËbolin] or in the Aegean dialect "Îµá¼°Ï Ïá½°Î½ Î ÏÎ»Î¹Î½"
[istamËbolin] (modern Greek "ÏÏÎ·Î½ Î ÏÎ»Î¹" [stimËboli]), which means
"in the city", "to the city" or "downtown".[4]

Byzantium is the first known name of the city. In 667 B.C., this Doric colony
was founded by settlers from the city-state of Megara, and they named the
colony after their king Byzas.[5] When Roman emperor Constantine I
(Constantine the Great) made the city the new eastern capital of the Roman
Empire on May 11, 330, he conferred on it the name Nova Roma ("New Rome").
Constantinople ("City of Constantine") was the name by which the city became
instead more widely known. It is first attested in official use under emperor
Theodosius II (408â450).[6] It remained the principal official name of the
city throughout the Byzantine period, and the most common name used for it in
the West until the early 20th century.

The city has also been nicknamed "The City on Seven Hills" because the
historic peninsula, the oldest part of the city, was built on seven hills
(just like Rome), each of which bears a historic mosque.[7] The hills are
represented in the city's emblem with seven triangles, above which rise four
minarets. Two of many other old nicknames of Istanbul are Vasilevousa Polis
(the Queen of Cities), which rose from the city's importance and wealth
throughout the Middle Ages; and Dersaadet, originally Der-i Saadet (the Door
to Happiness) which was first used towards the end of 19th century and is
still remembered today.

With the Turkish Postal Service Law of 28 March 1930, the Turkish authorities
officially requested foreigners to adopt Istanbul as the sole name also in
their own languages.[8]

## [edit] History

Main article: History of Istanbul

â If the Earth were a single state, Istanbul would be its capital. â  
âNapoleon Bonaparte[9]  
In 2008, during the construction works of the YenikapÄ± subway station and the
Marmaray tunnel at the historic peninsula on the European side, a previously
unknown Neolithic settlement dating from circa 6500 BC has been
discovered.[10][11][12] The first human settlement on the Anatolian side, the
Fikirtepe mound, is from the Copper Age period, with artifacts dating from
5500â3500 BC.[13] In nearby KadÄ±kÃ¶y (Chalcedon) a port settlement dating
back to the Phoenicians has been discovered. Cape Moda in Chalcedon was the
first location which the Greek settlers from Megara chose to colonize in 685
BC, prior to colonizing Byzantion on the European side of the Bosphorus under
the command of King Byzas in 667 BC. Byzantion was established on the site of
an ancient port settlement named Lygos, founded by Thracian tribes between the
13th and 11th centuries BC, along with the neighbouring Semistra,[14] of which
Plinius had mentioned in his historical accounts. Only a few walls and
substructures belonging to Lygos have survived to date, near the Seraglio
Point (Turkish: Sarayburnu), where the famous TopkapÄ± Palace now stands.
During the period of Byzantion, the Acropolis used to stand where the TopkapÄ±
Palace stands today.

After siding with Pescennius Niger against the victorious Roman emperor
Septimius Severus, the city was besieged by the Romans and suffered extensive
damage in 196 AD. Byzantium was rebuilt by Severus and quickly regained its
previous prosperity, being temporarily renamed as Augusta Antonina by the
emperor, in honor of his son.[15]

The location of Byzantium attracted Constantine I in 324 after a prophetic
dream was said to have identified the location of the city; but the true
reason behind this prophecy was probably Constantine's final victory over
Licinius at the Battle of Chrysopolis (ÃskÃ¼dar) on the Bosphorus, on 18
September, 324, which ended the civil war between the Roman Co-Emperors, and
brought an end to the final vestiges of the Tetrarchy system, during which
Nicomedia (present-day Ä°zmit, 100 km (62 mi) east of Istanbul) was the most
senior Roman capital city.[16] Byzantium (now renamed as Nova Roma which
eventually became Constantinopolis, i.e. "The City of Constantine") was
officially proclaimed the new capital of the Roman Empire six years later, in
330. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent partition of
the Roman Empire between his two sons, Constantinople became the capital of
the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. As well as being the centre of an
imperial dynasty, the unique position of Constantinople at the centre of two
continents made the city a magnet for international commerce, culture and
diplomacy. The Byzantine Empire was distinctly Greek in culture and became the
centre of Greek Orthodox Christianity, while its capital was adorned with many
magnificent churches, including the Hagia Sophia, once the world's largest
cathedral.[17] The seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople, spiritual leader
of the Eastern Orthodox Church, still remains in the Fener (Greek: Phanar)
district of Istanbul.[18]

In 1204, the Fourth Crusade was launched to capture Jerusalem, but had instead
turned on Constantinople, which was sacked and desecrated.[19] The city
subsequently became the centre of the Catholic Latin Empire, created by the
crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire, which was divided into a
number of splinter states, of which the Empire of Nicaea was to recapture
Constantinople in 1261 under the command of Michael VIII Palaeologus.

In the last decades of the Byzantine Empire, the city had decayed as the
Byzantine state became increasingly isolated and financially bankrupt, its
population had dwindled to some thirty or forty thousand people whilst large
sections remained uninhabited.[20] Due to the ever increasing inward turn the
Byzantines took, many facets of their surrounding empire were now falling
apart, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Ottoman Turks began a strategy by
which they took selected towns and smaller cities over time, enveloping Bursa
in 1326, Nicomedia in 1337, Gallipoli in 1354, and finally Adrianople in 1362.
This essentially cut off Constantinople from its main supply routes,
strangling it slowly.[21]

On 29 May 1453, Sultan Mehmed II "the Conqueror" captured Constantinople after
a 53-day siege (during which the last Roman/Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI,
died near the Porta Aurea while defending the city) and proclaimed that
Constantinople was now the new capital of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Mehmed's
first duty was to rejuvenate the city economically, creating the Grand Bazaar
and inviting the fleeing Orthodox and Catholic inhabitants to return. Captured
prisoners were freed to settle in the city whilst provincial governors in
Rumelia and Anatolia were ordered to send four thousand families to settle in
the city, whether Muslim, Christian or Jew, to form a unique cosmopolitan
society.[20] The Sultan also endowed the city with various architectural
monuments, including the TopkapÄ± Palace and the EyÃ¼p Sultan Mosque.
Religious foundations were established to fund the construction of grand
imperial mosques (such as the Fatih Mosque which was built on the spot where
the Church of the Holy Apostles once stood), adjoined by their associated
schools, hospitals and public baths. Suleiman the Magnificent's reign of the
Ottoman Empire from 1520 to 1566 was a period of great artistic and
architectural achievements. The famous architect Sinan designed many mosques
and other grand buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of ceramics,
calligraphy and miniature also flourished.

When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, the
capital was moved from Istanbul to Ankara. In the early years of the republic,
Istanbul was overlooked in favour of the new capital. However, starting from
the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as
new public squares (such as Taksim Square), boulevards and avenues were
constructed throughout the city; sometimes at the expense of the demolition of
many historical buildings. Starting from the 1970s, the population of Istanbul
began to rapidly increase, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city in
order to find employment in the many new factories that were constructed at
the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden sharp rise in the
city's population caused a large demand for housing development, and many
previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the greater
metropolitan area of Istanbul. Illegal construction, combined with corner-
cutting methods, have accounted for the reason why 65% of the buildings in
Istanbul are built without proper planning.[22] The concerns have increased
due to the serious nature of the Izmit earthquake of August 17, 1999.[23]

## [edit] Geography

Istanbul and the Bosporus today

### [edit] Location

Istanbul is located in the north-west Marmara Region of Turkey. It encloses
the southern Bosphorus which places the city on two continentsâthe western
portion of Istanbul is in Europe, while the eastern portion is in Asia. The
city boundaries cover a surface area of 1,830.92 square kilometres (707 sq
mi), while the metropolitan region, or the Province of Istanbul, covers 6,220
square kilometres (2,402 sq mi).

### [edit] Geology

Istanbul is situated near the North Anatolian fault line, which runs from
northern Anatolia to the Marmara Sea. Two tectonic plates, the African and the
Eurasian, push against each other here. This fault line has been responsible
for several deadly earthquakes in the region throughout history. In 1509 a
catastrophic earthquake caused a tsunami which broke over the sea-walls of the
city, destroying over 100 mosques and killing 10,000 people. In 1766 the EyÃ¼p
Sultan Mosque was largely destroyed. The 1894 earthquake caused the collapse
of many parts of the Grand Bazaar. A devastating earthquake on August 17,
1999, with its epicenter in nearby Izmit, left 18,000 dead and many more
homeless.[24] In all of these earthquakes, the devastating effects are a
result of the building density and poor construction of buildings.
Seismologists predict another earthquake, possibly measuring magnitude 7.0,
occurring before 2025.[25]

### [edit] Flora

Istanbul like the Marmara region it is situated in is characterized by a
temperate climate as well as a "transitional climate", midway between that of
the oceanic climate of the Black Sea, the humid continental climate of the
Balkan peninsula and the mediterranean climate of the southwest. This is also
reflected in its plant geography since flora of these three regions flourish
here. Istanbul is one of the provinces that best illustrates this aspect of
the Marmara region. Thanks to the constantly very humid climate of Istanbul,
plants of the Europe-Siberia region are concentrated here, especially in the
northern areas near the Black Sea coast. An increase in mediterranean flora is
observed in the warmer areas to the south of the city especially on the
Princes' Islands, the only place in Istanbul with a mediterranean vegetation.
With around 2500 different natural plant species, Istanbul alone puts European
countries such as the whole of the United Kingdom in the shade in this
respect. Even more importantly, this means that in Istanbul approximately one-
fourth of the more than ten thousand documented plants that grow naturally in
Turkey; some of these plants are endemic, in other words, they live only in
Istanbul and nowhere else in the whole world.[26]

<IMG>

<IMG>

Snow is common in winter

### [edit] Climate

Istanbul has a temperate climate, though a plausible argument can be made that
under the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, Istanbul has a humid subtropical
climate.

In summer the weather in Istanbul is hot and humid, the temperature between
June and September averaging 28Â°C (82Â°F). During winter it is cold, wet and
often snowy, averaging 5Â°C (42Â°F). Average annual precipitation is 693 mm
(27.2 inches). Summer is by far the driest season, although there is no real
summer drought as rain does occur all year round, and so the climate cannot be
considered mediterranean. Snowfall is quite common between the months of
December and March, snowing for a week or two, but it can be heavy once it
snows. The city is also quite windy, having an average wind speed of 17 km/h
(11 mph).[27]

## [edit] City arrangement

Istanbul's districts are divided into three main areas:

<IMG>

<IMG>

Three historic quarters of Istanbul, looking south from BeyoÄlu to the
"historic peninsula" separated by the Golden Horn to the farther right and
KadÄ±kÃ¶y on the Asian side separated by the entrance of the Bosphorus to the
left.

  * The historic peninsula of old Istanbul corresponds approximately to the extent of Constantinople in the 15th century; it comprises the districts of EminÃ¶nÃ¼ and Fatih. This area lies on the southern shores of the Golden Horn, which separates the old city center from the northern and younger parts of the European side. The historic peninsula ends with the Theodosian Land Walls in the west. The peninsula is surrounded by the Sea of Marmara on the south and the entrance of the Bosphorus on the east.
  * North of the Golden Horn are the historical BeyoÄlu and BeÅiktaÅ districts, where the last Sultan's palace is located, followed by a chain of former villages such as OrtakÃ¶y and Bebek along the shores of the Bosphorus. On both the European and Asian sides of the Bosphorus, wealthy Istanbulites built luxurious chalet mansions, called yalÄ±, which were used as summer residences.
  * The districts of ÃskÃ¼dar (ancient Chrysopolis) and KadÄ±kÃ¶y (ancient Chalcedon) which are located on the Asian side were originally separate cities (like the district of BeyoÄlu (medieval Pera) on the European side also used to be.) These cities have eventually been absorbed by Istanbul and have become its districts. Today, the Asian side of the city has numerous modern residential areas and business districts, and is home to around one-third of Istanbul's population.

To the west, to the east and to the north, Istanbul extends far beyond its
historical quarters. The tallest office and residential towers rise
particularly in the quarters of Levent, Etiler and Maslak on the European
side, and in the quarter of KozyataÄÄ± on the Asian side. Due to Istanbul's
exponential growth during the second half of the 20th century, a significant
portion of the city consists of gecekondus, a Turkish word created in the
1940s meaning "built overnight" and refers to the illegally constructed
squatter buildings that comprise entire neighborhoods and run rampant in the
outskirts of Turkeyâs largest cities; especially Istanbul, Ankara, Ä°zmir,
and Bursa. According to the official definition stated in the Gecekondus Act
of 1966, these neighborhoods are typically built on abandoned land or on lands
owned by others, without the permission of the landowner or the Municipality,
and the construction methods do not follow the official rules and regulations.

### [edit] Districts

Istanbul Province has 32 districts, of which 27 form the city proper of
Istanbul, also called Greater Istanbul, administered by the Istanbul
Metropolitan Municipality (or Municipality of Metropolitan Istanbul) (Turkish:
Ä°stanbul BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅehir Belediyesi).

The mayor of Istanbul, currently Kadir TopbaÅ, serves as the prefect of the
city.[29] The governor of Istanbul province is Muammer GÃ¼ler.[30] Istanbul is
a home rule city and municipal elections are mainly partisan. The metropolitan
model of governance has been used with the establishment of metropolitan
administration in 1930. The metropolitan council is responsible for all
authority when it comes to making city decisions.[31] The metropolitan
government structure consists of three main organs: (1) The Metropolitan Mayor
(elected every five years), (2) The Metropolitan Council (decision making body
with the mayor, district Mayors, and one fifth of the district municipal
councilors), (3) The metropolitan executive committee. There are three types
of local authorities: (1) municipalities, (2) special provincial
administrations, (3) village administrations. Among the local authorities,
municipalities are gaining greater importance with the rise in urbanization.

The changing population of Istanbul

The population of the metropolis more than tripled during the 25 years between
1980 and 2005. Roughly 70% of all Istanbulites live in the European section
and around 30% in the Asian section. Due to high unemployment in the southeast
of Turkey, many people from that region migrated to Istanbul, where they
established themselves in the outskirts of the city. Migrants, predominantly
from eastern Anatolia arrive in Istanbul expecting improved living conditions
and employment, which usually end with little success. This results each year
with new gecekondus at the outskirts of the city, which are later developed
into neighbourhoods and integrated into the greater metropolis.

The city has a population of 11,372,613 residents according to the latest
count as of 2007,[1] and is one of the largest cities in the world today. The
rate of population growth in the city is currently at 3.45% a year on average,
mainly due to the influx of people from the surrounding rural areas.
Istanbul's population density of 2,742 people per square mile (1,700 per
square km) far exceeds Turkey's 130 people per square mile (81 people per
square km).[32]

The following overview shows the numbers of inhabitants by year. Population
tallies up to 1914 are estimated with variations of up to 50% depending upon
researcher. The numbers from 1927 to 2000 are results of censuses. The numbers
of 2005 and 2006 are based on computer simulation forecasts. The doubling of
the population of Istanbul between 1980 and 1985 is due to a natural increase
in population as well as the expansion of municipal limits.

#### [edit] Overview

<IMG>

<IMG>

View of the Ottoman Neo-Baroque style OrtakÃ¶y Mosque

The urban landscape of Istanbul is shaped by many communities. The religion
with the largest community of followers is Islam. Religious minorities include
Greek Orthodox Christians, Armenian Christians, Catholic Levantines and
Sephardic Jews. According to the 2000 census, there were 2691 active mosques,
123 active churches and 26 active synagogues in Istanbul; as well as 109
Muslim cemeteries and 57 non-Muslim cemeteries. Some districts have sizeable
populations of these ethnic groups, such as the KumkapÄ± district which has a
sizeable Armenian population, the Balat district which has a sizeable Jewish
population, the Fener district which has a sizeable Greek population, and some
neighbourhoods in the NiÅantaÅÄ± and BeyoÄlu districts which have sizeable
Levantine populations. In some quarters, such as Kuzguncuk, an Armenian church
sits next to a synagogue, and on the other side of the road a Greek Orthodox
church is found beside a mosque.

The seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople, spiritual leader of the Greek
Orthodox Church is located in the Fener (Phanar) district. Also based in
Istanbul are the archbishop of the Turkish-Orthodox community, an Armenian
archbishop, and the Turkish Grand-Rabbi. A number of places reflect past
movements of different communities into Istanbul, most notably ArnavutkÃ¶y
(Albanian village), PolonezkÃ¶y (Polish village) and Yenibosna (New Bosnia).

#### [edit] Muslims

<IMG>

<IMG>

The Sultan Ahmed Mosque

The Muslims are the largest religious group in Istanbul. Among them, the
Sunnis form the most populous sect, while a number of the local Muslims are
Alevis. In 2007 there were 2,944 active mosques in Istanbul.[34]

Istanbul was the final seat of the Islamic Caliphate, between 1517 and 1924,
when the Caliphate was dissolved and its powers were handed over to the
Turkish Parliament. On September 2, 1925, the tekkes and tarikats were banned,
as their activities were deemed incompatible with the characteristics of the
secular democratic Republic of Turkey; particularly with the secular education
system and the laicist state's control over religious affairs through the
Religious Affairs Directorate. Most followers of Sufism and other forms of
Islamic mysticism practiced clandestinely afterwards, and some of these sects
still boast numerous followers. In order to avoid the still valid prohibition,
these organisations represent themselves as "cultural associations."

#### [edit] Christians

<IMG>

<IMG>

Inside the Church of St. George in the Fener (Phanar) quarter of Istanbul

The city has been the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate since the 4th
century AD, and continues to serve as the seat of some other Orthodox
churches, such as the Turkish Orthodox Church and the Armenian Patriarchate.
The city was formerly also the seat of the Bulgarian Exarchate, before its
autocephaly was recognized by other Orthodox churches.

The everyday life of the Christians, particularly the Greeks and Armenians
living in Istanbul changed significantly following the bitter conflicts
between these ethnic groups and the Turks during the fall of the Ottoman
Empire, which began in the 1820s and continued for a century. The conflicts
reached their culmination in the decade between 1912 and 1922; during the
Balkan Wars, the First World War and the Turkish War of Independence. The
city's Greek Orthodox community was exempted from the population exchange
between Greece and Turkey in 1923. However, a series of special restrictions
and taxes during the years of the Second World War (see, e.g., VarlÄ±k
Vergisi), and the Istanbul Pogrom of 1955 which caused the deaths of 15 Greeks
and the injury of 32 others, greatly increased emigration from Istanbul to
Greece. In 1964, all Greeks without Turkish citizenship residing in Turkey
(around 12,000)[35] were deported. Today, most of Turkey's remaining Greek and
Armenian minorities live in or near Istanbul. The number of the local Turkish
Armenians in Istanbul today amount to approximately 45,000[36] (not including
the nearly 40,000 Armenian workers in Turkey who came from Armenia after 1991
and mostly live and work in Istanbul);[37] while the Greek community, which
amounted to 150,000 citizens in 1924,[38] currently amounts to approximately
4,000 citizens.[36] There are also 60,000 Istanbulite Greeks who currently
live in Greece but continue to retain their Turkish citizenship.[36] Beside
the mostly Catholic Levantines, who are the descendants of European (Genoese,
Venetian and French) traders who established trading outposts during the
Byzantine and Ottoman periods, there is also a small, scattered number of
Bosphorus Germans living in Istanbul.

#### [edit] Jews

<IMG>

<IMG>

Ashkenazi Synagogue

The Sephardic Jews have lived in the city for over 500 years, see the history
of the Jews in Turkey. They fled the Iberian Peninsula during the Spanish
Inquisition of 1492, when they were forced to convert to Christianity after
the fall of the Moorish Kingdom of Andalucia. The Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II
(1481-1512) sent a sizable fleet to Spain under the command of Kemal Reis in
order to save the Sephardic Jews. More than 200,000 fled first to Tangier,
Algiers, Genova and Marseille, later to Salonica and finally to Istanbul. The
Sultan granted over 93,000 of these Spanish Jews to take refuge in the Ottoman
Empire. Another large group of Sephardic Jews came from southern Italy which
was under Spanish control. The Ä°talyan Sinagogu (Italian Synagogue) in Galata
is mostly frequented by the descendants of these Italian Jews in Istanbul,
where more than 20,000 Sephardic Jews still remain today. Altogether 20 active
synagogues are to be found in the city, the most important of them being the
Neve Shalom Synagogue inaugurated in 1951, in the BeyoÄlu quarter. The
Turkish Grand Rabbi in Istanbul (currently Ishak Haleva) presides over
community affairs. The Sephardic Jews of Iberia and Italy contributed much to
the rising power of the Ottoman Empire by introducing new ideas, methods and
craftsmanship. The first Gutenberg press in Istanbul was established by the
Sephardic Jews in 1493, who excelled in many areas, particularly medicine,
trade and banking. There is also a relatively smaller and more recent
community of Ashkenazi Jews in Istanbul who continue to live in the city since
the 19th century. A second large wave of Ashkenazi Jews came to Istanbul
during the 1930s and 1940s following the rise of Nazism in Germany which
persecuted the Ashkenazi Jews of central and eastern Europe.

## [edit] Economy

Main article: Economy of Istanbul

<IMG>

<IMG>

Levent financial district

Istanbul has always been the center of the country's economic life because of
its location as an international junction of land and sea trade routes. The
opening of specific markets in the city during the 1980s further strengthened
the city's economic status. Inaugurated at the beginning of 1986, the Istanbul
Stock Exchange (ISE) is the sole securities market of Turkey.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata was the financial center of the
Ottoman Empire

Today, the city generates 55% of Turkey's trade and 45% of the country's
wholesale trade, and generates 21.2% of Turkey's gross national product.
Istanbul contributes 40% of all taxes collected in Turkey and produces 27.5%
of Turkey's national product. In 2005 the City of Istanbul had a GDP of $133
billion.[39] In 2005 companies based in Istanbul made exports worth
$41,397,000,000 and imports worth $69,883,000,000; which corresponded to 56.6%
and 60.2% of Turkey's exports and imports, respectively, in that year.[40]

According to Forbes magazine, Istanbul had a total of 35 billionaires as of
March 2008 (up from 25 in 2007), ranking 4th in the world behind Moscow (74
billionaires), New York City (71 billionaires) and London (36
billionaires).[41]

Istanbul is also Turkey's largest industrial center. It employs approximately
20% of Turkey's industrial labor and contributes 38% of Turkey's industrial
workspace. Istanbul and its surrounding province produce cotton, fruit, olive
oil, silk, and tobacco. Food processing, textile production, oil products,
rubber, metal ware, leather, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, glass,
machinery, automotive, transport vehicles, paper and paper products, and
alcoholic drinks are among the city's major industrial products.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Maslak financial district

Istanbul is one of the most important tourism spots of Turkey. There are
thousands of hotels and other tourist oriented industries in the city,
catering to both vacationers and visiting professionals. In 2006 a total of
23,148,669 tourists visited Turkey, most of whom entered the country through
the airports and seaports of Istanbul and Antalya.[42] The total number of
tourists who entered Turkey through AtatÃ¼rk International Airport and Sabiha
GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport in Istanbul reached 5,346,658, rising from
4,849,353 in 2005.[43] Istanbul is also one of the world's major conference
destinations and is an increasingly popular choice for the world's leading
international associations.[44]

## [edit] Infrastructure

### [edit] Health and medicine

See also: List of hospitals in Istanbul

The city has many public and private hospitals, clinics and laboratories
within its bounds and numerous medical research centers. Many of these
facilities have high technology equipment, which has contributed to the recent
upsurge in "medical tourism" to Istanbul,[45] particularly from West European
countries like the United Kingdom and Germany where governments send patients
with lower income to the city for the relatively inexpensive service of high-
tech medical treatment and operations.[46] Istanbul has particularly become a
global destination for laser eye surgery and plastic surgery.[45] The city
also has an Army Veterans Hospital in the military medical center.

Pollution-related health problems increase especially in the winter, when the
combustion of heating fuels increase. The rising number of new cars in the
city and the slow development of public transportation often cause urban smog
conditions. Mandatory use of unleaded gas was scheduled to begin only in
January 2006.[47]

### [edit] Utilities

Main article: Utilities in Istanbul

<IMG>

<IMG>

Valens Aqueduct

The first water supply systems which were built in Istanbul date back to the
foundation of the city. Two of the greatest aqueducts built in the Roman
period are the Mazulkemer Aqueduct and the Valens Aqueduct. These aqueducts
were built in order to channel water from the HalkalÄ± area in the western
edge of the city to the BeyazÄ±t district in the city center, which was known
as the Forum Tauri in the Roman period.[48] After reaching the city center,
the water was later collected in the city's numerous cisterns, such as the
famous Philoxenos (Binbirdirek) Cistern and the Basilica (Yerebatan) Cistern.
Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent commissioned Sinan, his engineer and
architect-in-chief, to improve the water needs of the city. Sinan constructed
the KÄ±rkÃ§eÅme Water Supply System in 1555.[48] In later years, with the aim
of responding to the ever-increasing public demand, water from various springs
was channeled to the public fountains by means of small supply lines; see
German Fountain.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Basilica Cistern

Today, Istanbul has a chlorinated and filtered water supply and a sewage
disposal system managed by the government agency Ä°SKÄ°.[49] There are also
several private sector organizations distributing clean water. Electricity
distribution services are covered by the state-owned TEK. The first
electricity production plant in the city, SilahtaraÄa Termik Santrali, was
established in 1914 and continued to supply electricity until 1983.[50]

The Ottoman Ministry of Post and Telegraph was established in the city on 23
October 1840.[51] The first post office was the Postahane-i Amire near the
courtyard of Yeni Mosque.[51] In 1876 the first international mailing network
between Istanbul and the lands beyond the vast Ottoman Empire was
established.[51] In 1901 the first money transfers were made through the post
offices and the first cargo services became operational.[51] Samuel Morse
received his first ever patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old
Beylerbeyi Palace (the present Beylerbeyi Palace was built in 1861â1865 on
the same location) in Istanbul, which was issued by Sultan AbdÃ¼lmecid who
personally tested the new invention.[52] Following this successful test,
installation works of the first telegraph line between Istanbul and Edirne
began on 9 August 1847.[53] In 1855 the Telegraph Administration was
established.[51] In July 1881 the first telephone circuit in Istanbul was
established between the Ministry of Post and Telegraph in SoÄukÃ§eÅme and
the Postahane-i Amire in Yenicami.[53] On 23 May 1909, the first manual
telephone exchange with a 50 line capacity was established in the BÃ¼yÃ¼k
Postane (Grand Post Office) of Sirkeci.[53]

## [edit] Transportation

### [edit] Airports

<IMG>

<IMG>

AtatÃ¼rk International Airport

Istanbul has two international airports: The larger one is the AtatÃ¼rk
International Airport located in the YeÅilkÃ¶y district on the European side,
about 24 kilometres (15 mi) west from the city center. When it was first
built, the airport used to be at the western edge of the metropolitan area but
now lies within the city bounds.

The smaller one is the Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport located in the
KurtkÃ¶y district on the Asian side, close to the Istanbul Park GP Racing
Circuit. It is situated approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of the Asian
side and 45 kilometres (28 mi) east of the European city center.

### [edit] Motorways

<IMG>

districts

The E80 and Trans European Motorway (TEM) are the three main motorway
connections between Europe and Turkey. The motorway network around Istanbul is
well developed and is constantly being extended. Motorways lead east to Ankara
and west to Edirne.

There are also two express highways circling the city. The older one, the O1,
is mostly used for inner city traffic; while the more recent one, the TEM
highway, is mostly used by intercity or intercontinental traffic. The
Bosphorus Bridge on O1 and the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge on TEM establish the
motorway connection between the European and the Asian sides of the Bosphorus.

BÃ¼yÃ¼kdere Avenue is the main artery that runs through the central business
districts of Levent and Maslak on the European side, and is also accessible
through a number of subway stations.

### [edit] Navigation

Sea transport is vital for Istanbul, as the city is practically surrounded by
sea on all sides: the Sea of Marmara, the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus and the
Black Sea. Many Istanbulites live on the Asian side of the city but work on
the European side (or vice-versa) and the city's famous commuter ferries form
the backbone of the daily transition between the two parts of the city - even
more so than the two suspension bridges which span the Bosphorus. The commuter
ferries, along with the high speed catamaran Seabus (Deniz OtobÃ¼sÃ¼), also
form the main connection between the city and the Princes' Islands.

<IMG>

<IMG>

A cruise ship (left) and Seabus (right)

Ä°DO (Ä°stanbul Deniz OtobÃ¼sleri \- Istanbul Sea Buses) was established in
1987 and operates the high speed catamaran Seabus which run between the
European and Asian parts of Istanbul, also connecting the city with the
Princes' Islands and other destinations in the Sea of Marmara. The YenikapÄ±
High Speed Car Ferry Port on the European side, and the Pendik High Speed Car
Ferry Port on the Asian side, are where the high speed catamaran "car ferries"
are based. The car ferries which operate between YenikapÄ± (on the European
side of Istanbul) and BandÄ±rma reduce the driving time between Istanbul and
Ä°zmir and other major destinations on Turkey's Aegean coast by several hours;
while those which operate between YenikapÄ± or Pendik (on the Asian side of
Istanbul) and Yalova significantly reduce the driving time between Istanbul
and Bursa or Antalya.

<IMG>

<IMG>

The port of Istanbul is the most important one in the country. The old port on
the Golden Horn serves primarily for personal navigation, while KarakÃ¶y port
in Galata is used by the large cruise liners. Regular services as well as
cruises from both KarakÃ¶y and EminÃ¶nÃ¼ exist to several port cities in the
Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Istanbul's main cargo port is located in the
Harem district on the Asian side of the city.

Istanbul also has several marinas of varying size for personal navigation, the
largest of which are the AtakÃ¶y Marina on the European side and KalamÄ±Å
Marina on the Asian side.

### [edit] Railway

<IMG>

<IMG>

Sirkeci Terminal was opened in 1890 as the terminus of the Orient Express

In 1883, a Belgian entrepreneur, Georges Nagelmackers, began rail service
between Paris and Constantinople, using a steamship to ferry passengers from
Varna to Constantinople. In 1889, a rail line was completed going through
Bucharest to Constantinople, making the whole journey via land possible. The
route was known as the Orient Express, made even more famous by the works of
Agatha Christie and Graham Greene.[54]

<IMG>

<IMG>

HaydarpaÅa Terminal was opened in 1908 as the terminus of the Istanbul-
Baghdad and Istanbul-Medina railways

Today, the Sirkeci Terminal of the Turkish State Railways (TCDD), which was
originally opened as the terminus of the Orient Express, is the terminus of
all the lines on the European side and the main connection node of the Turkish
railway network with the rest of Europe. Currently, international connections
are provided by the line running between Istanbul and Thessaloniki, Greece,
and the Bosphorus Express serving daily between Sirkeci and Bucharest,
Romania. Lines to Sofia, Belgrade, Budapest, and ChiÅinÄu are established
over the Bosphorus Express connection to Bucharest. .

Beyond the Bosphorus, the HaydarpaÅa Terminal on the Asian side serves lines
running several times daily to Ankara, and less frequently to other
destinations in Anatolia. The railway networks on the European and Asian sides
are currently connected by the train ferry across the Bosphorus, which will be
replaced by an underwater tunnel connection with the completion of the
Marmaray project, scheduled for 2012. Marmaray (Bosphorus Rail Tunnel) will
also connect the metro lines on the European and Asian parts of the city.
HaydarpaÅa Terminal was originally opened as the terminus of the Istanbul-
Baghdad and Istanbul-Damascus-Medina railways.

Historic tram on Ä°stiklal Avenue

By the end of 1990, a historic tram was put in service along Ä°stiklal Avenue
between Taksim and TÃ¼nel, which is a single 1.6 km-long line.

On 1 November 2003, another nostalgic tram line (T3) was reopened on the
Anatolian part of Istanbul between KadÄ±kÃ¶y and Moda. It has 10 stations on a
2.6 km long route. The trip takes 21 minutes.

##### [edit] Modern trams

###### [edit] Line T1

A fast tram (T1) was put in service in 1992 on standard gauge track with
modern cars, connecting Sirkeci with TopkapÄ±. The line was extended on one
end from TopkapÄ± to Zeytinburnu in March 1994, and on the other end from
Sirkeci to EminÃ¶nÃ¼ in April 1996. On 30 January 2005 it was extended from
EminÃ¶nÃ¼ to FÄ±ndÄ±klÄ±, crossing the Golden Horn through the Galata Bridge
for the first time after 44 years. A final extension to KabataÅ was opened in
June 2006.

<IMG>

<IMG>

A modern tram running in the old quarter of Istanbul

The line has 24 stations on a length of 14 km. Service was initially operated
with 22 LRT vehicles built by ABB, now reassigned to other lines; while
stations were provided with temporary high platforms. These vehicles were
replaced by 55 low-floor Bombardier Flexity Swift trams in 2003. An entire
trip takes 42 minutes. The daily transport capacity is 155,000 passengers. The
amount of investment totaled US$110 million.

###### [edit] Line T2

In September 2006, a second tram line (T2) was added, running west from
Zeytinburnu to BaÄcÄ±lar. Service on this line is operated with 14 ABB LRT
cars. Stations have high platforms at the level of the car floor.

The modern funicular line running between KabataÅ and Taksim

Istanbul is served by two underground funicular railways, of very different
ages and styles.

The older of these lines is the TÃ¼nel (1875), which is the oldest
subterranean railway line in continental Europe, and the second oldest line in
the world after the Underground (1863) in London (arguably third in the world,
if one counts Brooklyn, New York's abandoned Atlantic Avenue Tunnel). The
TÃ¼nel is 573 m long with an altitude difference of 60 m and no intermediate
stations between KarakÃ¶y and TÃ¼nel Square. It has been continuously in
service since 1875. Two trains run on a single rail every 3.5 minutes, and a
trip takes 1.5 minutes. 15,000 people are transported daily.

A second funicular line, the KabataÅ-Taksim Funicular, opened in June 2006,
connecting KabataÅ and Taksim. This system connects the Seabus station and
the tram stop in KabataÅ to the metro station at Taksim Square. It is about
600 meters long and climbs approximately 60 meters in 110 seconds.

##### [edit] Light rail

Main article: Istanbul LRT

The Istanbul LRT is a light rail transit system consisting of 2 lines. The
first line (M1) began service on 3 September 1989 between Aksaray and
Kartaltepe. The line was further developed step-by-step and reached AtatÃ¼rk
Airport on December 20, 2002. The other line (T4) was opened in 2007 between
EdirnekapÄ± and Mescid-i Selam. There are 36 stations, including 12
underground and 3 viaduct stations, on the line's 32 km length. The lines are
totally segregated from other traffic without level crossings and run
underground for 10.2 km. Service is operated with LRT vehicles built by ABB in
1989.

##### [edit] Metro

Main article: Istanbul Metro

<IMG>

<IMG>

A subway station in Istanbul

The construction of the modern underground railway network of Istanbul began
in 1992. The first line (M2) between Taksim and 4th Levent went into service
on 16 September 2000. This line is 8.5 km long and has 6 stations, which all
look similar but are in different colors. Currently there are 8 French built
4-car trains in service, which run every 5 minutes on average and transport
130,000 passengers daily. A trip along the entire line takes 12 minutes. The
entire subway line was built by the cut-and-cover method to withstand an
earthquake of up to 9.0 on the Richter magnitude scale.

A northern extension from 4th Levent to AyazaÄa (Maslak) was opened in
January 2009. The southern section of the metro from Taksim to YenikapÄ±,
across the Golden Horn on a bridge and underground through the old city, has
thus far been completed up to the ÅiÅhane stop and is expected to become
fully operational in 2009. It will be 5.4 km long, with four stations. At
YenikapÄ± it will intersect with the extended light metro and the suburban
train lines.

On the Asian side, construction of the line from KadÄ±kÃ¶y to Kartal
continues. The Marmaray tunnel (Bosporus undersea railway tunnel) will connect
the metro lines of the Asian and European parts of the city. According to the
scheduled construction timeline, the tunnel will enter service in 2012.

##### [edit] Suburban trains

A railway line runs between the main train station of the European part, the
Sirkeci Terminal, and the HalkalÄ± district towards the west of the city
center, with 18 stations along its 30 km length. A single trip takes 48
minutes. Another suburban line runs on the Anatolian part from the main train
station, the HaydarpaÅa Terminal, to Gebze at the eastern end of the city.
The 44 km long line has 28 stations and the trip takes 65 minutes. Electrified
trains transport 13,000 passengers hourly on each line.

## [edit] Architecture

Main article: Architecture of Istanbul

Throughout its long history, Istanbul has acquired a reputation for being a
cultural and ethnic melting pot. As a result, there are many historical
mosques, churches, synagogues, palaces, castles and towers to visit in the
city. Some of these historical structures, which draw millions to the city
every year, reflect the heart and soul of Istanbul.[55]

### [edit] Ancient Greek

Maiden's (Leander's) Tower

The famous Maiden's (Leander's) Tower, one of the symbols of Istanbul, was
originally built by the ancient Athenian general Alcibiades in 408 BC to
control the movements of the Persian ships in the Bosphorus strait.[56]

### [edit] Roman

<IMG>

<IMG>

Hippodrome of Constantinople

The most important monuments of Roman architecture in the city include the
Column of Constantine (Turkish: ÃemberlitaÅ), which was erected in 330 by
Constantine the Great for marking the declaration of the new capital city of
the Roman Empire[57] . The Mazulkemer Aqueduct, the Valens Aqueduct, the
Column of the Goths at the Seraglio Point, the Milion which served for
calculating the distances between Constantinople and other cities of the Roman
Empire, and the Hippodrome of Constantinople which was built following the
model of the Circus Maximus in Rome are other Roman era structures in the
city. Construction of the Walls of Constantinople began under Constantine the
Great,[58] who enlarged the previously existing walls of Byzantium in order to
defend the new Roman capital city which quickly grew following its
proclamation as Nova Roma. A new set of walls was built further west during
the reign of Theodosius II, and rebuilt after an earthquake in 447 in their
current shape.

The Hagia Sophia: Originally a church, later a mosque, now a museum, was the
largest ever cathedral building in the world for a thousand years, until the
completion of the Seville Cathedral in Spain

The early Byzantine architecture followed the classical Roman model of domes
and arches, but further improved these architectural concepts, as evidenced
with the Hagia Sophia, which is the largest structure on Sultanahmet Square in
the EminÃ¶nÃ¼ district. The Hagia Sophia was designed by Isidorus and
Anthemius as the third church to rise on this location, between 532 and 537,
following the Nika riots (532) during which the second church was destroyed
(the first church, known as the Megala Ekklessia ("Great Church") was
inaugurated by Constantius II in 360; the second church was inaugurated by
Theodosius II in 405, while the third and current one was inaugurated by
Justinian in 537). The Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (commonly known as
the Little Hagia Sophia), which was the first church built by Justinian in
Constantinople and edificed between 527 and 536, had earlier signaled such an
improvement in the design of domed buildings, which require complex solutions
for carrying the structure. The present-day Hagia Irene (which was originally
built by Constantine in the 4th century, but was later enlarged by Justinian
in the 6th century) and the Basilica Cistern are also from this period.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Galata Tower

The most important churches which were built after the Byzantines recovered
Constantinople from the Latin Crusaders in 1261 include the Pammakaristos
Church and Chora Church. Also in this period, the Genoese PodestÃ  of Galata,
Montano de Marinis, built the Palazzo del Comune (1316),[59] an identical copy
of the San Giorgio Palace in Genoa, which still stands in ruins on a parallel
side street to the north of Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata,
together with its adjacent buildings and numerous Genoese houses from the
early 1300s. The Genoese also built the Galata Tower, which they named as
Christea Turris (Tower of Christ), at the highest point of the citadel of
Galata, in 1348.

Rumeli Castle

### [edit] Ottoman

See also: Ottoman architecture

The Ottoman Turks built the AnadoluhisarÄ± on the Asian side of the Bosphorus
in 1394, and the RumelihisarÄ± at the opposite (European) shore, in 1452, a
year before the conquest of Constantinople. The main purpose of these castles,
armed with the long range Balyemez (Faule Metze) cannons, was to block the sea
traffic of the Bosphorus and prevent the support ships from the Genoese
colonies on the Black Sea ports, such as Caffa, Sinop, and Amasra, from
reaching Constantinople and helping the Byzantines during the Turkish siege of
the city.[60] The first mosque on the European side of Istanbul was built
inside the Rumeli Castle in 1452.

TopkapÄ± Palace

Following the Ottoman conquest of the city, Sultan Mehmed II initiated a wide
scale reconstruction plan, which included the construction of grand buildings
such as the TopkapÄ± Palace, Grand Bazaar and the Yedikule (Seven Towers)
Castle which guarded the main entrance gate of the city, the Porta Aurea
(Golden Gate). The first grand mosque which was built in the city proper was
the EyÃ¼p Sultan Mosque in around 1459. The mosque was built on the site of
the grave of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad who had
died outside the land walls of Constantinople (walls of Theodosius II) in
669,[61] during the early skirmishes which preluded the Arab siege (674-678)
to take the city. The first imperial mosque inside the city walls was the
Fatih Mosque (1470) which was built on the site of the Church of the Holy
Apostles, an important Byzantine church originally edificed in the time of
Constantine the Great. Many other imperial mosques were built in the following
centuries, such as the famous SÃ¼leymaniye Mosque (1557) which was ordered by
Suleiman the Magnificent and designed by the great Ottoman architect Sinan,
and the famous Sultan Ahmet Mosque (1616) which is also known as the Blue
Mosque for the blue tiles that adorn its interior. In the centuries following
Mehmed II, many new important buildings, such as the SÃ¼leymaniye Mosque,
Sultanahmet Mosque, Yeni Mosque and numerous others were constructed.

GÃ¼mÃ¼Åsu Palas[62] (1900) is an Art Nouveau (Liberty) style building in the
GÃ¼mÃ¼Åsuyu neighbourhood

In the 18th and 19th centuries, traditional Ottoman architectural styles were
gradually replaced by European styles, such as the Baroque style interiors of
the AynalÄ±kavak Palace (1677â1679) and Nuruosmaniye Mosque (1748â1755,
the first Baroque style mosque in the city, also famous for its Baroque
fountain), and the 18th century Baroque additions to the Harem section of the
TopkapÄ± Palace. Following the Tanzimat reforms which effectively started
Turkey's Europeanization process in 1839, new palaces and mosques were built
in Neoclassical, Baroque and Rococo styles, or a mixture of all three, such as
the DolmabahÃ§e Palace, Beylerbeyi Palace and OrtakÃ¶y (Mecidiye) Mosque[63].

Starting from the early 19th century, the areas around Ä°stiklal Avenue were
filled with grandiose embassy buildings belonging to prominent European
states, and rows of European (mostly Neoclassical and later Art Nouveau) style
buildings started to appear on both flanks of the avenue. Istanbul especially
became a major center of the Art Nouveau (Liberty) movement in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries, with famous architects of this style like Raimondo
D'Aronco building many palaces and mansions in the city proper and on the
Princes' Islands. His most important works in the city include several
buildings of the YÄ±ldÄ±z Palace complex, and the Botter House on Ä°stiklal
Avenue. The famous Camondo Stairs on Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in
KarakÃ¶y (Galata) is also a beautiful example of Art Nouveau architecture.
Other important examples are the HÄ±div KasrÄ±[64] (Khedive Palace) on the
Asian side of the Bosphorus, Flora Han in Sirkeci, and Frej ApartmanÄ±[65] in
the ÅiÅhane quarter of BeyoÄlu.[66]

Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge

The urban landscape is constantly changing. In the Greek, Roman and Byzantine
periods, the city was largely made up of the historic peninsula of
Constantinople, with the citadel of Galata (also called Sykae or Pera,
present-day BeyoÄlu) at north, and Chrysopolis (ÃskÃ¼dar) and Chalcedon
(KadÄ±kÃ¶y) at east, across the Bosphorus. These were all independent cities
back then. The present City of Istanbul can be considered the metropolitan
area of old Constantinople, encompassing every single settlement around the
original city, and expanding even further with the establishment of new
neighbourhoods and districts since the 19th century.

Until the early 19th century, the city walls of Galata, the medieval Genoese
citadel, used to stand. These Genoese fortifications, of which only the Galata
Tower stands today, were demolished in the early 1800s to give way for a
northwards expansion of the city, towards the neighbourhoods of BeÅiktaÅ,
ÅiÅli, NiÅantaÅÄ±, and beyond.

In the last decades, numerous tall structures were built around the city to
accommodate a rapid growth in population. Surrounding towns were absorbed into
Istanbul as the city rapidly expanded outwards. The tallest highrise office
and residential buildings are mostly located in the northern areas of the
European side, and especially in the business and shopping districts of
Levent, Maslak, and Etiler which are situated between the Bosphorus Bridge and
Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge. Levent and Etiler also have numerous upmarket
shopping malls, like Kanyon, Metrocity, Akmerkez, Mayadrom and Mayadrom
Uptown. The headquarters of Turkey's largest companies and banks are also
located in this area.

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, the Asian side of Istanbul,
which was originally a tranquil place full of seaside summer residences and
elegant chalet mansions surrounded by lush and vast umbrella pine gardens,
experienced a massive urban growth. The construction of the long, wide and
elegant BaÄdat Avenue, with its rows of upscale shops and restaurants,
contributed much to the initial expansion in the area. The fact that these
areas were largely empty until the 1960s also provided the chance for
developing better infrastructure and a tidier urban planning when compared
with most other residential areas in the city. But the real expansion of the
Asian side came with the opening of Ankara AsfaltÄ±, the Asian extension of
the E5 highway, which is located to the north of BaÄdat Avenue, parallel to
the railway line. Another important factor in the recent growth of the Asian
side of the city was migration from Anatolia. Today, more than 1/3 of the
city's population live in the Asian side of Istanbul.

As a result of Istanbul's exponential growth during the second half of the
20th century, a significant portion of the city's outskirts consists of
gecekondus, a Turkish word created in the 1940s meaning âbuilt overnightâ
and referring to the illegally constructed squatter buildings that comprise
entire neighbourhoods and run rampant outside the historic centers of Turkey's
largest cities, especially Istanbul, Ankara, Ä°zmir, and Bursa. At present,
some gecekondu areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern
mass-housing compounds.

Istanbul is becoming increasingly colorful in terms of its rich social,
cultural, and commercial activities. While world famous pop stars fill
stadiums, activities like opera, ballet and theater continue throughout the
year. During seasonal festivals, world famous orchestras, chorale ensembles,
concerts and jazz legends can be found often playing to a full house. The
Istanbul International Film Festival is one of the most important film
festivals in Europe, while the Istanbul Biennial is another major event of
fine arts.

Pera Museum during the Rembrandt exhibition in 2006

Istanbul Modern, frequently hosts the exhibitions of renowned Turkish and
foreign artists. Pera Museum and SakÄ±p SabancÄ± Museum have hosted the
exhibitions of world famous artists and are among the most important private
museums in the city. The DoÄanÃ§ay Museum \- Turkeyâs first contemporary
art museum - is dedicated almost exclusively to the work of its founder Burhan
DoÄanÃ§ay. The Rahmi M. KoÃ§ Museum on the Golden Horn is an industrial
museum that exhibits historic industrial equipment such as cars and
locomotives from the 1800s and early 1900s, as well as boats, submarines,
aircraft, and other similar vintage machines from past epochs.

Istanbul Archaeology Museum, established in 1881, is one of the largest
museums of its kind in the world. The museum contains more than 1,000,000
archaeological pieces from the Mediterranean basin, the Balkans, the Middle
East, North Africa and Central Asia. Istanbul Mosaic Museum contains the late
Roman and early Byzantine floor mosaics and wall ornaments of the Great Palace
of Constantinople. The nearby Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum displays a vast
collection of items from various Islamic civilizations. Sadberk HanÄ±m Museum
contains a wide variety of artifacts, dating from the earliest Anatolian
civilizations to the Ottomans.

The Grand Bazaar

Occasionally, in November, the Silahhane (Armory Hall) of YÄ±ldÄ±z Palace
hosts the Istanbul Antiques Fair, which brings together rare pieces of
antiques from the Orient and Occident. The multi-storey MecidiyekÃ¶y
AntikacÄ±lar ÃarÅÄ±sÄ± (MecidiyekÃ¶y Antiques Bazaar) in the MecidiyekÃ¶y
quarter of ÅiÅli is the largest antiques market in the city, while the
Ãukurcuma neighbourhood of BeyoÄlu has rows of antiques shops in its
streets. The Grand Bazaar, edificed between 1455â1461 by the order of Sultan
Mehmed the Conqueror also has numerous antiques shops, along with shops
selling jewels, carpets and other items of art and artisanship. Historic and
rare books are found in the Sahaflar ÃarÅÄ±sÄ± near BeyazÄ±t Square, and it
is one of the oldest book markets in the world, and has continuously been
active in the same location since the late Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman
periods.

A significant culture has been developed around what is known as a Turkish
Bath. It was a culture of leisure during the Ottoman period, the finest
example being the ÃemberlitaÅ HamamÄ± (1584) in Istanbul, located on the
ÃemberlitaÅ (Column of Constantine) Square.[67]

Live shows and concerts are hosted at a number of locations including
historical sites such as the Hagia Irene, Rumeli Fortress, Yedikule Castle,
the courtyard of TopkapÄ± Palace, and GÃ¼lhane Park; as well as the AtatÃ¼rk
Cultural Center, Cemal ReÅit Rey Concert Hall and other open air and modern
theater halls.

### [edit] Media

The first Turkish newspaper, Takvim-i Vekayi, was printed on August 1, 1831 in
the BÃ¢bÄ±Ã¢li (BÃ¢b-Ä± Ãli, meaning The Sublime Porte) district. BÃ¢bÄ±Ã¢li
became the main center for print media. Istanbul is also the printing capital
of Turkey with a wide variety of domestic and foreign periodicals expressing
diverse views, and domestic newspapers are extremely competitive. Most
nationwide newspapers are based in Istanbul, with simultaneous Ankara and
Ä°zmir editions.[47] Major newspapers with their headquarters in Istanbul
include HÃ¼rriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, TÃ¼rkiye,
AkÅam, BugÃ¼n, Star, DÃ¼nya, TercÃ¼man, GÃ¼neÅ, Vatan, Posta, Takvim, Vakit,
Yeni Åafak, Fanatik and Turkish Daily News. There are also numerous local and
national TV and radio stations located in Istanbul, such as CNBC-e, CNN TÃ¼rk,
MTV TÃ¼rkiye, Fox TÃ¼rkiye, Fox Sports TÃ¼rkiye, NTV, Kanal D, ATV, Show TV,
Star TV, Cine5, SKY TÃ¼rk, TGRT Haber, Kanal 7, Kanal TÃ¼rk, Flash TV and many
others. In the city of Istanbul, there are over a hundred FM-radio stations.

### [edit] Recreation

â If one had but a single glance to give the world, one should gaze on
Istanbul. â  
âAlphonse de Lamartine  
Traditional beach resorts had gradually disappeared due to water pollution.
Recently, however, old places have reopened in the city. The most popular
places for swimming in the city are in BakÄ±rkÃ¶y, KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kÃ§ekmece, SarÄ±yer
and the Bosphorus. Outside the city are the Marmara Sea's Princes' Islands,
Silivri and Tuzla; as well as Kilyos and Åile on the Black Sea.

The Princes' Islands (Prens AdalarÄ±) are a group of islands in the Marmara
Sea, south of the quarters Kartal and Pendik. Pine and stone-pine wooden
neoclassical and art nouveau-style Ottoman era summer mansions from the 19th
and early 20th centuries, horse-drawn carriages (motor vehicles are not
permitted) and seafood restaurants make them a popular destination. They can
be reached by ferry boats or high-speed catamaran Seabus (Deniz otobÃ¼sÃ¼)
from EminÃ¶nÃ¼ and BostancÄ±. Of the nine islands, only five are settled.

Åile is a distant and well-known Turkish seaside resort on the Black Sea, 50
kilometres (31 mi) from Istanbul, where unspoiled white sand beaches can be
found. Kilyos is a small calm seaside resort not far from the northern
European entrance of the Bosphorus at the Black Sea. The place has good
swimming possibilities and has become popular in the recent years among the
inhabitants of Istanbul as a place for excursions. Kilyos offers a beach park
with seafood restaurants and night clubs, being particularly active in the
summer with many night parties and live concerts on the beach.

Istanbul has numerous historic shopping centers, such as the Grand Bazaar
(1461), MahmutpaÅa Bazaar (1462) and the Egyptian Bazaar (1660). The first
modern shopping mall was Galleria AtakÃ¶y (1987), which was followed by dozens
of others in the later decades, such as Akmerkez (1993) which is the only mall
to win both "Europe's Best" and "World's Best" awards by the ICSC; Metrocity
(2003); Cevahir Mall (2005) which is the largest mall in Europe; and Kanyon
Mall (2006) which won the 2006 Cityscape Architectural Review Award for its
interesting design. Ä°stinye Park (2007) and City's NiÅantaÅÄ± (2008) are
two new malls which target high-end consumers and are almost exclusively
dedicated to world-famous fashion brands.

#### [edit] Restaurants

Along with the traditional Turkish restaurants, many European and Far Eastern
restaurants and numerous other cuisines are also thriving in the city.

<IMG>

ÃiÃ§ek PasajÄ± on Ä°stiklal Avenue

Most of the city's historic winehouses (meyhane in Turkish) and pubs are
located in the areas around Ä°stiklal Avenue in BeyoÄlu. The 19th century
ÃiÃ§ek PasajÄ± (literally Flower Passage in Turkish, or CitÃ© de PÃ©ra in
French) on Ä°stiklal Avenue, which has many historic meyhanes, pubs and
restaurants, was built by Hristaki ZoÄrafos Efendi at the former site of the
Naum Theatre and was inaugurated in 1876. The famous NevizÃ¢de Street, which
has rows of historic meyhanes next to each other, is also in this area.

<IMG>

Cezayir Sokak in BeyoÄlu, also referred to as La Rue FranÃ§aise, has numerous
pubs, cafÃ©s and restaurants playing live music

Other historic pubs are found in the areas around TÃ¼nel PasajÄ± and the
nearby AsmalÄ±mescit SokaÄÄ±. Some historic neighbourhoods around Ä°stiklal
Avenue have recently been recreated, with differing levels of success such as
Cezayir Sokak near Galatasaray Lisesi, which became unofficially known as La
Rue FranÃ§aise and has rows of pubs including francophone ones, cafÃ©s and
restaurants playing live music.

Istanbul is also famous for its historic seafood restaurants. Many of them
were originally established by the local Greeks. The most popular seafood
restaurants are generally found along the shores of the Bosphorus and by the
Marmara Sea shore towards the south of the city. The Princes' Islands in the
Sea of Marmara (BÃ¼yÃ¼k Ada, Heybeli Ada, KÄ±nalÄ± Ada, Burgaz Ada) and
Anadolu KavaÄÄ± near the northern entrance of the Bosphorus towards the Black
Sea (close to Yoros Castle, which was also known as the Genoese Castle due to
Genoa's possession of it in the mid-15th century) also have many historic
seafood restaurants.

#### [edit] Night life

<IMG>

NiÅantaÅÄ±, the fashion district

There are many night clubs, pubs, restaurants and taverns with live music in
the city. The night clubs, restaurants and bars increase in number and move to
open air spaces in the summer. The areas around Istiklal Avenue and
NiÅantaÅÄ± offer all sorts of cafÃ©s, restaurants, pubs and clubs as well as
art galleries, theaters and cinemas.

The most popular open air summer time seaside night clubs are found on the
Bosphorus, such as Reina, Sortie and Anjelique in the OrtakÃ¶y district.
Babylon and Nu Pera in BeyoÄlu are popular night clubs both in the summer and
in the winter, while Istanbul Arena in Maslak frequently hosts the live

Marmara University

Istanbul holds some of the finest institutions of higher education in Turkey,
including more than 20 public and private universities. Most of the reputable
universities are public, but in recent years there has also been an upsurge in
the number of private universities. Istanbul University (1453) is the oldest
Turkish educational institution in the city, while Istanbul Technical
University (1773) is the world's second-oldest technical university dedicated
entirely to engineering sciences. Other prominent state universities in
Istanbul are the BoÄaziÃ§i University (1863), Mimar Sinan University of Fine
Arts (1882), Marmara University (1883), YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University (1911)
and Galatasaray University (1992). The major private universities in the city

<IMG>

<IMG>

Galatasaray Lisesi

Galatasaray Lisesi, established in 1481 as Galata SarayÄ± Enderun-u HÃ¼mayunu
(Galata Palace Imperial School) and later known as Galatasaray Mekteb-i
Sultanisi (Galatasaray School of the Sultans) is the oldest Turkish high
school in Istanbul and the second oldest Turkish educational institution in
the city after Istanbul University which was established in 1453. Galatasaray
gives education primarily in Turkish and French, but there are also courses in
English, Italian, Latin, Greek, Ottoman Turkish, Persian and Arabic.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Ä°stanbul Lisesi

Ä°stanbul Lisesi, also commonly known as Ä°stanbul Erkek Lisesi (established
in 1884), abbreviated Ä°EL, is one of the oldest and internationally renowned
high schools of Turkey located in Ä°stanbul. The school is considered among
the elite of Turkish public high schools. Germany recognizes the school as a
Deutsche Auslandsschule (German International School).

Almost all Turkish private high schools and universities in Istanbul teach in
English, German or French as the primary foreign language, usually accompanied
by a secondary foreign language.

Fen Liseleri (Science High Schools) were established with the aim of providing
education to exceptionally gifted students in mathematics, physics, chemistry
and other sciences. These are boarding schools which offer a three-year
program with a curriculum that emphasises science and mathematics. The schools
have a standard class size of 24 pupils and the language of instruction is
Turkish.

Anadolu Liseleri (Anatolian High Schools) were originally furnished for the
Turkish children who returned home from foreign countries, such as the
ÃskÃ¼dar Anadolu Lisesi with German as the primary foreign language and
technical instruction in German. KadÄ±kÃ¶y Anadolu Lisesi on the Asian side,
however, is one of the first six special Ministry of Education Colleges
(Maarif Koleji) established in 1950s in big cities across Turkey. Those
English-medium colleges, too, were renamed as "Anadolu Lisesi" in subsequent
decades.

Kuleli Military High School

Kuleli Military High School is the only military high school in Istanbul,
located in ÃengelkÃ¶y district. The military high school have superior
facilities, and classes are as little as one-third the size of those in
civilian high schools. Scholastic performance is closely monitored. A summer
camp is devoted to sports and military instruction. It has a four year
program, and after completion, cadets from the school enter Kara Harp Okulu. A
small number of cadets also enter the school from civilian high schools.
Military high schools are all male schools, so all female cadets at Kara Harp
Okulu come from civilian high schools. Kara Harp Okulu is the only source of
commissioned officers for the Turkish Army. After graduation cadets are
required to serve for 15 years.

<IMG>

Robert College

There are many foreign high schools in Istanbul, most of which were
established in the 19th century in order to give education to the foreigners
residing in Istanbul, or to local Stambouliotes with European roots. Following
the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, most of these schools went under
the administration of the Turkish Ministry of Education, but some of them
still have considerable foreign administration, such as the Liceo Italiano
(Ãzel Ä°talyan Lisesi, 1861) which is still regarded as an Italian state
school by the government of Italy and continues to receive funding and
teachers from Rome. The oldest such school is the French LycÃ©e Saint-Benoit,
established in 1783 with its current name (the school's roots go back to
1362). Robert College, established in 1863, is the world's oldest American
school outside the United States. The first international school in the city,
Istanbul International Community School, was founded in 1911 to educate the
children of international professors at Robert College.[69] The name of the
school was Robert College Community School until 1979, when it was changed to
its current name, Istanbul International Community School (IICS).[70] With a
law passed by the Turkish Parliament in 1971, foreign universities in Turkey
(i.e. BoÄaziÃ§i University which was originally the university section of
Robert College) went under the jurisdiction of the Turkish state, but high
schools were allowed to operate with foreign headmasters and curricula, such
as the high school section of Robert College which continues to have an
American headmaster. Other similar examples are the LycÃ©e Notre Dame de Sion
(1856), Deutsche Schule Istanbul (1868), LycÃ©e Saint-Joseph (1870), ÃskÃ¼dar
American Academy (1876), LycÃ©e Saint-Michel (1886), Sankt Georg Austrian High
School (1892), Zappeion Greek Girls' High School, Italian Girls' Junior High
School, Esayan Armenian Girls' High School, Saint Jean Baptiste French Boys'
School, Saint Pulcherie Jesuit School, ZoÄrafyon Greek Boys' High School and
the British Girls' School. Phanar Greek Orthodox College (Fener Rum Erkek
Lisesi), established in 1454, is the oldest surviving and most prestigious
Greek high school in the city. Many Ottoman viziers as well as Wallachian and
Moldavian princes appointed by the Ottoman state were graduated from this
school.

Air racing is new to the city. On 29 July 2006, Istanbul hosted the 5th leg of
the spectacular Red Bull Air Race World Series, as well as the 4th leg on 2
June 2007, in both cases above the Golden Horn.

Personal sports like golf, horse riding and tennis are gaining popularity as
the city hosts international tournaments such as the WTA Istanbul Cup. For
aerobics and bodybuilding, numerous fitness clubs are available. Paintball is
a sport which has recently gained popularity and is practiced by two large
clubs in the proximity of Istanbul. Martial arts and other Eastern disciplines
and practices such as Aikido and Yoga can be exercised in several centers
across the city. Istanbul also hosts the annual MTB races in the nearby
Belgrad Forest and BÃ¼yÃ¼kada Island. Two of the most prominent cycling teams
of Turkey, namely the Scott/Marintek MTB Team and the Kron/Sektor Bikes/Efor
Bisiklet MTB Team, are from Istanbul.
