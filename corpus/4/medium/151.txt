English as Peking (/piËËkÉªÅ/listen (info) or /peÉªËkÉªÅ/)) is a
metropolis in northern China and the capital of the People's Republic of
China. It is one of the four municipalities of the PRC, which are equivalent
to provinces in China's administrative structure. The municipality of Beijing
borders Hebei Province to the north, west, south, and for a small section in
the east, and Tianjin Municipality to the southeast.[6] Beijing is one of the
Four Great Ancient Capitals of China.[7]

Beijing is China's second largest city, after Shanghai.[8] Beijing is a major
transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and motorways passing
through the city. It is also the focal point of many international flights to
China. Beijing is recognised as the political, educational, and cultural
center of the People's Republic of China,[8] while Shanghai and Hong Kong
predominate in economic fields.[9][10][11] The city hosted the 2008 Olympic
Games.

Few cities in the world besides Beijing have served as the political and
cultural centre of an area as immense as China for so long.[12] The
EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica describes it as, "One of the world's great
cities,"[13] and declares that the city has been an integral part of Chinaâs
history for centuries, and there is scarcely a major building of any age in
Beijing that doesn't have at least some national historical significance.[12]
Beijing is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, and huge stone walls and
gates.[14] Its art treasures and universities have long made the city a centre
of culture and art in China.[14]

## [edit] Names

Beijing or Peking (åäº¬) means "northern capital", in line with the common
East Asian tradition whereby capital cities are explicitly named as such.
Other cities that are similarly named include Nanjing (åäº¬), China, meaning
"southern capital"; Tokyo (æ±äº¬), Japan, and ÄÃ´ng Kinh (Chinese: æ±äº¬,
now Hanoi), Vietnam, both meaning "eastern capital"; as well as Kyoto
(äº¬é½), Japan, and Gyeongseong (äº¬å; now Seoul), Korea, both meaning
simply "capital".

Peking is the name of the city according to Chinese Postal Map Romanization,
and the traditional customary name for Beijing in English (passports issued by
the British Embassy are still printed as being issued by the "British Embassy,
Peking"). The term Peking originated with French missionaries four hundred
years ago and corresponds to an older pronunciation predating a subsequent
sound change in Mandarin from [kÊ²] to [tÉ][15] ([tÉ] is represented in
pinyin as j, as in Beijing). It is still used in many languages.

The pronunciation "Peking" is also closer to the Fujianese dialect of Amoy or
Min Nan spoken in the city of Xiamen, a port where European traders first
landed in the 16th century, while "Beijing" more closely approximates the
Mandarin dialect's pronunciation.[16]

The city has been renamed several times. During the Jin Dynasty, the city was
known as Zhongdu (ä¸­é½) , and then later under the Mongol Yuan Dynasty as
Dadu (å¤§é½) in Chinese[17] and Daidu to Mongols[18] (also recorded as
Cambuluc[8] by Marco Polo). Twice in the city's history, the name was changed
from Beijing (Peking) to Beiping (Peiping) (åå¹³ Pinyin: Beiping; Wade-
Giles: Pei-p'ing), literally "Northern Peace". This occurred first under the
Hongwu Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, and again in 1928 with the Kuomintang
(KMT) government of the Republic of China.[8] On each occasion, the name
change removed the element meaning "capital" (jing or king, Chinese: äº¬) to
reflect the fact the national capital had changed to Nanjing. The city's name
was also twice changed from Beiping (Peiping) to Beijing (Peking). This
occurred first under the Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, who moved the
capital from Nanjing back to Beijing, and again in 1949, when the Communist
Party of China restored Beijing as China's capital after the founding of the
People's Republic of China.[8]

Yanjing (çäº¬; Pinyin: YÄnjÄ«ng; Wade-Giles: Yen-ching) is and has been
another popular informal name for Beijing, a reference to the ancient State of
Yan that existed here during the Zhou Dynasty. This name is reflected in the
locally brewed Yanjing Beer as well as Yenching University, an institution of
higher learning that was merged into Peking University.

    The history section below outlines other historical names of Beijing.

### [edit] Early history

<IMG>

<IMG>

Zhoukoudian

The earliest remnants of human habitation in the Beijing municipality are
found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in
Fangshan District, where the Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from the
caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic homo sapiens also
lived there about 27,000 years ago.[19] There were cities in the vicinities of
Beijing by the 1st millennium BC, and the capital of the State of Yan, one of
the powers of the Warring States Period (473-221 BC), Ji (è/è), was
established in present-day Beijing.[1]

After the fall of the Yan, the subsequent Qin, Han, and Jin dynasties set up
local prefectures in the area.[1] During the fall of the Han, it was the seat
of the warlord Gongsun Zan. In Tang Dynasty it became the headquarters for
Fanyang jiedushi, the virtual military governor of current northern Hebei
area. The An Shi Rebellion was also launched from here in 755 AD.

### [edit] Medieval period

In 936, the Later Jin Dynasty (936-947) of northern China ceded a large part
of its northern frontier, including modern Beijing, to the Khitan Liao
Dynasty. In 938, the Liao Dynasty set up a secondary capital in what is now
Beijing, and called it Nanjing (the "Southern Capital"). In 1125, the Jurchen
Jin Dynasty conquered Liao, and in 1153 moved its capital to Liao's Nanjing,
calling it Zhongdu (ä¸­é½), the "central capital."[1] Zhongdu was situated in
what is now the area centered around Tianningsi, slightly to the southwest of
central Beijing. Some of the oldest existing relics in Beijing, such as the
Tianning Temple, date to the Liao era.

Mongol forces burned Zhongdu to the ground in 1215.[20] Later in 1264, in
preparation for the conquest of all of China to establish the Yuan Dynasty,
Kublai Khan decided to rebuild it slightly north to the center of the Jin
capital,[21] and in 1272, he made this city his capital as Dadu (å¤§é½,
Chinese for "great capital"),[20] or Daidu to the Mongols, otherwise spelled
as Cambaluc or Cambuluc in Marco Polo's accounts. Construction of Dadu
finished in 1293.[1] The decision of Kublai Khan greatly enhanced the status
of a city that had been situated on the northern fringe of China proper. The
center of Dadu was situated slightly north of modern central Beijing. It
centered on what is now the northern stretch of the 2nd Ring Road, and
stretched northwards to between the 3rd and 4th Ring Roads. There are remnants
of the Yuan-era wall still standing, and they are known as the Tucheng (åå
literally, the 'earth wall').[22]

### [edit] Ming and Qing period

In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming Dynasty and future Hongwu
Emperor, made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan
capital. The last Yuan emperor fled north to Shangdu and Zhu declared the
founding of the Ming Dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the
ground.[23] The city was renamed to Beiping (åå¹³), or "northern peace" in
the same year,[24] and Shuntian (é å¤©) prefecture was established in the
area around the city.[25] In 1403, the new (and third) Ming emperor - the
Yongle Emperor \- renamed this city to Beijing (åäº¬), or "northern
capital",[24] and designated Beijing to be the co-capital alongside the (then)
current capital of Nanjing. Beijing was the subject of a major construction
project for a new Imperial residence, the Forbidden City that lasted nearly 15
years (1406 to 1420).[20] When the palace was finished, the Yongle Emperor
ceremoniously took up residence. From 1421 onwards, Beijing, also known as
Jingshi (äº¬å¸),[24] was the "official" capital of the Ming Dynasty while
Nanjing was demoted to the status of "secondary" capital. This system of dual
capitals (with Beijing being vastly more important) continued for the duration
of the Ming Dynasty. Thirteen of the sixteen Ming Emperors are buried in
elaborate tombs near Beijing.

By the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape, and the
Ming-era city wall served as the Beijing city wall until modern times, when it
was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.[26] It is
believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world from 1425 to 1650 and
from 1710 to 1825.[27] Other notable buildings constructed during the Ming
period include the Temple of Heaven (built by 1420).[28] The Tiananmen Gate,
now a state symbol of the People's Republic of China and featured on its
emblem, was first built in 1420, and rebuilt several times later. Tiananmen
Square was built in 1651 and enlarged in 1958.[29] Jesuits finished building
the first Beijing-area Roman Catholic church in 1652 at the Xuanwu Gate, where
Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552â1610) had lived; the modern Nantang (åå
, Southern Cathedral) has been built over the original cathedral.[30]

The end of the Ming came in 1644 when, for 40 days, Li Zicheng's peasant army
captured Beijing and overthrew the Ming government. When the powerful Manchu
army arrived at the outskirts of the city, Li and his followers abandoned the
city and as a result the Manchu forces, under Prince Dorgon, captured Beijing
without a fight.

Prince Dorgon established the Qing Dynasty as a direct successor to the Ming,
and Beijing remained China's capital.[31] The Qing Emperors made some
modifications to the Imperial residence, but in large part, the Ming buildings
and the general layout remained unchanged. Beijing at this time was also known
as Jingshi, which corresponded to the Manchu Gemun Hecen with the same
meaning.[32] The classic Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber is set in
Beijing during the early years of Qing rule (the end of the 1600s).

At the end of Qing period, Beijing was the scene of the siege of the foreign
legations during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.[33] Some important Imperial
structures in the city were destroyed during the fighting, including the
Hanlin Academy and the Summer Palace.

### [edit] Republican era

The Xinhai Revolution of 1911, aimed at replacing Qing rule with a republic,
originally intended to establish its capital at Nanjing. After high-ranking
Qing official Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the Qing emperor in Beijing
and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries in Nanjing
accepted that Yuan should be the president of the new Republic of China, and
that the capital should remain at Beijing. Yuan gradually consolidated power
and became by 1915 the new emperor but died less than a year into his
reign.[34] China then fell under the control of regional warlords, and the
most powerful factions fought frequent wars (the Zhili-Anhui War, the First
Zhili-Fengtian War, and the Second Zhili-Fengtian War) to take control of the
capital at Beijing. Following the success of the Kuomintang (KMT)'s Northern
Expedition, which pacified the warlords of the north, Nanjing was officially
made the capital of the Republic of China in 1928, and Beijing was renamed
Beiping (Peip'ing) (åå¹³) on 28 June that year,[35] in English meaning
"northern peace" or "north pacified".[8] During the Second Sino-Japanese
War,[8] Beiping fell to Japan on 29 July 1937,[36] and was made the seat of
the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled
the ethnic Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China;[37] the
government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei Government based in
Nanjing.[38]

### [edit] People's Republic

On 31 January 1949, during the Chinese Civil War, Communist forces entered
Beiping without a fight. On 1 October of the same year, the Communist Party of
China, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, announced in Tiananmen the creation
of the People's Republic of China and renamed the city back to Beijing.[39]
Just a few days earlier, the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference had decided that Beijing would be the capital of the new
government.

At the time of the founding of the People's Republic, Beijing Municipality
consisted of just its urban area and immediate suburbs. The urban area was
divided into many small districts inside what is now the 2nd Ring Road. The
Beijing city wall was torn down to make way for the construction of the 2nd
Ring Road, which was finished by 1981 in accord with the 1982 city plan. That
road was the first of a series of new ring roads intended for automobiles
rather than for bicycles.[40]

Following the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, the urban area of Beijing has
expanded greatly. Formerly within the confines of the 2nd Ring Road and the
3rd Ring Road, the urban area of Beijing is now pushing at the limits of the
recently constructed 5th Ring Road and 6th Ring Road, with many areas that
were formerly farmland now developed residential or commercial districts.[41]
According to a 2005 newspaper report, the size of the newly developed Beijing
land was one and a half times larger than the land of old Beijing within the
2nd Ring Road.[42] Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing
shopping districts,[43] while Zhongguancun has become a major centre of
electronics in China.[44] In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also
brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic,
poor air quality, the loss of historic neighbourhoods, and significant influx
of migrants from various regions of the country, especially rural areas.[45]

On 13 July 2001, the International Olympic Committee selected Beijing as the
host for the 2008 Summer Olympics.[46]

Beijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China
Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north,
northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland
from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the
municipality, especially Yanqing County and Huairou District, are dominated by
the Jundu Mountains, while the western part of the municipality is framed by
the Xishan Mountains. The Great Wall of China, which stretches across the
northern part of Beijing Municipality, made use of this rugged topography to
defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling in the
Xishan ranges and on the border with Hebei is the municipality's highest
point, with an altitude of 2303 m. Major rivers flowing through the
municipality include the Yongding River and the Chaobai River, part of the Hai
River system, and flow in a southerly direction. Beijing is also the northern
terminus of the Grand Canal of China which was built across the North China
Plain to Hangzhou. Miyun Reservoir, built on the upper reaches of the Chaobai
River, is Beijing's largest reservoir, and crucial to its water supply.

The urban area of Beijing is situated in the south-central part of the
municipality and occupies a small but expanding part of the municipality's
area. It spreads out in bands of concentric ring roads, of which the fifth and
outermost, the Sixth Ring Road (the numbering starts at 2), passes through
several satellite towns. Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace) and Tian'anmen
Square are at the centre of Beijing, and are directly to the south of the
Forbidden City, former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of
Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, residence of the paramount leaders of the People's
Republic of China. Running through central Beijing from east to west is
Chang'an Avenue, one of Beijing's main thoroughfares.

The city's climate is a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Koppen
climate classification Dwa), characterised by hot, humid summers due to the
East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the
influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.[47] Average daytime high
temperatures in January are at around 1 Â°C (33Â°F), while average
temperatures in July are around 30Â°C (87 Â°F). The highest temperature ever
recorded was 42 Â°C and the lowest recorded was -27 Â°C.[48] In 2005, the
total precipitation was 410.77 mm; the majority of it occurred in the
summer.[6]

### [edit] Air quality

Air pollution levels on an average day in Beijing are nearly five times above
World Health Organization standards for safety.[50] Joint research between
United States and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that a lot of the
city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. According to the
research, 34% of PM2.5 and on average 35-60% of ozone can be traced to sources
outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a
"significant influence on Beijing's air quality."[51]

August 2005, shows the contrasting air quality in Beijing in days of

In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and after promising to cleanup the
city's air, nearly US$17 billion was spent to clean the air, and Beijing had
implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the games.
This included stopping work on all construction sites, closing many factories
both in and around Beijing, closing some gas stations,[52] and cutting motor
traffic by half.[53] Two new subway lines were opened and thousands of old
taxis and buses were replaced to encourage residents to use public transport.
The Beijing government encouraged a discussion to keep the odd-even scheme in
place after the Olympics,[54] and although the scheme was eventually lifted on
21 September 2008, it was replaced by new restrictions on government
vehicles[55] and a new restriction making car owners use public transport once
a week based on their license plate, coming into force in October.[56] In
addition to the vehicle restrictions, staggered office hours and retail
opening times have been encouraged to avoid the rush hour, parking fees
increased, and 357,000 "yellow label" vehicles â those that have too high
emission levels â will be banned in Beijing altogether from January.[56]

According to the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), China has spent
17 billion[clarification needed] over the last three years on a large-scale
green drive. Beijing has added 3,800 natural gas buses, the largest fleet in
the world. Twenty percent of the Olympic venues' electricity comes from
renewable energy sources.[57] The city has also planted hundreds of thousands
of trees and increased green space in an effort to make the city more livable.

### [edit] Dust storms

Dust from erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in
seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification
Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and
mitigate their effects.[58] In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were
no fewer than eight such storms.[59] In April 2002, one dust storm alone
dumped nearly 50,000 tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and
Korea.[60]

Beijing Municipality comprises 18 administrative sub-divisions, county-level
units governed directly by the municipality (second-level divisions). Of
these, 16 are districts and 2 are counties. The urban and suburban areas of
the city are divided into eight (8) districts:[6]

  * Dongcheng District ä¸ååº
  * Xicheng District è¥¿ååº
  * Chongwen District å´æåº
  * Xuanwu District å®£æ­¦åº
  * Chaoyang District æé³åº
  * Haidian District æµ·æ·åº
  * Fengtai District ä¸°å°åº
  * Shijingshan District ç³æ¯å±±åº

The following six districts encompass the more distant suburbs and satellite
towns, constituting part of the metropolitan area:

  * Mentougou District é¨å¤´æ²åº
  * Fangshan District æ¿å±±åº
  * Tongzhou District éå·åº
  * Shunyi District é¡ºä¹åº
  * Changping District æå¹³åº
  * Daxing District å¤§å ´åº
  * Huairou District ææåº
  * Pinggu District å¹³è°·åº

The other two districts and the two counties located further out govern
semirural and rural areas:[61]

  * Miyun County å¯äºå¿
  * Yanqing County å»¶åºå¿

Towns  
Towns within Beijing Municipality but outside the urban area include (but are
not limited to):

  * Changping æå¹³
  * Huairou ææ
  * Miyun å¯äº
  * Liangxiang è¯ä¹¡
  * Liulimiao ççåº

  * Yizhuang äº¦åº
  * Tiantongyuan å¤©éè
  * Beiyuan åè
  * Xiaotangshan å°æ±¤å±±

  
Several place names in Beijing end with mÃ©n (é¨), meaning "gate", as they
were the locations of gates in the former Beijing city wall. Other place names
end in cÅ«n (æ), meaning "village", as they were originally villages outside
the city wall.

Beijing's 18 districts and counties are further subdivided into 273 lower
(third)-level administrative units at the township level: 119 towns, 24
townships, 5 ethnic townships and 125 subdistricts.

### [edit] Architecture

Inside the Forbidden City

Three styles of architecture predominate in urban Beijing. First, the
traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the
massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's
Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial
Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next there is what is sometimes
referred to as the "Sino-Sov" style, built between the 1950s and the 1970s,
with structures tending to be boxy, bland, and poorly made.[62] Finally, there
are much more modern architectural forms â most noticeably in the area of
the Beijing CBD and Beijing Financial Street.

Beijing of the early 21st century has witness tremendous growth of new
building constructions, showing various modern styles from international
designers. A mixture of both old and new styles of architecture can be seen at
the 798 Art Zone, which mixes 1950s design with a blend of the new.

## [edit] Politics and government

Main article: Politics of Beijing

Municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
in issuing administrative orders, collecting taxes, and operating the economy.
The local party authority is headed by the Beijing CPC Secretary
(åäº¬å¸å§ä¹¦è®°). The local CCP also directs a standing committee of the
Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing local
government. Local government figures include a mayor, vice-mayor, and numerous
bureaus focusing on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as
the capital of China, Beijing houses all the important national governmental
and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.[63]

Beijing is amongst the most developed cities in China with tertiary industry
accounting for 73.2% of its GDP, making it the first post industrial city in
mainland China.[64] Finance is one of the most important industries of
Beijing.[65] By the end of 2007, there are 751 financial organizations in
Beijing that generated 128.6 billion RMB revenue accounting for 11.6% of the
total financial industry revenue of the entire country. It is also accounts
for 13.8% of Beijing's GDP, the highest percentage of that of all Chinese
cities. [66]

In 2008, Beijing's nominal GDP was 1.0488 trillion RMB (150 billion USD), a
year-on-year growth of 9% from the previous year. Its GDP per capita was
63,029 RMB (9,075 USD), an increase of 5.2% from the previous year. In 2008,
Beijing's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 11.28 billion
RMB, 269.32 billion RMB, and 768.2 billion RMB. Urban disposable income per
capita was 24,725 yuan, a real increase of 12.4% from the previous year. Per
capita pure income of rural residents was 10,747 RMB, a real increase of
12.4%.[67] Per capita disposable income of the 20% low-income residents
increased 16.7%, 11.4 percentage points higher than the growth rate of the 20%
high-income residents. The Engel's coefficient of Beijing's urban residents
reached 31.8% in 2005 and that of the rural residents was 32.8%, declining 4.5
percentage points and 3.9 percentage points, respectively, compared with 2000.

Beijing's real estate and automobile sectors have continued to boom in recent
years. In 2005, a total of 28.032 million square metres of housing real estate
was sold, for a total of 175.88 billion RMB. The total number of cars
registered in Beijing in 2004 was 2,146,000, of which 1,540,000 were privately
owned (a year-on-year increase of 18.7%).[68]

The Beijing CBD, centred at the Guomao area, has been identified as the city's
new central business district, and is home to a variety of corporate regional
headquarters, shopping precincts, and high-end housing. The Beijing Financial
Street, in the Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen area, is a traditional financial
centre. The Wangfujing and Xidan areas are major shopping districts.
Zhongguancun, dubbed "China's Silicon Valley", continues to be a major centre
in electronics\- and computer-related industries, as well as pharmaceuticals-
related research. Meanwhile, Yizhuang, located to the southeast of the urban
area, is becoming a new centre in pharmaceuticals, IT, and materials
engineering.[69] Urban Beijing is also known for being a centre of pirated
goods and anything from the latest designer clothing to the latest DVDs can be
found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and
international visitors.[70]

Major industrial areas include Shijingshan, located on the western outskirts
of the city.[71] Agriculture is carried out outside the urban area of Beijing,
with wheat and maize (corn) being the main crops.[47] Vegetables are also
grown in the regions closer to the urban area in order to supply the city.

Beijing is increasingly becoming known for its innovative entrepreneurs and
high-growth start-ups. This culture is backed by a large community of both
Chinese and foreign venture capital firms, such as Sequoia Capital, whose head
office in China resides in Chaoyang, Beijing. Though Shanghai is seen as the
economic centre of China, this is typically based on the numerous large
corporations based there, rather than as a centre for Chinese
entrepreneurship.

The development of Beijing continues to proceed at a rapid pace, and the vast
expansion of Beijing has created a multitude of problems for the city. Beijing
is known for its smog as well as the frequent "power-saving" programmes
instituted by the government. Citizens of Beijing as well as tourists
frequently complain about the quality of the water supply and the cost of the
basic services such as electricity and natural gas. To reduce air pollution, a
number of major industries have been ordered to reduce emissions or leave the
city. Beijing Capital Steel, once one of the city's largest employers and its
single biggest polluter, has been moving most of its operations to
Tangshan.[72]

Specially designated industrial parks in Beijing include: Zhongguancun Science
Park, Yongle Economic Development Zone, Beijing Economic-technological
Development Area, and Tianzhu Airport Industrial Zone.

## [edit] Demographics

<IMG>

The population of Beijing Municipality, defined as the total number of people
who reside in Beijing for 6 months or more per year, was 17.4 million at the
end of 2007. There were 12.04 million people in Beijing Municipality who had
Beijing hukou (permanent residence), and the remainder were on temporary
residence permits.[2][3][4][5] In 2006, a study by the Beijing Statistics
Bureau estimated the total of all people living in Beijing (permanent,
temporary, unregistered and others) to be "close to 20 million."[73] Recent
statistics cited by China Daily put the number of migrant workers in the
service and construction industries in Beijing at "more than 5.1 million."[74]
In addition, there is a large number of migrant workers (min gong) who live
illegally in Beijing without any official residence permit (or unregistered
people).[75]

The population of Beijing's urban core (city proper) is around 7.7 million.
After Chongqing and Shanghai, Beijing is the third largest of the four
municipalities of the PRC, which are equivalent to provinces in China's
administrative structure.

Most of Beijing's residents belong to the Han Chinese majority. Other ethnic
minorities include the Manchu, Hui, and Mongol.[47] A Tibetan-language high
school exists for youth of Tibetan ancestry, nearly all of whom have come to
Beijing from Tibet expressly for their studies.[76] A sizable international
community exists in Beijing, many attracted by the highly growing foreign
business and trade sector, others by the traditional and modern culture of the
city. Much of this international community lives in the areas around the
Beijing CBD, Sanlitun, and Wudaokou. In recent years there has also been an
influx of South Koreans who live in Beijing predominantly for business and
study purpose. Many of them live in the Wangjing and Wudaokou areas.[77][78]

Ethnic groups in Beijing, 2000 census  
Nationality Population Percentage  
Han 12,983,696 95.69%

People native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the
Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. Beijing dialect is the basis for
Standard Mandarin, the language used in mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore.
Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of
Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.

Beijing opera, or Peking opera (Jingju äº¬å§), is well-known throughout the
national capital. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of
Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song,
spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences, such as gestures, movement,
fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic
stage dialect quite different from modern Standard Mandarin and from the
Beijing dialect.[80]

Siheyuans line hutongs (è¡å), or alleys, which connect the interior of
Beijing's old city. They are usually straight and run east to west so that
doorways can face north and south for Feng Shui reasons. They vary in width
â some are very narrow, enough for only a few pedestrians to pass through at
a time.

Once ubiquitous in Beijing, siheyuans and hutongs are now rapidly
disappearing, as entire city blocks of hutongs are leveled and replaced with
high-rise buildings.[81] Residents of the hutongs are entitled to live in the
new buildings, in apartments of at least the same size as their former
residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community
and street life of the hutongs cannot be replaced.[82] Residents, however,
have limited control over their own property, as the government usually owns
it.[83] Some particularly historic or picturesque neighbourhoods of hutongs
are being preserved and restored by the government, especially for the 2008
Olympics.[84]

Mandarin cuisine is the local style of cooking in Beijing. The Peking Roast
Duck is perhaps the most well-known dish. The Manhan Quanxi ("Manchu-Han
Chinese full banquet") is a rare traditional banquet originally intended for
the ethnic-Manchu emperors of the Qing Dynasty; it remains very prestigious
and expensive. The Fuling Jiabing is a traditional Beijing snack food, a
pancake (bing) resembling a flat disk with filling, made from fu ling (Poria
cocos (Schw.) Wolf, or "tuckahoe"), an ingredient common in traditional
Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing. Chinese tea comes in
many varieties and some rather expensive types of Chinese tea are said to cure
an ailing body extraordinarily well.

The cloisonnÃ© (or Jingtailan, literally "Blue of Jingtai") metalworking
technique and tradition is a specialty of Beijing's cultural art, and is one
of the most revered traditional crafts in China.[85] CloisonnÃ© making
requires elaborate and complicated processes which includes: base-hammering,
copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface
polishing and gilding.[85][86] Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for
its sophisticated and intrinsic patterns and images carved into its surface,
and the various decoration techniques of lacquer includes "carved lacquer" and
"engraved gold".

Younger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife,
which has flourished in recent decade, breaking prior cultural traditions that
practically restricted it to the upper class.[87]

Classical gardens in Beijing

At the heart of Beijing's historical centre lies the Forbidden City, the
enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and
Qing dynasties;[89] the Forbidden City also hosts the Palace Museum, which
contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City
are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably the
Beihai, Houhai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan. These places,
like the Beihai Park are described to be masterpieces of Chinese gardening
art,[90] and are popular tourist destinations with tremendous historical
importance; Zhongnanhai during the modern era has also been the political
heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters
of the Communist Party of China. From the Tiananmen Square, which is located
right across the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the
Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, National Museum of China,
Monument to the People's Heroes, and Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer
Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the urban
city of Beijing; the Summer Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[91] displays
a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that functioned as
the summer retreat for the Qing Dynasty emperors.

Among the best known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven
(Tiantan), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage
Site,[92] where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual
ceremonies of prayer to Heaven for good harvest; located in the opposite
direction of the Temple of Heaven at the northern part of the city are the
Temple of Earth (Ditian), and the Temple of the Sun (Ritan) and Temple of the
Moon (Yuetan), both respectively located in the eastern and western parts of
the urban area. Other well-known temple sites located in Beijing include the
Dongyue Temple, Tanzhe Temple, Miaoying Temple, White Cloud Temple, Yonghe
Temple, Fayuan Temple, Wanshou Temple and the Big Bell Temple. The city also
has its own Confucius Temple, and a Guozijian. The Cathedral of the Immaculate
Conception was built in 1605, and is the oldest Catholic church in Beijing.
The Niujie Mosque is also the oldest mosque in Beijing, with a history over a
thousand years old.

Beijing contains several well-preserved pagodas and stone pagodas, such as the
towering Pagoda of Tianning Temple, which was built during the Liao Dynasty
from 1100â1120, and the Pagoda of Cishou Temple, which was built in 1576
during the Ming Dynasty. Several historically important stone bridges are also
located in Beijing, including the 12th century Lugou Bridge, the 17th century
Baliqiao bridge and the 18th century Jade Belt Bridge. The Beijing Ancient
Observatory displays pretelescopic spheres dating back to the Ming and Qing
dynasties. The Fragrant Hills (Xiangshan) is a popular scenic public park that
consists of natural landscape areas as well as traditional and cultural
relics. The Beijing Botanical Garden exhibits over 6,000 species of plants,
including a variety of trees, bushes and flowers, and an extensive peony
garden. The Taoranting Park, Chaoyang Park, Haidian Park and Zizhu Yuan are
all popular recreational parks that consist of a variety of natural
landscapes. The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also
contains rare animals from various continents, including the giant panda of
China.

Beijing is also known for its siheyuan (courtyard houses) and hutong (alleys),
although they are increasingly disappearing due to the growth of city
constructions and are giving way to high-rises. The city has several well-
preserved neighborhoods of shiheyuan, including some of the more grand
courtyard houses, such as the Prince Gong Mansion. There are over hundreds of
museums in Beijing,[93][94] and aside from the Palace Museum in the Forbidden
City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the
National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the
Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of
China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of
China.[94]

Located at the outskirts of urban Beijing but within its municipality are the
Thirteen Tombs of the Ming Dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of
thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World
Heritage Site "Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties".[95] The
archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site
within the Beijing municipality,[96] and it contains a wealth of discoveries,
including one of the first specimens of Homo erectus, and an assemblage of
bones of the gigantic hyena Pachycrocuta brevirostris. There are several
sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China[97] that are on
the outskirts of the municipality, most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai
and Mutianyu.

## [edit] Transportation

Main article: Transportation in Beijing

With the growth of the city following economic reforms, Beijing has evolved as
the most important transportation hub in the People's Republic of China, and
within the larger East Asian region. Encircling the city are five ring roads,
nine expressways and city express routes, eleven China National Highways,
several railway routes, and an international airport.

<IMG>

The Beijing Railway Station

### [edit] Rail

Beijing has long been the largest railway hub in China. There are railway
lines from Beijing to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Harbin, Qinhuangdao,
Baotou, Yuanping, Chengde, and Tianjin. As of 1 August 2006, Beijing Railway
Station has 167 trains stopping daily, while Beijing West Railway Station has
176 trains. These two railway stations serve as major transportation nodes in
the city. The state-of-the-art Beijing South Railway Station opened in August
2008, and serves as the Beijing terminus for the Beijing-Tianjin high-speed
train, the fastest regular passenger train service in the world, as well as
all other high-speed CRH trains. International trains to cities in Mongolia,
Russia, and North Korea, all run through Beijing.

Several other railway stations in urban Beijing handle regular passenger
traffic: Beijing North, Beijing East, Fengtai and other smaller stations.
There are also a number of other stations serving suburban areas. Passenger
trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to
Beijing.

### [edit] Roads and expressways

    See: Ring Roads of Beijing, Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing for more related information.
<IMG>

<IMG>

Beijing is connected via road links from all parts of China as part of the
National Trunk Road Network. Nine expressways of China (with six wholly new
expressways under projection or construction) connect with Beijing, as do
eleven China National Highways. Within Beijing itself, an elaborate network of
five ring roads has developed, but they appear more rectangular than ring-
shaped. Due partly to its design as an ancient capital, roads in Beijing often
are in one of the four compass directions.

Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the five "ring roads" (Chinese:
ç¯è·¯) that successively surround the city, with the Forbidden City area
marked as the geographical centre for the ring roads. The 1st Ring road is not
officially defined. The 2nd Ring Road is fully located in Beijing's inner city
areas. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend
outwards, with the 5th Ring Road and 6th Ring Road being full-standard
National expressways - linked to other roads only with interchanges.
Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd
Ring Road outward.

One of the biggest concerns with traffic in Beijing involves its apparently
ubiquitous traffic jams, although in recent years ITS has been implemented in
many areas in attempts to alleviate the problem. Traffic in the city centre is
often gridlocked, especially around rush hour. Even outside of rush hour,
several roads still remain clogged up with traffic. Urban area ring roads and
major thoroughfares, especially near Chang'an Avenue, are normally cited as
high-congestion areas.

Exacerbating Beijing's traffic problems is its relatively underdeveloped mass
transit system. Frequently cited is the city's subway system which has 8 lines
for its 17 million citizens. In comparison, New York City has 26 lines for its
8 million citizens. Beijing's urban design layout further complicates the
situation of the transportation system.[100] Compounding the problem is patchy
enforcement of traffic regulations, and road rage. Beijing authorities claim
that traffic jams may be a thing of a past come the 2008 Olympics. The
authorities have introduced several bus lanes where, during rush hour, all
vehicles except for public buses must keep clear.

Chang'an Avenue runs east-west through the centre of Beijing, past Tian'anmen.
It is a major through route and is often called the "First Street in China" by
authorities.[101]

### [edit] Air

<IMG>

Beijing Capital International Airport's new Terminal 3

Beijing's primary airport is the Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA:
PEK; Chinese: åäº¬é¦é½å½é æºåº) near Shunyi, which is about 20 km
northeast of city centre. With renovations for the 2008 Olympics, the airport
now boasts three terminals, with Terminal 3 being one of the largest in the
world. Most domestic and nearly all international flights arrive at and depart
from Capital Airport. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China. The
capital links Beijing with almost every other Chinese city with regular air
passenger service. It is linked to central Beijing by the Airport Expressway
and is a roughly 40-minute drive from the city centre during good traffic
hours. Prior to the 2008 Olympics, another expressway, the 2nd Airport
Expressway, was built to the Airport, as well as a light rail system, which is
now connected to the Beijing Subway.

Other airports in the city include Beijing Liangxiang Airport, Beijing Nanyuan
Airport, Beijing Xijiao Airport, Beijing Shahe Airport and Beijing Badaling
Airport. Nanyuan serves as the hub for only one passenger airline, and these
airports are primarily for military use and less well-known to the public.

### [edit] Public transit

<IMG>

<IMG>

The Beijing Subway system opened in 1971, and only consisted of two lines
until the opening of the northern arc Line 13 in 2002. Due to recent
expansion, the evolving system now has nine lines, four of which are
underground, and five are above ground. Line 1, along with its new eastern
expansion known as the Batong Line crosses almost all of urban Beijing from
east to west. Line 5 serves as the north-south axial line. Fare is 2 yuan flat
throughout. There is an extensive system nearly 700 bus and trolleybus routes
in Beijing as of 2008, including three bus rapid transit routes.[102] All
public transportation can be accessed with the Yikatong card, which uses radio
frequencies to be scanned at subway stations and on public transit buses.

Registered taxis can be found throughout Beijing, although a large number of
unregistered taxis also exist. As of 30 June 2008, all fares on legal taxis
start at 10 Renminbi for the first 3 km and 2.00 Renminbi per additional
kilometer, not counting idling fees. Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai
Sonatas, Peugeot CitroÃ«ns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 km, the base fare
is increased by 50% (but only applied to the portion of the distance over 15
km, so that the passenger is not retroactively charged extra for the first 15
km). Between 11 pm and 5 am, the fee is increased by 20%, starting at 11 RMB
and increasing at a rate of 2.4 RMB per km. Rides over 15 km and between 11 pm
and 6 am apply both charges, for a total increase of 80% (120%*150%=180%).

## [edit] Education

<IMG>

Tsinghua University is a top university in mainland China

Beijing is home to a great number of colleges and universities, including
several well-regarded universities of international stature, such as Peking
University and Tsinghua University.[8] Owing to Beijing's status as the
political and cultural capital of China, a larger proportion of tertiary-level
institutions are concentrated here than in any other city in China, reaching
at least 59 in number. Many international students from Japan, Korea, North
America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere come to Beijing to study every
year. The institutions listed here are administered by China's Ministry of
Education.
