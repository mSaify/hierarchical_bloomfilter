The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization that
oversees the global financial system by following the macroeconomic policies
of its member countries, in particular those with an impact on exchange rates
and the balance of payments. It is an organization formed to stabilize
international exchange rates and facilitate development.[2] It also offers
financial and technical assistance to its members, making it an international
lender of last resort. Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., USA.

## [edit] Organization and purpose

<IMG>

<IMG>

Headquarters in Washington D.C.

The International Monetary Fund was created in 1944 [1], with a goal to
stabilize exchange rates and assist the reconstruction of the world's
international payment system. Countries contributed to a pool which could be
borrowed from, on a temporary basis, by countries with payment imbalances.
(Condon, 2007)

The IMF describes itself as "an organization of 185 countries (Montenegro
being the 185th, as of January 18, 2007), working to foster global monetary
cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade,
promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty".
With the exception of Taiwan, North Korea, Cuba, Andorra, Monaco,
Liechtenstein, Tuvalu, and Nauru, all UN member states participate directly in
the IMF. Most are represented by other member states on a 24-member Executive
Board but all member countries belong to the IMF's Board of Governors.[3]

### [edit] History

The International Monetary Fund was formally created in July 1944 during the
United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference. The representatives of 45
governments met in the Mount Washington Hotel in the area of Bretton Woods,
New Hampshire, United States of America, with the delegates to the conference
agreeing on a framework for international economic cooperation.[4] The IMF was
formally organised on December 27, 1945, when the first 29 countries signed
its Articles of Agreement. The statutory purposes of the IMF today are the
same as when they were formulated in 1944 (see #Assistance and reforms).

### [edit] Today

The IMF's influence in the global economy steadily increased as it accumulated
more members. The number of IMF member countries has more than quadrupled from
the 44 states involved in its establishment, reflecting in particular the
attainment of political independence by many developing countries and more
recently the collapse of the Soviet bloc. The expansion of the IMF's
membership, together with the changes in the world economy, have required the
IMF to adapt in a variety of ways to continue serving its purposes
effectively.

In 2008, faced with a shortfall in revenue, the International Monetary Fund's
executive board agreed to sell part of the IMF's gold reserves. On April 27,
2008, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn welcomed the board's
decision April 7, 2008 to propose a new framework for the fund, designed to
close a projected $400 million budget deficit over the next few years. The
budget proposal includes sharp spending cuts of $100 million until 2011 that
will include up to 380 staff dismissals.[5]

At the 2009 G-20 London summit, it was decided that the IMF budget will be
tripled to $750billion, to better meet the needs of the global community
amidst the late 2000s recession.[6][7]

## [edit] Data Dissemination Systems

In 1995, the International Monetary Fund began work on data dissemination
standards with the view of guiding IMF member countries to disseminate their
economic and financial data to the public. The International Monetary and
Financial Committee (IMFC) endorsed the guidelines for the dissemination
standards and they were split into two tiers: The General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) and the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

The International Monetary Fund executive board approved the SDDS and GDDS in
1996 and 1997 respectively and subsequent amendments were published in a
revised âGuide to the General Data Dissemination Systemâ. The system is
aimed primarily at statisticians and aims to improve many aspects of
statistical systems in a country. It is also part of the World Bank Millennium
Development Goals and Poverty Reduction Strategic Papers.

The IMF established a system and standard to guide members in the
dissemination to the public of their economic and financial data. Currently
there are two such systems: General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its
superset Special Data Dissemination System (SDDS), for those member countries
having or seeking access to international capital markets.

The primary objective of the GDDS is to encourage IMF member countries to
build a framework to improve data quality and increase statistical capacity
building. This will involve the preparation of metadata describing current
statistical collection practices and setting improvement plans. Upon building
a framework, a country can evaluate statistical needs, set priorities in
improving the timeliness, transparency, reliability and accessibility of
financial and economic data.

Some countries initially used the GDDS, but lately upgraded to SDDS.

Some entities that are not themselves IMF members also contribute statistical
data to the systems:

  * <IMG> Palestinian Authority â GDDS
  * <IMG> Hong Kong â SDDS
  * <IMG> European Union institutions: 
    * the European Central Bank for the Eurozone â SDDS
    * Eurostat for the whole EU â SDDS, thus providing data from <IMG> Cyprus (not using any DDSystem on its own) and <IMG> Malta (using only GDDS on its own)

## [edit] Membership qualifications

Any country may apply for membership to the IMF. The application will be
considered first by the IMF's Executive Board. After its consideration, the
Executive Board will submit a report to the Board of Governors of the IMF with
recommendations in the form of a "Membership Resolution." These
recommendations cover the amount of quota in the IMF, the form of payment of
the subscription, and other customary terms and conditions of membership.
After the Board of Governors has adopted the "Membership Resolution," the
applicant state needs to take the legal steps required under its own law to
enable it to sign the IMF's Articles of Agreement and to fulfil the
obligations of IMF membership. Similarly, any member country can withdraw from
the Fund, although that is rare. For example, in April 2007, the president of
Ecuador, Rafael Correa announced the expulsion of the World Bank
representative in the country. A few days later, at the end of April,
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez announced that the country would withdraw
from the IMF and the World Bank. Chavez dubbed both organisations as âthe
tools of the empireâ that âserve the interests of the Northâ. [2] As of
April 2008, both countries remain as members of both organisations. Venezuela
was forced to back down because a withdrawal would have triggered default
clauses in the country's sovereign bonds.

A member's quota in the IMF determines the amount of its subscription, its
voting weight, its access to IMF financing, and its allocation of Special
Drawing Rights (SDRs). The United States has exclusive veto power. A member
state cannot unilaterally increase its quota â increases must be approved by
the Executive Board and are linked to formulas that include many variables
such as the size of a country in the world economy. For example, in 2001,
China was prevented from increasing its quota as high as it wished, ensuring
it remained at the level of the smallest G7 economy (Canada).[8] In September
2005, the IMF's member countries agreed to the first round of ad hoc quota
increases for four countries, including China. On March 28, 2008, the IMF's
Executive Board ended a period of extensive discussion and negotiation over a
major package of reforms to enhance the institution's governance that would
shift quota and voting shares from advanced to emerging markets and developing
countries. The Fund's Board of Governors must vote on these reforms by April
28, 2008. See "Reform of IMF Quotas and Voice: Responding to Changes in the
Global Economy" at www.imf.org.

## [edit] Assistance and reforms

Main articles: Washington consensus and Structural adjustment program

The primary mission of the IMF is to provide financial assistance to countries
that experience serious financial and economic difficulties using funds
deposited with the IMF from the institution's 185 member countries. Member
states with balance of payments problems, which often arise from these
difficulties, may request loans to help fill gaps between what countries earn
and/or are able to borrow from other official lenders and what countries must
spend to operate, including to cover the cost of importing basic goods and
services. In return, countries are usually required to launch certain reforms,
which have often been dubbed the "Washington Consensus". These reforms are
generally required because countries with fixed exchange rate policies can
engage in fiscal, monetary, and political practices which may lead to the
crisis itself. For example, nations with severe budget deficits, rampant
inflation, strict price controls, or significantly over-valued or under-valued
currencies run the risk of facing balance of payment crises. Thus, the
structural adjustment programs are at least ostensibly intended to ensure that
the IMF is actually helping to prevent financial crises rather than merely
funding financial recklessness.

## [edit] IMF/World Bank support of military dictatorships

The role of the Bretton Woods institutions has been controversial since the
late Cold War period, as the IMF policy makers supported military
dictatorships friendly to American and European corporations. Critics also
claim that the IMF is generally apathetic or hostile to their views of
democracy, human rights, and labor rights. The controversy has helped spark
the anti-globalisation movement. Arguments in favor of the IMF say that
economic stability is a precursor to democracy; however, critics highlight
various examples in which democratized countries fell after receiving IMF
loans.[10]

In the 1960s, the IMF and the World Bank supported the government of
Brazilâs military dictator Castello Branco with tens of millions of dollars
of loans and credit that were denied to previous democratically-elected
governments.[11]

## [edit] Criticism

> "The interests of the IMF represent the big international interests that
seem to be established and concentrated in Wall Street."

> â Che Guevara, Marxist revolutionary, 1959 [13]

Two criticisms from economists have been that financial aid is always bound to
so-called "Conditionalities", including Structural Adjustment Programs. It is
claimed that conditionalities (economic performance targets established as a
precondition for IMF loans) retard social stability and hence inhibit the
stated goals of the IMF, while Structural Adjustment Programs lead to an
increase in poverty in recipient countries.[14]

One of the main SAP conditions placed on troubled countries is that the
governments sell up as much of their national assets as they can, normally to
western corporations at heavily discounted prices.

That said, the IMF sometimes advocates "austerity programmes," increasing
taxes even when the economy is weak, in order to generate government revenue
and balance budget deficits, which is Keynesian policy. Countries are often
advised to lower their corporate tax rate. These policies were criticised by
Joseph E. Stiglitz, former chief economist and Senior Vice President at the
World Bank, in his book Globalization and Its Discontents.[15] He argued that
by converting to a more Monetarist approach, the fund no longer had a valid
purpose, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out
Keynesian reflations, and that the IMF "was not participating in a conspiracy,
but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the Western financial
community."[16].

Argentina, which had been considered by the IMF to be a model country in its
compliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced
a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to have been caused
by IMF-induced budget restrictions â which undercut the government's ability
to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health,
education, and security â and privatization of strategically vital national
resources.[17] Others attribute the crisis to Argentina's misdesigned fiscal
federalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly.[18] The
crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other
South American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic
problems.[19] The current â as of early 2006 â trend towards moderate
left-wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development
of a regional economic policy largely independent of big business pressures
has been ascribed to this crisis.

Another example of where IMF Structural Adjustment Programmes aggravated the
problem was in Kenya. Before the IMF got involved in the country, the Kenyan
central bank oversaw all currency movements in and out of the country. The IMF
mandated that the Kenyan central bank had to allow easier currency movement.
However, the adjustment resulted in very little foreign investment, but
allowed Kamlesh Manusuklal Damji Pattni, with the help of corrupt government
officials, to siphon off billions of Kenyan shillings in what came to be known
as the Goldenberg scandal, leaving the country worse off than it was before
the IMF reforms were implemented.[citation needed] In an interview, the former
Romanian Prime Minister TÄriceanu stated that "Since 2005, IMF is constantly
making mistakes when it appreciates the country's economic performances".[20]

Overall the IMF success record is perceived as limited.[citation needed] While
it was created to help stabilize the global economy, since 1980 critics claim
over 100 countries (or reputedly most of the Fund's membership) have
experienced a banking collapse that they claim have reduced GDP by four
percent or more, far more than at any time in Post-Depression
history.[citation needed] The considerable delay in the IMF's response to any
crisis, and the fact that it tends to only respond to them or even create
them[21] rather than prevent them, has led many economists to argue for
reform. In 2006, an IMF reform agenda called the Medium Term Strategy was
widely endorsed by the institution's member countries. The agenda includes
changes in IMF governance to enhance the role of developing countries in the
institution's decision-making process and steps to deepen the effectiveness of
its core mandate, which is known as economic surveillance or helping member
countries adopt macroeconomic policies that will sustain global growth and
reduce poverty. On June 15, 2007, the Executive Board of the IMF adopted the
2007 Decision on Bilateral Surveillance, a landmark measure that replaced a
30-year-old decision of the Fund's member countries on how the IMF should
analyse economic outcomes at the country level.

### [edit] Impact on Public Health

In 2008, a study by analysts from Cambridge and Yale universities published on
the open-access Public Library of Science concluded that strict conditions on
the international loans by the IMF resulted in thousands of deaths in Eastern
Europe by tuberculosis as public health care had to be weakened. In the 21
countries which the IMF had given loans, tuberculosis deaths rose by 16.6
%.[22]

### [edit] Criticism from free-market advocates

Typically the IMF and its supporters advocate a monetarist approach. As such,
adherents of supply-side economics generally find themselves in open
disagreement with the IMF. The IMF frequently advocates currency devaluation,
criticized by proponents of supply-side economics as inflationary. Secondly
they link higher taxes under "austerity programmes" with economic contraction.

Currency devaluation is recommended by the IMF to the governments of poor
nations with struggling economies. Some economists claim these IMF policies
are destructive to economic prosperity.

Complaints are also directed toward International Monetary Fund gold reserve
being undervalued. At its inception in 1945, the IMF pegged gold at US$35 per
Troy ounce of gold. In 1973 the Nixon administration lifted the fixed asset
value of gold in favor of a world market price. Hence the fixed exchange rates
of currencies tied to gold were switched to a floating rate, also based on
market price and exchange. This largely came about because Petrodollars
outside the United States were more than could be backed by the gold at Fort
Knox under the fixed exchange rate system. The fixed rate system only served
to limit the amount of assistance the organisation could use to help debt-
ridden countries. Current IMF rules prohibit members from linking their
currencies to gold.[citation needed]

## [edit] Past managing directors

Historically the IMF's managing director has been European and the president
of the World Bank has been from the United States. However, this standard is
increasingly being questioned and competition for these two posts may soon
open up to include other qualified candidates from any part of the world.
Executive Directors, who confirm the managing director, are voted in by
Finance Ministers from countries they represent. The First Deputy Managing
Director of the IMF, the second-in-command, has traditionally been (and is
today) an American.

The IMF is for the most part controlled by the major Western Powers, with
voting rights on the Executive board based on a quota derived from the
relative size of a country in the global economy. Critics claim that the board
rarely votes and passes issues contradicting the will of the US or Europeans,
which combined represent the largest bloc of shareholders in the Fund. On the
other hand, Executive Directors that represent emerging and developing
countries have many times strongly defended the group of nations in their
constituency. Alexandre Kafka, who represented several Latin American
countries for 32 years as Executive Director (including 21 as the dean of the
Board), is a prime example. Mohamed Finaish from Libya, the Executive Director
representing the majority of the Arab World and Pakistan, was a tireless
defender[citation needed] of the developing nations' rights at the IMF until
the 1992 elections.

Rodrigo Rato became the ninth Managing Director of the IMF on June 7, 2004 and
resigned his post at the end of October 2007.

EU ministers agreed on the candidacy of Dominique Strauss-Kahn as managing
director of the IMF at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting in
Brussels on July 10, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the International Monetary
Fund's 24 executive directors elected Mr. Strauss-Kahn as new managing
director, with broad support including from the United States and the
27-nation European Union. Strauss-Kahn succeeded Spain's Rodrigo de Rato, who
retired on October 31, 2007.[23] The only other nominee was Josef Tosovsky, a
late candidate proposed by Russia. Strauss-Kahn said: "I am determined to
pursue without delay the reforms needed for the IMF to make financial
stability serve the international community, while fostering growth and
employment."[24]

## [edit] Media representation of the IMF

Life and Debt, a documentary film, deals with the IMF's policies' influence on
Jamaica and its economy from a critical point of view. In 1978, one year after
Jamaica first entered a borrowing relationship with the IMF, the Jamaican
dollar was still worth more on the open exchange than the US dollar; by 1995,
when Jamaica terminated that relationship, the Jamaican dollar had eroded to
less than 2 cents US. Such observations lead to skepticism that IMF
involvement is not necessarily helpful to a third world economy.

The Debt of Dictators [3] explores the lending of billions of dollars by the
IMF, World Bank multinational banks and other international financial
institutions to brutal dictators throughout the world. (see IMF/World Bank
support of military dictatorships)

Radiohead mentions the IMF in their song "Electioneering" on their 1997
release, OK Computer. The lyrics state, "It's just business/Cattle prods and
the IMF/I trust I can rely on your vote". Bruce Cockburn mentions the IMF in
his song "Call It Democracy". The lyrics state "IMF dirty MF/takes away
everything it can get/always making certain that there's one thing left/keep
them on the hook with insupportable debt".
