Latvia (en-us-Latvia.ogg /ËlÃ¦tviÉ/ (helpÂ·info); Latvian: Latvija,
officially Republic of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Republika) is a North
European Baltic country in the European Union. It is bordered to the north by
Estonia (343 km), to the south by Lithuania (588 km), and to the east both by
Belarus (141 km) and the Russian Federation (276 km).[4] Across the Baltic Sea
to the west lies Sweden. The territory of Latvia covers 64,589 kmÂ² and has a
temperate seasonal climate.

The Latvians are a Baltic people culturally related to the Estonians and
Lithuanians, with the Latvian language having many similarities with
Lithuanian, but not with the Estonian language. Today the Latvian and
Lithuanian languages are the only surviving members of the Baltic languages of
the Indo-European family. The modern name of Latvia is thought to originate
from the ancient Latvian name Latvji, which, like the name of Lithuania, may
have originated from the river named Latva or Latuva, which may be today's
Lates upe.[5]

Latvia is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic and is divided into 26
districts. The capital and largest city is Riga. Latvia has been a member of
the United Nations since 17 September 1991, of the European Union since 1 May
2004 and of NATO since 29 March 2004.

## [edit] History

Main article: History of Latvia

See also: List of museums in Latvia

The territory of Latvia has been populated since 9000 BC, after the Ice Age
glaciers retreated. Around the beginning of the third millennium BC (3000 BC)
the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast
of the Baltic Sea.[6] The Balts established trade routes to Rome and
Byzantium, trading local amber for precious metals. By 900 AD, four distinct
Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: Couronians, Latgallians, Selonians,
Semigallians (in Latvian: kurÅ¡i, latgaÄ¼i, sÄÄ¼i and zemgaÄ¼i), as well as
the Livonians (lÄ«bieÅ¡i) speaking a Finno-Ugric language.

### [edit] The Medieval period

Although the Balts had previous contacts with the outside world for centuries,
they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century. The
first missionaries, sent by the Pope sailed up the Daugava river by 1180,
seeking converts. The Balts, however, did not convert so readily as hoped, and
strongly opposed their Christianization. German crusaders were sent into
Latvia to convert the pagan population by force of arms.[7]

In the thirteenth century, a confederation of feudal nations called Livonia
developed under German rule. Livonia included today's Latvia and Southern
Estonia. In 1282, Riga and later the cities of CÄsis, LimbaÅ¾i, Koknese and
Valmiera were included in the Hanseatic League. From this time, Riga became an
important point in west-east trading. Riga, being the centre of the eastern
Baltic region, formed close cultural contacts with Western Europe.

### [edit] The Reformation period

The 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries were a time of great changes for the
inhabitants of Latvia, notable for the reformation, the collapse of the
Livonian state, and time when the Latvian territory was carved up among
foreign powers.

After the Livonian War (1558â1583), Livonia (Latvia) fell under Lithuanian
and Polish rule. The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia
were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Ducatus
Ultradunensis (PÄrdaugavas hercogiste). Gotthard Kettler, the last Master of
the Order of Livonia, formed the Duchy of Courland. Though the duchy was a
vassal state to Poland, it retained a large amount of autonomy and experienced
a golden age in the 17th century. Latgale, the easternmost region of Latvia,
became a part of Polish Inflanty.

The seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries saw a struggle between
PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth, Sweden and Russia for supremacy in the
eastern Baltic. After the Polish-Swedish War (1600-1611) northern Livonia
(including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule. Fighting continued sporadically
between Sweden and Poland until the Truce of Altmark in 1629. In Latvian, the
Swedish period is remembered as good Swedish age when serfdom was eased, a
network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the
regional barons was diminished.

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish
and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted Lutheranism as its main
religion. The ancient tribes of the couronians, semigallians, selonians, livs
and northern latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people speaking one
Latvian language. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of Lativa, south
latgallians adopted Catholicism as a part of the Polish/Jesuit influence. The
native dialect remained distinct, though it gained many Polish and Russian
loanwords.

### [edit] Latvia in the Russian Empire

The Treaty of Nystad ending the Great Northern War in 1721 gave Vidzeme to
Russia (it became part of the Riga Governorate). The Latgale region remained
part of Poland as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was joined to
Russia. The Duchy of Courland became a Russian province (the Courland
Governorate) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian
Empire.

The promises Peter the Great made to the Baltic German nobility at the fall of
Riga in 1710, confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad and known as "the
Capitulations," largely reversed the Swedish reforms. The 18th century was one
of the hardest for the peasantry, in which they received near-property status
without rights or education. Peasants were commanded to work on the manor
lands as many as six days of the week, leaving one day to look after their own
farms. The peasants turned to alcohol for their problems, which the local
barons faithfully provided, hoping to addict and exploit the peasantry for
further economic gain. These times were known as "Å Ä·idrÄs Maizes laiki" or
the days of liquid bread.

The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in
1819. In practice however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the
landowners and nobility. This was because it dispossessed the peasants of
their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates
"of their own free will".

During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically. A class of
independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to
repurchase their land, but many landless peasants persisted. There also
developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian
bourgeoisie. The Young Latvians (Latvian: JaunlatvieÅ¡i) movement laid the
groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders
looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated
social order. The rise in use of Latvian language in literature and society
became known as the First National Awakening. Russification began in Latgale
after the Polish led January Uprising in 1863 and spread to the rest of what
is now Latvia by the 1880s. The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the
New Current, a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s.
Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Revolution, which took on a
nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.

KÄrlis Ulmanis.

World War I devastated the country. Demands for self-determination were at
first confined to autonomy, but full independence was proclaimed in Riga on
November 18, 1918, by the People's Council of Latvia, KÄrlis Ulmanis becoming
the head of the provisional government. The War of Independence that followed
was a very chaotic period in Latvia's history. By the spring of 1919, there
were actually three governments â Ulmanis' government; the Soviet Latvian
government led by PÄteris StuÄka, whose forces, supported by the Red Army,
occupied almost all of the country; and the Baltic German government of
"Baltic Duchy" headed by Andrievs Niedra and supported by Baltische Landeswehr
and German Freikorps unit Iron Division. Estonian and Latvian forces defeated
the Germans at the Battle of CÄsis in June 1919, and a massive attack by a
German and Russian force under Pavel Bermondt-Avalov was repelled in November.
Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Polish, Latvian, and German
troops in early 1920.

A freely elected Constituent Assembly was convened on May 1, 1920 and adopted
a liberal constitution, the Satversme, in February 1922. This was partly
suspended by Ulmanis after his coup in 1934, but reaffirmed in 1990. Since
then, it has been amended and is the constitution still in use in Latvia
today. With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of
Russia in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the
young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by
1930, that percentage had been reduced to 23.2%. The extent of cultivated land
surpassed the pre-war level already in 1923. Innovation and rising
productivity led to rapid growth of economy, but it soon suffered the effects
of the Great Depression. Latvia showed signs of economic recovery and the
electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary
period. Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup on May 15, 1934, establishing a
nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940. Revolt against the government
was very unlikely however, because during "UlmaÅa Laiki" Latvia experienced
one of the highest standards of living in the world.

### [edit] Latvia in World War II

Early in the morning of August 24, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany
signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The
pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in
1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were
divided into German and Soviet "spheres of influence".[8] In the North,
Latvia, Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.[8] Thereafter,
Germany and the Soviet union invaded their respective portions of Poland.

Most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis'
government and Nazi Germany after the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop
Pact. On October 5, 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a "mutual assistance"
pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station 25,000
troops on Latvian territory. On June 16, 1940, Vyacheslav Molotov presented
the Latvian representative in Moscow with an ultimatum accusing Latvia of
violations of that pact. When international attention was focused on the
German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia.[9][10] State administrations were liquidated and
replaced by Soviet cadres,[9] in which 34,250 Latvians were deported or
killed.[11] Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for
many positions, with resulting peoples assembly immediately requested
admission into the USSR, which was granted by the Soviet Union.[9] Latvia,
then a puppet government, was headed by Augusts KirhenÅ¡teins.[citation
needed] The annexation was formalised on August 5, 1940.

The Soviets dealt harshly with their opponents â prior to the German
invasion, in less than a year, at least 27,586 persons were arrested; most
were deported, and about 945 persons were shot. While under German occupation,
Latvia was administered as part of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Latvian
paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by occupation authority
participated in the Holocaust as well. More than 200,000 Latvian citizens died
during World War II, including approximately 70,000 Latvian Jews murdered
during the Nazi occupation. Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the
conflict, including in the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS, most of them
conscripted by the occupying Nazi and Soviet authorities. Refusal to join the
occupying army resulted in imprisonment, threats to relatives, or even death.

### [edit] Soviet occupation

The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944â1945, and further mass
deportations followed as the country was forcibly collectivised and
Sovietised; 42,975 persons were deported in 1949. An influx of labourers,
administrators, military personnel and their dependents from Russia and other
Soviet republics started, and by 1959, the ethnic Latvian population had
fallen to 62%. During the Khrushchev Thaw, attempts by national communists led
by Eduards Berklavs to gain a degree of autonomy for the republic and protect
the rapidly deteriorating position of the Latvian language were suppressed.

### [edit] Restoration of independence

In 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution on the
"Occupation of the Baltic states", in which it declared that the occupation
was "not in accordance with law," and not the "will of the Soviet people". A
national movement coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia took advantage of
glasnost under Mikhail Gorbachev, opposed by the Interfront. On May 4, 1990,
the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted the Declaration of the
Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia, subject to a transition
period that came to an end with Latvian independence on August 21, 1991, after
the failure of the August Putsch. The Saeima, Latvia's parliament, was again
elected in 1993, and Russia completed its military withdrawal in 1994.

The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join NATO and the European Union,
were achieved in 2004. Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many
Russophones, although a majority have now become citizens. (Citizenship was
not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the
Soviet occupation or to their subsequent offspring. Children born to non-
nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled
to citizenship.) The government denationalised private property confiscated by
the Soviet rule, returning it or compensating the owners for it, and
privatised most state-owned industries, reintroducing the prewar currency.
Albeit having experienced a difficult transition to a liberal economy and its
re-orientation toward Western Europe, its economy has one of the highest
growth rates.[citation needed]

View from atop the tower of Gaizinkalns

Located on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, Latvia lies on the East
European Plain, however in vegetation is much different than the rest of the
plain and shares many similarities with the boreal biome. It consists of
fertile, low-lying plains, largely covered by forest, mostly pines, the
highest point being the GaiziÅkalns at 311.6 m (1,020 ft).
Phytogeographically, Latvia is shared between the Central European and
Northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal
Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Latvia belongs to the
ecoregion of Sarmatic mixed forests. The major rivers include the Daugava, the
Lielupe, the Gauja, the Venta, and the Salaca. An inlet of the Baltic Sea, the
shallow Gulf of Riga is situated in the northwest of the country. Latvia's
coastline extends for 531 kilometers.

### [edit] Fauna

Common species of wildlife in Latvia include deer, wild boar, moose, lynx,
bear, fox, beaver and wolves.[12] Non-marine molluscs of Latvia include 159
species.

### [edit] Climate

The Latvian climate is humid, continental and temperate owing to the maritime
influence of the Baltic Sea. Summers are warm, and the weather in spring and
autumn fairly mild; however, the winters can be extreme due to the northern
location. Precipitation is common throughout the year with the heaviest
rainfall in August. During severe spells of winter weather, Latvia is
dominated by cold winds from the interior of Russia, and severe snowfalls are
very common.

## [edit] Districts

Main article: Government of Latvia

The 100-seat unicameral Latvian parliament, the Saeima, is elected by direct
popular vote every four years. The president is elected by the Saeima in a
separate election, also held every four years. The president appoints a prime
minister who, together with his cabinet, forms the executive branch of the
government, which has to receive a confidence vote by the Saeima. This system
also existed before the Second World War.[14] Highest civil servants are
sixteen Secretaries of State.

### [edit] Foreign relations

Main article: Foreign relations of Latvia

Membership in the EU and NATO were major policy goals during the 1990s. In a
nation-wide referendum on September 20, 2003, 66.9% of those taking part voted
in favour of joining the European Union. Latvia became a member of the
European Union on May 1, 2004. Latvia has been a NATO member since March 29,
2004.

Treaty delimiting the boundary with Russia has been signed and ratified in
2007, under the treaty the Abrene district passes to Russia; ongoing talks
over maritime boundary dispute with Lithuania (primary concern is oil
exploration rights)

## [edit] Military

Main article: Military of Latvia

Latvia's defense concept is based upon the Swedish-Finnish model of a rapid
response force composed of a mobilization base and a small group of career
professionals. The armed forces consists of mobile riflemen, an air force, and
a navy. Latvia cooperates with Estonia and Lithuania in the joint infantry
battalion BALTBAT and naval squadron BALTRON which are available for
peacekeeping operations.

As of March 29, 2004, Latvia officially joined NATO. Currently, NATO is
involved in the patrolling and protection of the Latvian air space as the
Latvian army does not have the means to do so effectively. For this goal a
rotating force of four NATO fighters, which comes from different nations and
switches at two or three month intervals, is based in Lithuania to cover all
three Baltic states (see Baltic Air Policing).

## [edit] Economy

Main article: Economy of Latvia

<IMG>

<IMG>

A high rise building

Since the year 2000 Latvia has had one of the highest (GDP) growth rates in
Europe.[15] In 2006, annual GDP growth was 11.9% and inflation was 6.2%.
Unemployment was 8.5% â almost unchanged compared to the previous two years.
However, it has recently dropped to 6.1%, partly due to active economic
migration, mostly to Ireland and the United Kingdom. Some believe that
Latvia's flat tax is responsible for its high growth rate, but this is not
universally accepted. Privatisation is mostly complete, except for some of the
large state-owned utilities. Latvia is a member of the World Trade
Organization (1999) and the European Union (2004). Since 2001, Latvia's chief
export has been domestic livestock.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Real GDP growth in Latvia 1996â2006.

The fast growing economy is regarded as a possible economic bubble, because it
is driven mainly by growth of domestic consumption, financed by a serious
increase of private debt, as well as a negative foreign trade balance. The
prices of real estate, which were appreciating at approximately 5% a month,
are perceived to be too high for the economy, which mainly produces low valued
goods and raw materials. As stated by Ober-Haus, a real estate company
operating in Poland and the Baltics, the prices of some segments of the real
estate market have stabilised as of summer 2006 and some experts expect
serious reduction of prices in the near future. The government has recently
introduced a special programme to reduce inflation and retain high growth
rates.[citations needed] The main points of the plan are:

  * To create a non-deficit country budget for the current 2007 year and a budget with a surplus for 2008 and beyond;
  * to tax any transaction concerning real estate that has been in a person's possession less than three years;
  * to increase control of credit;
  * to increase energy effectiveness in homes and business to guard against possible rises in energy costs, and
  * to increase work productivity and stimulate competition in business.

Latvia plans to introduce the Euro as the country's currency but, due to the
inflation being above EMU's guidelines, the government's official target is
now 1 January 2012. However in October 2007, with inflation above 11%, the
head of the National Bank of Latvia suggested that 2013 may be a more
realistic date.[16]

Privatisation in Latvia is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously
state-owned small and medium companies have been successfully privatized,
leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies.
Latvian privatization efforts have led to the development of a dynamic and
prosperous private sector, which accounted for nearly 68% of GDP in 2000.

Foreign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in
north-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to
foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of Latvia's total foreign
direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. In the
same year, the United States exported $58.2 million of goods and services to
Latvia and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic institutions
like the World Trade Organization, OECD, and the European Union, Latvia signed
a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995--with a 4-year transition period.
Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment, trade, and
intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation.

### [edit] Economic contraction 2008

Main article: 2008-2009 Latvian financial crisis

The Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second
half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and
unrealistic inflation of real estate values. The national account deficit for
2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while
inflation was running at 10%.[17]

Paul Krugman, the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008, wrote in his New York
Times Op-Ed column for December 15, 2008:

    "The most acute problems are on Europeâs periphery, where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia: Latvia is the new Argentina " [18]
### [edit] Infrastructure

Main articles: Transportation in Latvia and National Roads in Latvia

The transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia and the West
is large.[19]

Key ports are in Riga, Ventspils, and Liepaja. Most transit traffic uses these
and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products.[19]

Riga International Airport is the largest airport with 3.2 million passengers
in 2007.

### [edit] Ethnic and cultural diversity

Main articles: Latvian people, Latvian Russians, Latvian Germans, Latvian
Jews, Latgalians, and Livonians

Latvia's population has been multiethnic for centuries, though the
demographics shifted dramatically in the twentieth century due to the World
Wars, the emigration and removal of Baltic Germans, the Holocaust, and
occupation by the Soviet Union.[citations needed]

Latvians and Livonians, the indigenous peoples of Latvia, now form about 59.2%
of the population; 28% of the inhabitants are Russians , Belorussians 3.7%,
Ukrainians 2.5% , Poles 2.4%, Lithuanians 1.3%, Jews 0.5%, Roma people 0.4%,
Germans 0.2%, Estonians 0.1% and others 1.7% [1]. Approximately 56% of the
ethnic Russians living in Latvia are citizens of Latvia.[21]

In some large cities, e.g. Riga, Daugavpils and RÄzekne, Russians and other
minorities outnumber Latvians. Minorities from other countries such as
Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, etc., also live in Latvia. The share of
ethnic Latvians had fallen from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 52% (1,387,757) in
1989.[22] In 2005 there were even fewer Latvians than in 1989, though their
share of the population was larger â 1,357,099 (57.% of the
inhabitants).[21]

Main articles: Languages of Latvia, Livonian language, and Latgalian language

The official language of Latvia is Latvian, which belongs to the Baltic
language group of the Indo-European language family. Another notable language
of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language of the Baltic-Finnic
subbranch of the Uralic language family, which enjoys protection by law; The
Latgalian language â a dialect of Latvian â is also protected by Latvian
law as a historical variation of the Latvian language. Russian which was
widely spoken during the Soviet period, and also during the Russian Imperial
period is by far the most widespread minority language and is also understood
by the majority of older Latvians.

Between the thirteenth and nineteenth century, Baltic Germans, many of whom
were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into German
culture, formed the upper class.[citation needed] They developed a distinct
cultural heritage, characterised by both Latvian and German influences. It has
survived in German Baltic families to this day, in spite of their dispersal to
Germany, the USA, Canada and other countries in the early 20th century.
However, most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular
cultural life.[citation needed] Thus, the mostly peasant local pagan heritage
was preserved, partly merging with Christian traditions, for example in one of
the most popular celebrations today which is JÄÅi, a pagan celebration of
the summer solstice, celebrated on the feast day of St. John the Baptist.

Caraway cheese is traditionally served on the Latvian festival JÄÅi.

In the nineteenth century Latvian nationalist movements emerged promoting
Latvian culture and encouraging Latvians to take part in cultural activities.
The nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century is often
regarded as a classical era of Latvian culture. Posters show the influence of
other European cultures, for example, works of artists such as the Baltic-
German artist Bernhard Borchert and the French Raoul Dufy.[citations needed]
With the onset of World War II, many Latvian artists and other members of the
cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work, largely
for a Latvian Ã©migrÃ© audience.[23]

After incorporation into the USSR, Latvian artists and writers were forced to
follow the Socialist realism style of art. During the Soviet era, music became
increasingly popular, with the most popular being songs from the 1980s. At
this time, songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were
concerned about preserving Latvian identity. This aroused popular protests
against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry.
Since independence, theatre, scenography and classical music have become the
most notable branches of Latvian culture.[citations needed]

### [edit] Religion

See also: Islam in Latvia

The largest religion is Christianity, although only 7% of population attend
religious services regularly.[24] The largest groups in 2006 are:

  * Lutheran â 400,000[citation needed]
  * Roman Catholic â 450,000[25]
  * Eastern Orthodox â 350,000[26]

According to the most recent Eurobarometer Poll 2005,[27] 37% of Latvian
citizens responded that "they believe there is a god", whereas 49% answered
that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 10% that
"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".
Lutheranism was much stronger before the Soviet occupation, when it was a
majority religion, but since then Lutheranism in all the Baltic States has
declined to a much greater extent than Roman Catholicism has. The country's
Orthodox Christians belong to the Latvian Orthodox Church, a semi-autonomous
body within the Russian Orthodox Church. There are 182 known Muslims living in
Latvia though the total number is estimated to be much larger: from 500 to
5,000. There are also Jews (9,743 in 2006) in Latvia.[citations needed]

There are more than 600 Latvian neopagans, Dievturi (The Godskeepers), whose
religion is based on Latvian mythology.[28] About 40% of the total population
is not affiliated with a specific religion.[citations needed]
