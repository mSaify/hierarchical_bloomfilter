Saint Petersburg (Russian: Ð¡Ð°Ð½ÐºÑ-ÐÐµÑÐµÑÐ±ÑÌÑÐ³?Â·i, tr.: Sankt-
Peterburg, Russian pronunciation: [sankt pÊ²ÉªtÊ²ÉªrËburk]) is a city and a
federal subject of Russia located on the Neva River at the head of the Gulf of
Finland on the Baltic Sea. The city's other names were Petrograd
(ÐÐµÑÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÐ°ÌÐ´, 1914â1924) and Leningrad (ÐÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð½Ð³ÑÐ°ÌÐ´,
1924â1991). It is often called just Petersburg (ÐÐµÑÐµÑÐ±ÑÌÑÐ³) and is
informally known as Piter (ÐÐ¸ÌÑÐµÑ).

Founded by Tsar Peter I of Russia on 27 May, 1703, it was the capital of the
Russian Empire for more than two hundred years (1713â1728, 1732â1918).
Saint Petersburg ceased being the capital in 1918 after the Russian Revolution
of 1917.[1] It is Russia's second largest and Europe's third largest city
after Moscow and London.[2] The city has 4.6 million inhabitants, and over 6
million people live in its vicinity. Saint Petersburg is a major European
cultural centre, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea.

Saint Petersburg is often described as the most Western city of Russia.[3]
Among cities of the world with over one million people, Saint Petersburg is
the northernmost. The Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups
of Monuments constitute a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Russia's political and
cultural centre for 200 years, the city is sometimes referred to in Russia as
the northern capital. A large number of foreign consulates, international
corporations, banks and other businesses are located in Saint Petersburg.

## History

Main article: History of Saint Petersburg

On 1 May, 1703, during the Great Northern War, Peter the Great captured the
Swedish fortress of Nyenskans on the Neva river in Ingria. A few weeks later,
on 27 May, 1703 (May 16, Old Style), lower on the river, on Zayachy (Hare)
Island, three miles (5 km) inland from the gulf, he laid down the Peter and
Paul Fortress, which became the first brick and stone building of the new
city. He named the city after his patron saint, Saint Peter, the apostle. The
original name was meant to sound like Dutch due to Peter's obsession with the
Dutch culture.[4] The city was built by conscripted serfs from all over Russia
and also by Swedish prisoners of war[5] under the supervision of Alexander
Menshikov and later became the centre of Saint Petersburg Governorate. Peter
moved the capital from Moscow to Saint Petersburg in 1712, before the Treaty
of Nystad of 1721 ended the war.

During the first few years of its existence the city grew spontaneously around
Trinity Square on the right bank of the Neva, near the Peter and Paul
Fortress. However, Saint Petersburg soon started to develop according to a
plan. By 1716 Domenico Trezzini had elaborated a project whereby the city
centre would be located on Vasilievsky Island and shaped by a rectangular grid
of canals. The project was not completed, but is still evident in the layout
of the streets. In 1716 Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond was appointed chief
architect of Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great. The style of Petrine
Baroque, developed by Trezzini and other architects and exemplified by such
buildings as the Menshikov Palace, Kunstkamera, Peter and Paul Cathedral,
Twelve Collegia, became prominent in the city architecture of the early 18th
century. In 1724 the Academy of Sciences, University and Academic Gymnasium
were established in Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great.

However, in 1725 Peter died. His near-lifelong autocratic push for
modernisation of Russia had met with considerable opposition from the old-
fashioned Russian nobility â resulting in several attempts on his life and a
treason case involving his own son.[6] Thus, in 1728, Peter II of Russia moved
his seat back to Moscow. But four years later, in 1732, under Empress Anna of
Russia, Saint Petersburg again became the capital of the Russian Empire and
remained the seat of the government for 186 years.

In 1736-1737 the city suffered from catastrophic fires. In order to rebuild
the damaged boroughs, in 1737 a new plan was commissioned by a committee under
Burkhard Christoph von Munnich. The city was divided into five boroughs, and
the city centre was moved to the Admiralty borough, situated on the left bank
between the Neva and Fontanka. It developed along three radial streets, which
meet at the Admiralty and are now known as Nevsky Prospekt (which is now
perceived as the main street of the city), Gorokhovaya Street and Voznesensky
Prospekt. The style of Baroque dominated the city architecture during the
first sixty years, culminating in the Elizabethan Baroque, represented most
notably by Bartolomeo Rastrelli with such buildings as the Winter Palace. In
the 1760s the Baroque architecture was succeeded by the neoclassical
architecture.

The Commission of Stone Buildings of Moscow and Saint Petersburg established
in 1762 ruled that no structure in the city be higher than the Winter Palace
and prohibited spacing between buildings. During the reign of Catherine the
Great in the 1760s-1780s the banks of the Neva were lined with granite
embankments. However, it wasn't until 1850 that it was allowed to open the
first permanent bridge across the Neva, Blagoveshchensky Bridge. Before that,
only pontoon bridges were allowed. Obvodny Canal (dug in 1769-1833) became the
southern limit of the city. Some of the most important neoclassical architects
in Saint Petersburg (including those working within the Empire style) were
Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe (Imperial Academy of Arts, Small Hermitage,
Gostiny Dvor, New Holland Arch, Catholic Church of St. Catherine), Antonio
Rinaldi (Marble Palace), Yury Felten (Old Hermitage, Chesme Church), Giacomo
Quarenghi (Academy of Sciences, Hermitage Theatre, Yusupov Palace), Andrey
Voronikhin (Mining Institute, Kazan Cathedral), Andreyan Zakharov (Admiralty
building), Jean-FranÃ§ois Thomas de Thomon (Spit of Vasilievsky Island), Carlo
Rossi (Yelagin Palace, Mikhailovsky Palace, Alexandrine Theatre, Senate and
Synod Buildings, General Staff Building, design of many streets and squares),
Vasily Stasov (Moscow Triumphal Gate, Trinity Cathedral), Auguste de
Montferrand (Saint Isaac's Cathedral, Alexander Column). The victory over
Napoleonic France in the Patriotic War of 1812 was commemorated with many
monuments, including Alexander Column by Montferrand, erected in 1834, and
Narva Triumphal Gate.

In 1825 the suppressed Decembrist revolt against Nicholas I of Russia took
place on the Senate Square in the city, a day after he assumed the throne.

By the 1840s the neoclassical architecture had given place to various
romanticist styles, which were dominant until the 1890s, represented by such
architects as Andrei Stackenschneider (Mariinsky Palace, Beloselsky-Belozersky
Palace, Nicholas Palace, New Michael Palace) and Konstantin Thon (Moskovsky
Rail Terminal). The Church of the Savior on Blood designed in the Russian
revival style commemorated the place where Alexander II of Russia was
assassinated in 1881.

With the emancipation of the serfs undertaken by Alexander II in 1861 and the
industrial revolution the influx of former peasants into the capital increased
greatly. Poor boroughs spontaneously emerged on the outskirts of the city.
Saint Petersburg surpassed Moscow in population and industrial growth and grew
into one of the largest industrial hubs and cities in Europe.

The Revolution of 1905 began in Saint Petersburg and spread rapidly into the
provinces. With the start of World War I, the name Saint Petersburg was
perceived to be too German, so in 1914 the city was renamed Petrograd.[7] In
1917 the February Revolution, which put an end to the Russian monarchy, and
the October Revolution, which ultimately brought Vladimir Lenin to power,
broke out in Petrograd.[8] The city's proximity to the border and anti-Soviet
armies forced the Bolsheviks under Lenin to transfer the capital to Moscow on
March 12, 1918.[9] In 1919 during the ensuing Russian Civil War Nikolay
Yudenich advancing from Estonia was about to capture the city from the
Bolsheviks, but Leon Trotsky ultimately managed to mobilise the population and
make him retreat. Many people fled the city in 1917-1920 or were repressed in
the Red Terror,[10] so its population decreased dramatically. On January 24,
1924, three days after Lenin's death, Petrograd was renamed Leningrad. For
decades Leningrad was glorified by the Soviet propaganda as "the cradle of the
revolution" and "the city of three revolutions", many spots related to Lenin
and the revolutions, such as the cruiser Aurora, were carefully preserved.
Many streets and other toponyms were renamed accordingly.

In the 1920s-1930s the poor outskirts were reconstructed into regularly
planned boroughs. The constructivist architecture flourished around that time.
The Soviets nationalised housing and forced many residents to share communal
apartments (kommunalkas). With 68% living in shared apartments in the 1930s,
Leningrad was the city with the largest number of kommunalkas. In 1935 a new
general plan was outlined, whereby the city should expand to the south and its
centre should move there. The constructivism was rejected in favor of the
pompous Stalinist architecture. Stalin ordered the construction of the new
city hall on Moskovsky Prospect thus making it the new main street of
Leningrad during the Soviet rule.

Since December 1931 Leningrad has been administratively separate from
Leningrad Oblast. At that time it included Leningrad Suburban District, some
parts of which were transferred back to Leningrad Oblast in 1936 and turned
into Vsevolozhsky District, Krasnoselsky District, Pargolovsky District and
Slutsky District (renamed Pavlovsky District in 1944).[11]

On December 1, 1934, Sergey Kirov, popular communist leader of Leningrad, was
assassinated, which was used to start the Great Purge.[12] The sizeable
minorities of Germans, Poles, Finns, Estonians and Latvians were almost
completely expelled from Leningrad by the Soviet government during the
1930s.[13]

During World War II, Leningrad was besieged by Nazi Germany and co-belligerent
Finland.[14] The siege lasted 872 days[14] from September 1941 to January
1944.[15] The Siege of Leningrad was one of the longest, most destructive, and
most lethal sieges of major cities in modern history. It isolated the city
from most supplies except those provided through the Road of Life across Lake
Ladoga, and more than a million civilians died, mainly from starvation. Many
others were eventually evacuated or escaped by themselves, so the city became
largely depopulated. For the heroic resistance of the city and tenacity of the
survivors of the Siege, in 1945 Leningrad became the first city in the Soviet
Union awarded the title Hero City. In October 1946 some former Finnish
territories along the northern coast of the Gulf of Finland captured in the
Winter War and Continuation War were transferred from Leningrad Oblast to
Leningrad and divided into Sestroretsky District and Kurortny District,
including the town of Terijoki (renamed Zelenogorsk in 1948).[11]

Leningrad and many of its suburbs were rebuilt over the post-war decades,
partially according to the pre-war plans. The 1948 general plan of Leningrad
featured radial urban development in the north as well as in the south. The
Leningrad Metro, underground rapid transit system which was designed before
the war in the 1930s, was opened in 1955 with its first seven stations
decorated with marble and bronze. Meanwhile, in 1949-1951 a large number of
prominent Leningrad members of the Communist Party and their families were
charged with treason and intention to create an anti-Soviet organization out
of their local party cell. Many were imprisoned or executed in the Leningrad
Affair fabricated by the central Soviet leadership.[16][17]

In 1953 Pavlovsky District of Leningrad Oblast was abolished, and parts of its
territory including Pavlovsk merged with Leningrad. In 1954 the settlements
Levashovo, Pargolovo and Pesochny merged with Leningrad.[11]

After the death of Stalin the perceived ornamental excesses of the Stalinist
architecture were abandoned. In the 1960s-1980s, as many new residential
boroughs were built on the outskirts with few series of functionalist
apartment blocks identical to each other, lots of families moved there from
kommunalkas in the city centre in order to live in separate apartments.

Uritsk was re-named Ligovo and merged with Leningrad in 1963, Lomonosov merged
in 1978.[11]

On June 12, 1991, in a referendum held on the same day as the first Russian
presidential election, 54% of voters chose to restore the name "Saint
Petersburg" (the change officially took effect on September 6, 1991). Many
other Soviet-era toponyms in the city were also renamed soon afterwards. In
the same election Anatoly Sobchak became the first democratically elected
mayor of the city.[18]

By the end of 1991 the deteriorating planned economy of the collapsing Soviet
Union had put the city on the verge of starvation. For the first time since
World War II food rationing was introduced, and the city received humanitarian
food aid from abroad. The city somewhat recovered with the market reforms in
Russia. In 1995-2004 a northern section of the Metro's Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya
Line was cut off by underground flooding, which was a major obstacle to the
city development.

In 1996, Vladimir Yakovlev was elected as head of the Saint Petersburg City
Administration. The title of the city head was changed in advance from "mayor"
to "governor". In 2003, Yakovlev resigned a year before his second term
expired. Valentina Matviyenko was elected governor. In 2006 she was reapproved
as governor by the city legislature.

The residential building had intensified again and had become more
architecturally diverse by the 2000s, though real estate prices inflated
greatly.

## Geography

<IMG>

Territory of the federal subject of Saint Petersburg.

The area of Saint Petersburg city proper is 605.8 km2 (233.9 sq mi). The area
of the federal subject is 1,439 km2 (556 sq mi), which contains the Saint
Petersburg proper (consisting of 81 okrugs), nine suburban towns (Kolpino,
Krasnoye Selo, Kronstadt, Lomonosov, Pavlovsk, Peterhof, Pushkin, Sestroretsk
and Zelenogorsk) and 21 municipal settlements.

Saint Petersburg is situated on the middle taiga lowlands along the shores of
the Neva Bay of the Gulf of Finland, and islands of the river delta. The
largest are Vasilyevsky island (besides the artificial island between Obvodny
canal and Fontanka, and Kotlin in the Neva Bay), Petrogradsky, Dekabristov and
Krestovsky. The latter together with Yelagin and Kamenny island are covered
mostly by parks. The Karelian Isthmus, North of the city, is a popular resort
area. In the south Saint Petersburg crosses the Baltic-Ladoga Klint and meets
the Izhora Plateau.

The elevation of Saint Petersburg ranges from the sea level to its highest
point of 175.9 m (577 ft) at the Orekhovaya Hill in the Duderhof Heights in
the south. Part of the city's territory west of Liteyny Prospekt is no higher
than 4 m (13 ft) above sea level, and has suffered from numerous floods.
Floods in Saint Petersburg are triggered by a long wave in the Baltic Sea,
caused by meteorological conditions, winds and shallowness of the Neva Bay.
The four most disastrous floods occurred in 1824 (421 cm/13.8 ft above sea-
level, during which over 300 buildings were destroyed[19]), 1924 380 cm/12.5
ft, 1777 321 cm/10.5 ft, 1955 293 cm/9.6 ft and 1975 281 cm/9.2 ft. To prevent
floods, the Saint Petersburg Dam has been under construction since 1979.[20]

Since the 18th century the terrain in the city has been raised artificially,
at some places by more than 4 m (13 ft), making mergers of several islands,
and changing the hydrology of the city. Besides the Neva and its
distributaries, other important rivers of the federal subject of Saint
Petersburg are Sestra, Okhta and Izhora. The largest lake is Sestroretsky
Razliv in the north, followed by Lakhtinsky Razliv, Suzdal Lakes and other
smaller lakes.

Saint Petersburg's position on the latitude of ca. 60Â° N causes variation in
day length across seasons, ranging from 5:53 to 18:50. Twilight may last all
night in early summer, from mid-May to mid-July, the celebrated phenomenon
known as the white nights.

Snow, falling at the morning of May 14, 2008 at Srednyaya Rogatka (district in
the south of St. Petersburg)

Saint Petersburg experiences a humid continental climate of the cool summer
subtype (KÃ¶ppen: Dfb), due to the distinct moderating influence of the Baltic
Sea cyclons. With cool, humid and short summers and long, cold winters, the
city is just short of having a subarctic climate ((KÃ¶ppen: Dfc).

The average daily temperature in July is 22 Â°C (72 Â°F); summer maximum is
about 34 Â°C (93 Â°F), winter minimum is about â35 Â°C (â31 Â°F). The
record low temperature is â35.9 Â°C (â33 Â°F), recorded in 1883. The
average annual temperature is +5.4 Â°C (42 Â°F). The River Neva within the
city limits usually freezes up in November-December, break-up occurs in April.
From December to March there are 123 days average with snow cover, which
reaches the average of 24 cm (9 in) by February. The frost-free period in the
city lasts on average for about 135 days. The city has a climate slightly
warmer than its suburbs. Weather conditions are quite variable all year
round.[21]

Average annual precipitation varies across the city, averaging 600 mm (24 in)
per year and reaching maximum in late summer. Soil moisture is almost always
high because of lower evapotranspiration due to the cool climate. Air humidity
is 78% on average, while overcast is 165 days a year on average.

Population history of Saint Petersburg[23][24]

Saint Petersburg is the second largest city in Russia. The 2002 census
recorded a population of the federal subject of 4,661,219, or 3.21% of the
total population of Russia. The 2002 census recorded twenty-two ethnic groups
of more than two thousand persons each. The ethnic composition was: Russian
84.72%, Ukrainian 1.87%, Belarusians 1.17%, Jewish 0.78%, Tatar 0.76%,
Armenian 0.41%, Azeri 0.36%, Georgian 0.22%, Chuvash 0.13%, Polish 0.10%, and
many other smaller ethnic groups, while 7.89% of the inhabitants declined to
state their ethnicity.[25]

The 20th century saw hectic ups and downs in population. From 2.4 million in
1916 it had dropped to less than 740,000 by 1920 during the Russian Revolution
of 1917 and Russian Civil War. The sizeable minorities of Germans, Poles,
Finns, Estonians and Latvians were almost completely expelled from Leningrad
by the Soviet government during the 1930s.[13] From 1941 to the end of 1943,
population dropped from 3 million to less than 700,000, as people died in
battles, starved to death during the Siege of Leningrad, or were evacuated.
After the siege, some of the evacuees returned, but most influx was due to
migration from other parts of the Soviet Union. The city absorbed about 3
million people in the 1950s and grew to over 5 million in the 1980s. From 1991
to 2006 the city's population decreased to the current 4.6 million, while the
suburban population increased due to privatization of land and massive move to
suburbs.[23][26] The birth rate remains lower than the death rate; people over
65 constitute more than twenty percent of the population; and the median age
is about 40 years.[27]

People in urban Saint Petersburg live mostly in apartments. Between 1918 and
the 1990s, the Soviets nationalised housing and forced residents to share
communal apartments (kommunalkas). With 68% living in shared flats in the
1930s, Leningrad was the city in the USSR with the largest number of
kommunalkas. Resettling residents of kommunalkas is now on the way out, albeit
shared apartments are still not uncommon. As new boroughs were built on the
outskirts in the 1950s-1980s, over half a million low income families
eventually received free apartments, and about an additional hundred thousand
condos were purchased. While economic and social activity is concentrated in
the historic city centre, the richest part of Saint Petersburg, most people
live in commuter areas. For the first half of 2007, the birth rate was 9.1 per
1000.[28]

Smolny Institute, the seat of the governor.

Saint Petersburg is a federal subject of Russia.[29] The political life of
Saint Petersburg is regulated by the city charter adopted by the city
legislature in 1998.[30] The superior executive body is the Saint Petersburg
City Administration, led by the governor (mayor before 1996). Saint Petersburg
has a single-chamber legislature, the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly.

According to the federal law passed in 2004, heads of federal subjects,
including the governor of Saint Petersburg, are nominated by the President of
Russia and approved by local legislatures. If the legislature disapproves the
nominee, it is dissolved. The current governor, Valentina Matviyenko, was
approved according to the new system in December 2006. She is currently the
only woman governor in the whole of Russia.

Saint Petersburg city is currently divided into eighteen districts. Saint
Petersburg is also the administrative centre of Leningrad Oblast, and of the
Northwestern Federal District.[31] The Constitutional Court of Russia moved to
Saint Petersburg from Moscow in May 2008.

Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast, being two different federal subjects,
share a number of local departments of federal executive agencies and courts,
such as court of arbitration, police, FSB, postal service, drug enforcement
administration, penitentiary service, federal registration service, and other
federal services.

The Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange, or Bourse, houses the Central Naval
Museum

Saint Petersburg is a major trade gateway, financial and industrial centre of
Russia specialising in oil and gas trade, shipbuilding yards, aerospace
industry, radio and electronics, software and computers; machine building,
heavy machinery and transport, including tanks and other military equipment,
mining, instrument manufacture, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy (production
of aluminium alloys), chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment,
publishing and printing, food and catering, wholesale and retail, textile and
apparel industries, and many other businesses. It was also home to Lessner,
one of Russia's two pioneering automobile manufacturers (along with Russo-
Baltic), Lessner; founded by machine tool and boiler maker G. A. Lessner in
1904, with designs by Boris Loutsky, it survived until 1910.[32]

10% of the world's power turbines are made there at the LMZ, which built over
two thousand turbines for power plants across the world. Major local
industries are Admiralty Shipyard, Baltic Shipyard, LOMO, Kirov Plant,
Elektrosila, Izhorsky Zavod; also registered in Saint Petersburg are
Sovkomflot, Petersburg Fuel Company and SIBUR among other major Russian and
international companies.

The Saint Petersburg docks at dawn.

Saint Petersburg has three large cargo seaports: Bolshoi Port Saint
Petersburg, Kronstadt, and Lomonosov. International cruise liners have been
served at the passenger port at Morskoy Vokzal on the south-west of Vasilevsky
Island. In 2008 the first two berths were opened at the New Passenger Port on
the west of the island.[33] The new port is part of the city's "Marine Facade"
development project[34] and is due to have seven berths in operation by 2010.

A complex system of riverports on both banks of the Neva river are
interconnected with the system of seaports, thus making Saint Petersburg the
main link between the Baltic sea and the rest of Russia through the Volga-
Baltic Waterway.

The Saint Petersburg Mint (Monetny Dvor), founded in 1724, is one of the
largest mints in the world, it mints Russian coins, medals and badges. Saint
Petersburg is also home to the oldest and largest Russian foundry,
Monumentskulptura, which made thousands of sculptures and statues that are now
gracing public parks of Saint Petersburg, as well as many other cities.
Monuments and bronze statues of the Tsars, as well as other important historic
figures and dignitaries, and other world famous monuments, such as the
sculptures by Peter Clodt von JÃ¼rgensburg, Paolo Troubetzkoy, Pavel
Antokolsky, and others, were made there.

In 2007 Toyota opened a Camry plant after investing 5 billion dollars in
Shushary, one of the southern suburbs of Saint Petersburg. General Motors,
Hyundai and Nissan have signed deals with the Russian government to build
their automotive plants in Saint Petersburg too. Automotive and auto-parts
industry is on the rise there during the last decade. Saint Petersburg is also
known as the "beer capital" of Russia, due to the supply and quality of local
water, contributing over 30% of the domestic production of beer with its five
large-scale breweries including Europe's second largest brewery Baltika, Vena
(both operated by BBH), Heineken Brewery, Stepan Razin (both by Heineken) and
Tinkoff brewery (SUN-InBev). Saint Petersburg has the second largest
construction industry in Russia, including commercial, housing and road
construction.

In 2006 Saint Petersburg's city budget was 179,9 billion rubles,[35] and is
planned to double by 2012. The federal subject's gross regional product as of
2005 was 667,905.4 million Russian rubles, ranked 4th in Russia, after Moscow,
Tyumen Oblast, and Moscow Oblast,[36] or 145,503.3 rubles per capita, ranked
12th among Russia's federal subjects,[37] contributed mostly by wholesale and
retail trade and repair services (24.7%) as well as processing industry
(20.9%) and transportation and telecommunications (15.1%).[38]

## Crime

See also: Crime in Russia

<IMG>

<IMG>

The Kresty prison.

Russia historically had a high level of crime that increased significantly
after the October revolution.[39] Perestroika-time turmoils saw additional
increase of the crime level.

Saint Petersburg experiences significant levels of street crime and bribery.
In addition, in recent years there has been a notable increase in racially
motivated violence, especially towards tourists and foreign students.[40] One
of the well known white supremacist groups Belaya Energia (White Energy,
originally comes from White Power), has reportedly been one of the main gangs
involved in murdering foreign university students.[41]

At the end of the 1980s â beginning of the 1990s, Leningrad became home to a
number of organised criminal groups as Tambov Gang, Malyshev Gang, Kazan Gang
and ethnic criminal groups, engaged in a racket, extortion, paying off local
government, and violent clashes with each other.[42]

After the assassinations of City Property Committee Chairman and vice-Governor
Mikhail Manevich(1997), State Duma deputy Galina Starovoytova (1998), acting
City Legislature Speaker Viktor Novosyolov (1999) and a number of prominent
businesspeople, Saint Petersburg was dubbed Capital of Crime in the Russian
press.[43][44] There were a number of movies filmed in Saint Petersburg about
the life of crime; Banditskiy Peterburg: Advocat,[45] Brother (1997)[46]
reinforcing its image as the Crime Capital of Russia.

One of the oldest and most infamous remand facilities in Saint Petersburg,
Kresty prison is located near downtown.

However, crime rates in St. Petersburg have declined since the ending of the
1990s; the aforementioned criminal gangs have mostly dispersed. Even the
Kresty prison is no longer in use, as more modern penal institutions are being
built farther from the city centre. With levels of organised crime
significantly lowered, the main concern now (as in most major cities) is
street crime; however, the number of capital offenses in St. Petersburg is
unusually low for Russia, and for Eastern Europe as well.[citation needed]

## Transportation

<IMG>

<IMG>

The decoration of Saint Petersburg Metro (Kirovsky Zavod Station).

Saint Petersburg is a major transport hub. The first Russian railway was built
here, in 1837. Today, the city is the final destination of a web of intercity
and suburban railways, served by five different railway terminals (Baltiysky,
Finlyandsky, Ladozhsky, Moskovsky, and Vitebsky),[47] as well as dozens of
non-terminal railway stations within the federal subject. Saint Petersburg has
international railway connections to Helsinki, Finland, Berlin, Germany, and
all former republics of the USSR. The Helsinki railway was built in 1870, 443
km (275 mi), commutes three times a day, in a journey lasting about five and a
half hours. The Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway opened in 1851, 651 km (405
mi); the commute to Moscow now requires about four and a half to nine
hours.[48] Saint Petersburg is also served by Pulkovo International
Airport,[49] and by three smaller commercial and cargo airports in the
suburbs. There is a regular, 24/7, rapid-bus transit connection between
Pulkovo airport and the city centre.

The city is also served by the passenger and cargo seaports in the Neva Bay of
the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, the river port higher up the Neva, and tens
of smaller passenger stations on both banks of the Neva river. It is a
terminus of the Volga-Baltic and White Sea-Baltic waterways. In 2004 the first
high bridge that doesn't need to be drawn, a 2,824 m (9,265 ft) long Big
Obukhovsky Bridge, was opened. Meteor hydrofoils link the city centre to the
coastal towns of Kronstadt, Lomonosov, Peterhof, Sestroretsk and Zelenogorsk
from May through October.

<IMG>

<IMG>

Pulkovo International Airport.

Saint Petersburg has an extensive city-funded network of public transport
(buses, trams, trolleybuses) and several hundred routes served by marshrutkas.
Trams in Saint Petersburg used to be the main transport; in the 1980s,
Leningrad had the largest tramway network in the world, but many tramway rail
tracks were dismantled in the 2000s. Buses carry up to 3 million passengers
daily, serving over 250 urban and a number of suburban bus routes. Saint
Petersburg Metro underground rapid transit system was opened in 1955; it now
has five lines with 63 stations, connecting all five railway terminals, and
carrying 3.4 million passengers daily. Metro stations are decorated in marble
and bronze.

Traffic jams are common in the city, because of high daily traffic volumes
between the commuter boroughs and the city centre, intercity traffic, and at
times excessive snow in winter. Five segments of the Saint Petersburg Ring
Road were opened between 2002 and 2006, and full ring is planned to open in
2010.

Saint Petersburg is part of the important transport corridor linking
Scandinavia to Russia and Eastern Europe. The city is a node of the
international European routes E18 towards Helsinki, E20 towards Tallinn, E95
towards Pskov, Kiev and Odessa and E105 towards Petrozavodsk, Murmansk and
Kirkenes (north) and towards Moscow and Kharkiv (south).

As of now, Saint Petersburg has no skyscrapers and a relatively low skyline.
Current regulations forbid construction of high buildings in the city centre.
The 310 metre tall Saint Petersburg TV Tower is the tallest structure in the
city, while the 122.5 m Peter and Paul Cathedral is by far the highest
building. However, there is a controversial project endorsed by the city
authorities and known as the Ohkta Centre to build a 396 m supertall
skyscraper. In 2008 the World Monuments Fund included the Saint Petersburg
historic skyline within the watch list of 100 most endangered sites due to the
expected construction, which threatens to alter it drastically.[50]

Unlike in Moscow, in Saint Petersburg the historic architecture of the city
centre, mostly consisting of Baroque and neoclassical buildings of the 18th
and 19th centuries, has been largely preserved, although a number of buildings
were demolished after the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, during the Siege of
Leningrad and in recent years. The oldest of the remaining building is a
wooden house built for Peter I in 1703 on the shore of the Neva near Trinity
Square. Since 1991 the Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups
of Monuments in Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast have been listed by
UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

The ensemble of Peter and Paul Fortress with the Peter and Paul Cathedral
takes dominant position on Zayachy Island along the right bank of the River
Neva. Each noon a cannon fires a blank shot from the fortress. The Saint
Petersburg Mosque, the largest mosque in Europe when opened in 1913, is
situated on the right bank nearby. The spit of Vasilievsky Island, which
splits the river into two largest armlets, the Bolshaya Neva and Malaya Neva,
is connected to the northern bank (Petrogradsky Island) via the Exchange
Bridge and occupied by the Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange and Rostral
Columns. The southern coast of Vasilievsky Island along the Bolshaya Neva
features some of the city's oldest buildings, dating from the 18th century,
including the Kunstkamera, Twelve Collegia, Menshikov Palace and Imperial
Academy of Arts. It hosts one of two campuses of Saint Petersburg State
University.

On the southern, left bank of the Neva, connected to the spit of Vasilievsky
Island via the Palace Bridge, lie the Admiralty Building, the vast Hermitage
Museum complex stretching along the Palace Embankment, which includes the
baroque Winter Palace, former official residence of Russian emperors, as well
as the neoclassical Marble Palace. The Winter Palace faces Palace Square, the
city's main square with the Alexander Column.

Nevsky Prospekt, also situated on the left bank of the Neva, is the main
avenue in the city. It starts at the Admiralty and runs eastwards next to
Palace Square. Nevsky Prospekt crosses the Moika (Green Bridge), Griboyedov
Canal (Kazansky Bridge), Garden Street, the Fontanka (Anichkov Bridge), meets
Liteyny Prospekt and proceeds to Uprising Square near the Moskovsky railway
station, where it meets Ligovsky Prospekt and turns to the Alexander Nevsky
Lavra. The Passage, Catholic Church of St. Catherine, Book House (former
Singer Manufacturing Company Building in the Art Nouveau style), Grand Hotel
Europe, Gostiny Dvor, Russian National Library, Alexandrine Theatre behind
Mikeshin's statue of Catherine the Great, Kazan Cathedral, Anichkov Palace and
Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace are all situated along that avenue.

The Alexander Nevsky Lavra, intended to house the relics of St. Alexander
Nevsky, is an important centre of Christian education in Russia. It also
contains the Tikhvin Cemetery with graves of many notable Petersburgers.

On the territory between the Neva and Nevsky Prospekt the Church of the Savior
on Blood, Mikhailovsky Palace housing the Russian Museum, Field of Mars, St.
Michael's Castle, Summer Garden, Tauride Palace, Smolny Institute and Smolny
Convent are located.

Many notable landmarks are situated to the west and south of the Admiralty
Building, including the Trinity Cathedral, Mariinsky Palace, Hotel Astoria,
famous Mariinsky Theatre, New Holland Island, Saint Isaac's Cathedral, the
largest in the city, and Decembrists Square with the Bronze Horseman, 18th
century equestrian monument to Peter the Great, which is considered among the
city's most recognisable symbols.

Other symbols of Saint Petersburg include the weather vane in the shape of a
small ship on top of the Admiralty's golden spire and the golden angel on top
of the Peter and Paul Cathedral. The Palace Bridge drawn at night is yet
another symbol of the city. Every night during the navigation period from
April to November, 22 bridges across the Neva and main canals are drawn to let
ships pass in and out of the Baltic Sea according to a schedule.[51] It wasn't
until 2004 that the first high bridge across the Neva, which doesn't need to
be drawn, Big Obukhovsky Bridge, was opened. There are hundreds of smaller
bridges in Saint Petersburg spanning across numerous canals and distributaries
of the Neva, some of the most important of which are the Moika, Fontanka,
Griboyedov Canal, Obvodny Canal, Karpovka and Smolenka. Due to the intricate
web of canals, Saint Petersburg is often called Venice of the North. The
rivers and canals in the city centre are lined with granite embankments. The
embankments and bridges are separated from rivers and canals by granite or
cast iron parapets.

Southern suburbs of the city feature former imperial residences, including
Peterhof, with majestic fountain cascades and parks, Tsarskoe Selo, with the
baroque Catherine Palace and the neoclassical Alexander Palace, and Pavlovsk,
which contains a domed palace of Emperor Paul and one of the largest English-
style parks in Europe. Some other residences situated nearby and making part
of the world heritage site, including a castle and park in Gatchina, actually
belong to Leningrad Oblast rather than Saint Petersburg. Another notable
suburb is Kronstadt with its 19th century fortifications and naval monuments,
occupying the Kotlin Island in the Gulf of Finland.

### Museums

<IMG>

<IMG>

Interior of the Hermitage Museum.

Saint Petersburg is home to more than two hundred museums, many of them hosted
in historic buildings. The largest of the museums is the Hermitage Museum,
featuring interiors of the former imperial residence and a vast collection of
art. The Russian Museum is a large museum devoted to the Russian fine art
specifically. The apartments of some famous Petersburgers, including Alexander
Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Feodor Chaliapin,
Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Anna Akhmatova, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Joseph
Brodsky, as well as some palace and park ensembles of the southern suburbs and
notable architectural monuments such as St. Isaac's Cathedral, have also been
turned into public museums. The Kunstkamera, with its collection established
in 1714 by Peter the Great to collect curiosities from all over the world, is
sometimes considered the first museum in Russia, which has evolved into the
present-day Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography. The
Russian Ethnography Museum, which has been split from the Russian Museum, is
devoted to the cultures of the people of Russia, the former Soviet Union and
Russian Empire. Other notable museums include the Central Naval Museum hosted
in the building of the former stock exchange and Zoological Museum, the
Railway Museum, Museum of the Siege of Leningrad, Museum of the History of
Saint Petersburg in the Peter and Paul Fortress and Artillery Museum, which in
fact includes not only artillery items, but also a huge collection of other
military equipment, uniform and decorations.

### Parks

<IMG>

<IMG>

The Grand Cascade.

Saint Petersburg is home to numerous parks and gardens, some of the most
famous of which are situated in the southern suburbs, including one of the
largest English gardens of Europe in Pavlovsk. Sosnovka is the largest park
within the limits of the city proper, occupying 240 ha. The Summer Garden is
the oldest one, dating back to the early 18th century and designed in the
regular style. It is situated on the southern bank of the Neva at the head of
the Fontanka and is famous for its cast iron railing and marble sculptures.
Among other notable parks are the Maritime Victory Park on Krestovsky Island
and the Moscow Victory Park in the south, both commemorating the victory over
Nazi Germany in the Second World War, as well as the Central Park of Culture
and Leisure occupying Yelagin Island and the Tauride Garden around the Tauride
Palace. The most common trees grown in the parks are the English oak, Norway
maple, green ash, silver birch, Siberian larch, blue spruce, crack willow,
limes and poplars. Important dendrological collections dating back to the 19th
century are hosted by the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden and the Park of
the Forestry Academy.

## Culture

Main article: Society and culture in Saint Petersburg

### Music

Among the city's more than fifty theaters is the world-famous Mariinsky
Theater (also known as the Kirov Theater in the USSR ), home to the Mariinsky
Ballet company and opera. Leading ballet dancers, such as Vaslav Nijinsky,
Anna Pavlova, Rudolph Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Galina Ulanova and Natalia
Makarova, were principal stars of the Mariinsky ballet.

Dmitri Shostakovich was born and brought up in Saint Petersburg, and dedicated
his Seventh Symphony to the city, calling it the "Leningrad Symphony." He
wrote the symphony while in Leningrad during the Nazi siege. The 7th symphony
was premiered in 1942; its performance in the besieged Leningrad at the
Bolshoy Philharmonic Hall under the baton of conductor Karl Eliasberg was
heard over the radio and lifted the spirits of the survivors.[52] In 1992 a
reunion performance of the 7th Symphony by the (then) 14 survivors was played
in the same hall as they done half a century ago.[53] The Leningrad
Philharmonic Orchestra remained one of the best known symphony orchestras in
the world under the leadership of conductors Yevgeny Mravinsky and Yuri
Temirkanov.

The Imperial Choral Capella was founded and modeled after the royal courts of
other European capitals.

Saint Petersburg has been home to the newest movements in popular music in the
country. The first jazz band in the Soviet Union was founded here by Leonid
Utyosov in the 1920s, under the patronage of Isaak Dunayevsky. The first jazz
club in the Soviet Union was founded here in the 1950s, and later was named
jazz club Kvadrat. In 1956 the popular ensemble Druzhba was founded by
Aleksandr Bronevitsky and Edita Piekha, becoming the first popular band in the
1950s USSR. In the 1960s student rock-groups Argonavty, Kochevniki and others
pioneered a series of unofficial and underground rock concerts and festivals.
In 1972 Boris Grebenshchikov founded the band Aquarium, that later grew to
huge popularity. Since then "Peter's rock" music style was formed.

In the 1970s many bands came out from "underground" and eventually founded the
Leningrad rock club which has been providing stage to such bands as Piknik,
DDT, Kino, headed by the legendary Viktor Tsoi, Igry, Mify, Zemlyane, Alisa
and many other popular groups. The first Russian-style happening show Pop
mekhanika, mixing over 300 people and animals on stage, was directed by the
multi-talented Sergey Kuryokhin in the 1980s.

Today's Saint Petersburg boasts many notable musicians of various genres, from
popular Leningrad's Sergei Shnurov and Tequilajazzz, to rock veterans Yuri
Shevchuk, Vyacheslav Butusov and Mikhail Boyarsky.

The White Nights Festival in Saint Petersburg is famous for spectacular
fireworks and massive show celebrating the end of school year.

### Film

Over 250 international and Russian movies were filmed in Saint Petersburg.[54]
Well over a thousand feature films about tsars, revolution, people and stories
set in Saint Petersburg were produced worldwide, but were not filmed in the
city. First film studios were founded in Saint Petersburg in the 1900s, and
since the 1920s Lenfilm has been the largest film studio based in Saint
Petersburg. The first foreign feature movie filmed entirely in Saint
Petersburg was the 1997 production of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, starring Sophie
Marceau and Sean Bean, and made by international team of British, American,
French and Russian filmmakers.

The cult comedy Irony of Fate (also ÐÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¸Ñ ÑÑÐ´ÑÐ±Ñ, Ð¸Ð»Ð¸ Ð¡
Ð»ÑÐ³ÐºÐ¸Ð¼ Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ¾Ð¼!) is set in Saint Petersburg and pokes fun at Soviet
city planning. The 1985 film White Nights received considerable Western
attention for having captured genuine Leningrad street scenes at a time when
filming in the Soviet Union by Western production companies was generally
unheard of. Other movies include GoldenEye (1995), Midnight in Saint
Petersburg (1996), and Brother (1997). Onegin (1999) is based on the Pushkin
poem and showcases many tourist attractions. Several international film
festivals are held annually, such as the International Film Festival in Saint
Petersburg, since its inauguration in 1993 during the White Nights.[citation
needed]

### Literature

Saint Petersburg has a longstanding and world famous tradition in literature.
Dostoyevsky called it âThe most abstract and intentional city in the world,"
emphasizing its artificiality, but it was also a symbol of modern disorder in
a changing Russia. It frequently appeared to Russian writers as a menacing and
inhuman mechanism. The grotesque and often nightmarish image of the city is
featured in Pushkin's last poems, the Petersburg stories of Gogol, the novels
of Dostoyevsky, the verse of Alexander Blok and Osip Mandelshtam, and in the
symbolist novel Petersburg by Andrey Bely. According to Lotman in his chapter,
'The Symbolism of Saint Petersburg' in Universe and the Mind, these writers
were inspired from symbolism from within the city itself. The effect of life
in Saint Petersburg on the plight of the poor clerk in a society obsessed with
hierarchy and status also became an important theme for authors such as
Pushkin, Gogol, and Dostoyevsky. Another important feature of early Saint
Petersburg literature is its mythical element, which incorporates urban
legends and popular ghost stories, as the stories of Pushkin and Gogol
included ghosts returning to Saint Petersburg to haunt other characters as
well as other fantastical elements, creating a surreal and abstract image of
Saint Petersburg.

Twentieth century writers from Saint Petersburg, such as Vladimir Nabokov,
Andrey Bely and Yevgeny Zamyatin, along with his apprentices, The Serapion
Brothers, created entire new styles in literature and contributed new insights
to the understanding of society through their experience in this city. Anna
Akhmatova became an important leader for Russian poetry. Her poem Requiem
focuses on the tragedies of living during the time of the Stalinist terror.
Another notable 20th century writer from Saint Petersburg is Joseph Brodsky,
recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature (1987). While living in the United
States, his writings in English reflected on life in Saint Petersburg from the
unique perspective of being both an insider and an outsider to the city in
essays such as, "A Guide to a Renamed City" and the nostalgic "In a Room and a
Half".[55]

### Sports

FC Zenit's home Petrovsky stadium

Saint Petersburg hosted part of the football tournament during the 1980 Summer
Olympics. The 1994 Goodwill Games were held here.

The first competition here was the 1703 rowing event initiated by Peter the
Great, after the victory over the Swedish fleet. Yachting events were held by
the Russian Navy since the foundation of the city. Equestrianism has been a
long tradition, popular among the Tsars and aristocracy, as well as part of
the military training. Several historic sports arenas were built for
Equestrianism since the 18th century, to maintain training all year round,
such as the Zimny Stadion and Konnogvardeisky Manezh among others.

Chess tradition was highlighted by the 1914 international tournament, in which
the title "Grandmaster" was first formally conferred by Russian Tsar Nicholas
II to five players: Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch and Marshall, and
which the Tsar had partially funded.

Kirov Stadium (now demolished) was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the
world, and the home to FC Zenit St. Petersburg in 1950-1993 and 1995. In 1951
the attendance of 110,000 set the record for the Soviet football. In 2007
Zenit became champions of the Russian Premier League, won the UEFA Cup
2007â08 season and the 2008 UEFA Supercup. Zenit now plays their home games
at Petrovsky Stadium
