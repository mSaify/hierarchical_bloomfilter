Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the
BBC. As of 11 April 2009, 753 individual episodes, including one television
movie of Doctor Who have been aired, encompassing 204 stories. Additionally,
four charity specials and one animated serial have been aired, and two short
sequences, "A Fix with Sontarans" and "Attack of the Graske", were produced
and involved the interaction of a viewer - the former was a segment of Jim'll
Fix It, while the latter was a fully interactive adventure. The show's high
episode count resulted in Doctor Who holding the world record for the highest
number of episodes for a science-fiction programme.[1] For comparison, the
record holder for the highest number of consecutive episodes, Stargate
SG-1,[1] aired 214 episodes.

Each serial up to 1989's Survival, with the exception of one cutaway and one
special, was a multi-episode story; the characters in the column after the
serial titles indicate the code used by the production team to designate the
serial (where applicable) and are followed either by the titles of the
individual episodes where given or by the number of episodes otherwise. Unless
otherwise noted, episodes in this period are 25 minutes long.

Starting with the 2005 revival, the production team abandoned the traditional
serial format for a largely self-contained episodic format with occasional
multi-part story and loose story arcs, similar to the style of American dramas
such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The X-Files. Unless otherwise noted, the
new episodes are 45 minutes long.

Additionally, some other subsets of serials and episodes exist. Some are
unmade: they were proposed for a variety of reasons, some reaching post-
production, but not broadcast. Some episodes from the 1960s are missing due to
the BBC's previous junking policy, and thus their serials are incomplete.
Also, in the first two seasons and most of the third, each episode of a serial
had an individual title; no serial had an overall onscreen title until The
Savages. The serial titles given below are the most common title for the
serials as a whole, used in sources such as the Doctor Who Reference Guide and
the BBC's classic episode guide, and are generally those used for commercial
release. The practice of individually titled episodes resurfaced with the
show's 2005 revival, when Doctor Who's serial nature was abandoned in favour
of an episodic format.

The three-digit story numbers are not official designations but are merely to
serve as a guide to where the story stands in the overall context of the
programme. There is some dispute about, for example, whether to count Season
23's The Trial of a Time Lord as one or four serials,[2] and whether the
uncompleted Shada should be included.[3] The numbering scheme used here
reflects that used in sources such as The Discontinuity Guide, Outpost
Gallifrey and DVD releases.

During the early seasons of the programme most serials are linked together,
one usually leading directly into the next â although there are some breaks,
such as between the second season finale, The Time Meddler, and the third
season premiere, Galaxy 4.

## First Doctor

The first televised incarnation of The Doctor was portrayed by William
Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the Doctor visited a mixture of both
stories set in the future and historical events that had no extraterrestrial
influence, such as fifteenth century Mesoamerica. In his last story, The Tenth
Planet, the First Doctor gradually grew weaker until collapsing and
regenerating at the end of episode four.

### Season 1 (1963-64)

Verity Lambert was producer for the first season, and retained the position
until "Mission to the Unknown". David Whitaker served as script editor until
The Dalek Invasion of Earth.

The Fourth Doctor was portrayed by Tom Baker, and is to date the longest-
serving Doctor[4], having held the role for seven seasons.

### Season 12 (1974-75)

Barry Letts served as producer for Robot, after which he was succeeded by
Philip Hinchcliffe. Robert Holmes served as script editor. Both Hinchcliffe
and Holmes would retain these roles until the start of season 15. All serials
in this season continue directly one after the other, tracing one single
problematic voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is
considered its own standalone story.

whole season is titled as The Trial of a Time Lord, and is split into four

## Eighth Doctor

The Eighth Doctor was portrayed by Paul McGann. The movie is the only
television appearance of this Doctor. The only production title held by this
story was Doctor Who. However, producer Philip Segal later suggested Enemy
Within as an alternative title. Lacking any other specific name, many fans
have adopted this to refer to the movie. Fan groups have also used other
informal titles. The DVD release is titled Doctor Who: The Movie.

## Ninth Doctor

In 2005, the BBC relaunched Doctor Who after a 16-year absence from episodic
television, with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young as executive
producers, Phil Collinson as producer, and Christopher Eccleston taking the
lead role of the Ninth Doctor.

Although the production team chose to restart the series numbering from
scratch, some fans of the programme prefer to refer to the 2005 series as
Season 27, the 2006 series as Season 28, and so on. Despite the new numbering,
the revival adheres to the original continuity. The new series is formatted to
a 16:9 widescreen display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes.
For the first time since the 1965â'66 season, each episode has an individual
title even though some stories span several episodes.

### Series 1 (2005)

### Specials (2009-10)

There will be a total of four specials between "The Next Doctor" and the
beginning of the fifth series in 2010. The first of these, "Planet of the
Dead" (produced by Tracie Simpson, a former production manager[8]), was
broadcast in April and the remaining three are scheduled for later in the
year. They are the first episodes of Doctor Who to be filmed using HD.[9] For
practical reasons, these specials continue to use Series 4 production codes.

The second special, "The Waters of Mars", is produced by Nikki Wilson
(producer of The Sarah Jane Adventures) and features Lindsay Duncan as
Adelaide, described by the BBC as "the Doctor's cleverest and most strong-
minded companion yet."[10] It was originally reported to be scheduled around
Christmas 2009[11], but the current plan is for it to air before the Christmas
period.[12] Russell T Davies expects the special to be broadcast in or around
November.[13][14]

The last two specials form a single two-part story[15], which is planned to be
scheduled over Christmas 2009[13] and, possibly, New Year 2010.[16] Russell T
Davies has confirmed that the companion for the final two specials will be
Bernard Cribbins, who will be reprising his recurring role of Wilfred
Mott.[13]

announcement that he will not be continuing.[23][24] For this fifth series,

executive producer.[25] Julie Gardner will be replaced as executive producer
by Piers Wenger,[26] who has already replaced Gardner as Head of Drama for BBC
Wales.[27]

## Other stories

### TV broadcasts

There have also been several special Doctor Who episodes and serials that are
produced by the BBC, but are not generally considered part of the series
continuity. They usually consist of spoofs and crossovers with other TV shows,
and stories produced for special occasions.

## Notes

  * ^a Webber's script for the originally intended opening episode for the first story The Giants was a basis for the opening episode, but Webber didn't work with Coburn on the script.
  * ^b From this point on, the stories (not the episodes) all have on-screen serial titles. For the 2005 revival, episode titles are used, even for most multi-episode tales, although the majority of stories are told in a single episode.
  * ^c The Three Doctors was a tenth anniversary serial.
  * ^d Between 1976 and 2008, Episode 3 existed only in black and white â for the Dalek War DVD box set release, the colour has been replaced using colourisation methods and the original colour information found within a black and white copy
  * ^e The first episode lists the serial's name as simply Invasion, in order to conceal the surprise ending to that episode.
  * ^f Shada was left unfinished due to a strike. Its recorded footage was later released on home video using linking narration by Tom Baker to complete the story. It is not included in the episode count due to the episode not being aired, but is included in the story count.
  * ^g The Five Doctors is considered part of the 20th season, although it was broadcast only a few weeks before the start of Season 21. The Five Doctors has also been released as four 25-minute episodes, and a 100 minute "Special Edition" re-edit, c. 2000. It is counted as 1 episode in the count.
  * ^h Resurrection of the Daleks was written and filmed as four 25-minute episodes, then re-edited into two 45-minute episodes to accommodate coverage of the 1984 Winter Olympics; the 25-minute versions were later circulated to overseas broadcasters and commercially released. It is counted as two episodes in the count.
  * ^i "TVM" is used in the BBC's online episode guide.[29] The actual code used during production is 50/LDX071Y/01X.[30] Doctor Who Magazine's "Complete Eighth Doctor Special" gives the production code as #83705.[31] Big Finish Productions uses the code 8A, and numbers its subsequent Eighth Doctor stories correspondingly.
  * ^j As filming progressed on Series 4, the producers decided to rearrange the order of some episodes. "The Fires of Pompeii" and "Planet of the Ood" were switched, and "Midnight" was moved to air after the "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead" two-parter. However, the episodes retained the production codes reflecting the earlier plans.[32]
