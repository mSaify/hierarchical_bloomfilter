Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction
that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions
between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of
certain drugs. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction; it is
a predictable consequence of excess serotonergic activity at central nervous
system (CNS) and peripheral serotonin receptors.[1] For this reason, some
experts strongly prefer the terms serotonin toxicity or serotonin toxidrome
because these more accurately reflect the fact that it is a form of
poisoning.[2][3] It may also be called serotonin storm, hyperserotonemia, or
serotonergic syndrome.

The excess serotonin activity produces a spectrum of specific symptoms
including cognitive, autonomic, and somatic effects. The symptoms may range
from barely perceptible to fatal.[1] Numerous drugs and drug combinations have
been reported to produce serotonin syndrome. Diagnosis of serotonin syndrome
includes observing the symptoms produced and a thorough investigation of the
patient's history. The syndrome has a characteristic picture but can be
mistaken for other illnesses in some patients, particularly those with
neuroleptic malignant syndrome. No laboratory tests can currently confirm the
diagnosis.[3]

Treatment consists of discontinuing medications which may contribute and in
moderate to severe cases administering a serotonin antagonist. An important
adjunct treatment includes controlling agitation with benzodiazepine sedation.
The high profile case of Libby Zion, who died from serotonin syndrome,[1]
resulted in changes to graduate medical education in New York State.[4]

## [edit] Signs and symptoms

Symptom onset is usually rapid, often occurring within minutes. Serotonin
syndrome encompasses a wide range of clinical findings. Mild symptoms may only
consist of increased heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated pupils,
myoclonus (intermittent tremor or twitching), as well as overresponsive
reflexes.[1] Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as
hyperactive bowel sounds, high blood pressure and hyperthermia; a temperature
as high as 40 Â°C (104 Â°F) is common in moderate intoxication. The overactive
reflexes and clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than
in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hypervigilance and
agitation.[1] Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood
pressure that may lead to shock. Severe cases often have agitated delirium as
well as muscular rigidity and high muscular tension. Temperature may rise to
above 41.1 Â°C (106.0 Â°F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities
include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, renal failure, and
disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a
consequence of hyperthermia.[1][3]

The symptoms are often described as a clinical triad of abnormalities:[1][5]

  * Cognitive effects: mental confusion, hypomania, hallucinations, agitation, headache, coma.
  * Autonomic effects: shivering, sweating, hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, diarrhea.
  * Somatic effects: myoclonus (muscle twitching), hyperreflexia (manifested by clonus), tremor.

## [edit] Pathophysiology

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in multiple states including
aggression, pain, sleep, appetite, anxiety, depression, migraine, and
vomiting.[5] In humans the effects of serotonin excess were first noted in
1960 in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and
tryptophan.[6] The syndrome is caused by increased serotonin in the central
nervous system.[1] It was originally suspected that agonism of 5-HT1A
receptors in central grey nuclei and the medulla was responsible for the
development of the syndrome.[7] Further study has determined that
overstimulation of primarily the 5-HT2A receptors appears to contribute
substantially to the condition.[7] The 5-HT1A receptor may still contribute
through a pharmacodynamic interaction in which increased synaptic
concentrations of a serotonin agonist saturate all receptor subtypes.[1]
Additionally, noradrenergic CNS hyperactivity may play a role as CNS
norepinephrine concentrations are increased in serotonin syndrome and levels
appear to correlate with the clinical outcome. Other neurotransmitters may
also play a role; NMDA receptor antagonists and GABA have been suggested as
affecting the development of the syndrome.[1] Serotonin toxicity is more
pronounced following supra-therapeutic doses and overdoses, and they merge in
a continuum with the toxic effects of overdose.[8][9]

### [edit] Drugs which may contribute

A large number of drugs and drug combinations have been reported to produce
serotonin syndrome.

Class Drugs  
Antidepressants Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),[1] TCAs,[1] SSRIs,[1]
SNRIs,[1] bupropion,[10] nefazodone,[11] trazodone[11]  
Opioids tramadol,[1] pethidine,[1] fentanyl,[1] pentazocine,[1]
buprenorphine[12] oxycodone,[13] hydrocodone[13]  
CNS stimulants phentermine,[14] diethylpropion,[14] amphetamines,[3][14]
sibutramine,[1] methylphenidate,[14] methamphetamine,[14] cocaine[14]  
5-HT1 agonists triptans[1][14]  
Psychedelics MDMA,[1] MDA,[1] 5-Methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine,[1] LSD[15][16]  
Herbs St John's Wort,[1] Syrian rue,[1] Panax ginseng,[1] Nutmeg[17]  
Others tryptophan,[1] L-Dopa,[18] valproate,[1] buspirone,[1] lithium,[1]
linezolid,[1] dextromethorphan,[1] 5-hydroxytryptophan,[11]
chlorpheniramine,[14] risperidone,[19] olanzapine,[20] ondansetron,[1]
granisetron,[1] metoclopramide,[1] ritonavir[1]  
Many cases of serotonin toxicity occur in patients who have ingested drug
combinations that synergistically increase synaptic serotonin.[5] It may also
occur in patients following ingestion of a single serotonergic agent.[21] The
combination of MAOIs and other serotonin agonists or precursors pose a
particularly severe risk of a life-threatening serotonin syndrome.[22] Many
MAOIs inhibit monoamine oxidase irreversibly, so that the enzyme cannot
function until it has been replaced by the body, which can take at least four
weeks.[23]

Many medications may have been incorrectly thought to cause serotonin
syndrome. For example, some case reports have implicated atypical
antipsychotics in serotonin syndrome, but it appears based on their
pharmacology that they are unlikely to cause the syndrome.[24] It has also
been suggested that mirtazapine has no significant serotonergic
effects,[dubious â discuss] and is therefore not a dual action drug.[25] In
2006 the US FDA issued an alert suggesting that the combined use of SSRIs or
SNRIs and triptan medications or sibutramine could potentially lead to severe
cases of serotonin syndrome.[26] This has been disputed by other researchers
as none of the cases reported by the FDA met the Hunter criteria for serotonin
syndrome.[26][27] The condition has however occurred in surprising clinical
situations, and because of phenotypic variations among individuals, it has
been associated with unexpected drugs, including mirtazapine.[28][29]

### [edit] Spectrum concept

A postulated âspectrum conceptâ of serotonin toxicity emphasises the role
that progressively increasing serotonin levels play in mediating the clinical
picture as side effects merge into toxicity. The dose-effect relationship is
the term used to describe the effects of progressive elevation of serotonin,
either by raising the dose of one drug, or combining it with another
serotonergic drug which may produce large elevations in serotonin levels.[30]

## [edit] Risk and severity

The relative risk and severity of serotonergic side effects and serotonin
toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin
syndrome has been reported in in patients of all ages, including the elderly,
children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure.[31][32][33][34]
The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose
it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy
adults.[8][35] Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically
only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of
action are mixed together.[3] Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have
clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, e.g.
tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA are associated with severe cases of the
syndrome.[1][36]

## [edit] Diagnosis

There is no laboratory test for serotonin syndrome, therefore diagnosis is by
symptom observation and investigation of the patient's history.[1] Several
diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first criteria that was rigorously
evaluated was introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a professor of
psychiatry at UCLA.[1][23][37] Researchers in Australia have later developed
the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria, which has better sensitivity and
specificity, 84% and respectively 97%.[5][1] As of 2007, Sternbach's criteria
were still the most commonly used.[3]

The most important symptoms for diagnosing serotonin syndrome are tremor,
akathisia, or clonus (spontaneous, inducible and ocular).[5] Physical
examination of the patient should include assessment of deep-tendon reflexes
and muscle rigidity, the dryness of the oral mucosa, the size and reactivity
of the pupils, the intensity of bowel sounds, skin color, and the presence or
absence of sweating.[1] The patient's history also plays an important role in
diagnosis, investigations should include enquries about the use of
prescription and over-the-counter drugs, illicit substances, and dietary
supplements, as all these agents have been implicated in the development of
serotonin syndrome.[1] The Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria suggests
serotonin syndrome if the patient has taken a serotonergic agent and has
symptoms of:[5]

  * Spontaneous clonus, or
  * Inducible clonus or ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis, or
  * Tremor and hyperreflexia, or
  * Hypertonism and temperature > 38 Â°C (100 Â°F) and ocular clonus or inducible clonus

### [edit] Differential diagnosis

Serotonin toxicity has a characteristic picture which is generally hard to
confuse with other medical conditions, but in some situations it may go
unrecognized because it may be mistaken for a viral illness, anxiety,
neurological disorder, anticholinergic poisoning, sympathomimetic toxicity, or
worsening psychiatric condition.[3][1][38] The condition most often confused
with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).[39] The
clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome
share some features which can make differentiating them difficult.[40] In both
conditions, autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop.[7]
However, they are actually very different conditions with different underlying
dysfunction (serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade). Both the time course and
the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin
toxicity.[5] Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of
a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like
chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine. Dopamine receptor blockade (NMS) has a slow
onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a
neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as
bromocriptine.[1][7]

Differential diagnosis may become difficult in patients recently exposed to
both serotonergic drugs and neuroleptic drugs. Features that are classically
present in NMS, that are useful for differentiating the two, are bradykinesia
and extrapyramidal "lead pipe" rigidity, whereas serotonin syndrome causes
hyperkinesia and clonus.[41][18]

## [edit] Management

There is no antidote to the condition itself, and management involves the
removal of the precipitating drugs and the initiation of supportive care.
Supportive care includes the control of agitation, the administration of
serotonin antagonists (cyproheptadine or methysergide), the control of
autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia.[1][42] The intensity
of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild,
treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or
medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for
myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have
all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from
serotonin antagonists. Critically ill patients should receive the above
therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis.[1]

Specific treatment for some symptoms may be required. One of the most
important treatments is the control of agitation with benzodiazepines.[1]
Patient who have low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting
sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine.
Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting
antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs
such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and
shock.[1] Treatment for hyperthermia includes reducing muscle over-activity
with benzodiazepine sedation. More severe cases may, however, require muscular
paralysis with vecuronium along with intubation and artifical
ventilation.[1][3] Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in
body temperature is due to muscular activity not a hypothalamic temperature
set point abnormality. Physical restraints are not recommended for agitation
or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle
contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and
hyperthermia.[1]

Upon initiation of therapy and the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, most
cases of serotonin syndrome resolve within 24 hours,[3][1][43][44] although
delirium may persist for a number of days.[23] Symptoms typically persist for
a longer time frame in patients taking drugs which have a long elimination
half-life, active metabolites, or a protracted duration of action.[1] Cases
have reported muscle pain and weakness persisting for months,[45] although
antidepressant discontinuation may contribute to ongoing features.[46]
Following appropriate medical management, serotonin syndrome is generally
associated with a favorable prognosis.[47]

## [edit] Epidemiology

Epidemiological studies of serotonin syndrome are difficult as many physicians
are unaware of the diagnosis or the physician may miss the syndrome due to its
variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85%
of the physicians that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were
unaware of serotonin syndrome.[32] The incidence may be increasing as a larger
number of pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are
now being used in clinical practice.[48] One post-marketing surveillance study
identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who
were taking nefazodone.[32] Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons
who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.[8]

Case

## [edit] Notable cases

The most widely recognized example of serotonin syndrome was the death of
Libby Zion in 1984.[49] Libby was a freshman at Bennington College at her
death on March 5, 1984, at age 18. She died within 8 hours of her emergency
admission to the New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center. She had an ongoing
history of depression, and came to the Manhattan hospital on the evening of
March 4, 1984, with a fever, agitation and "strange jerking motions" of her
body. She also seemed disoriented at times. The emergency room physicians were
unable to diagnose her condition definitively, but admitted her for hydration
and observation. Her death was caused by a combination of pethidine and
phenelzine.[50] The doctor who prescribed the pethidine was a medical
intern.[51] The case had an impact on graduate medical education and residency
work hours. Limits were set on working hours for medical post graduates,
commonly referred to as interns or residents, in hospital training programs,
and they also now require closer senior physician supervision.[4]

"The death of Libby Zion, an 18-year-old college student, in a New York hospital on March 5, 1984, led to a highly publicized court battle and created a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre over the lack of supervision of inexperienced and overworked young doctors. But only much later did experts zero in on the preventable disorder that apparently led to Ms. Zionâs death: a form of drug poisoning called serotonin syndrome."
