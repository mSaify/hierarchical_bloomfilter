In cosmology, cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation (also CMBR, CBR,
MBR, and relic radiation) is a form of electromagnetic radiation filling the
universe.[1] With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and
galaxies (the background) is pitch black. But with a radio telescope, there is
a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is
not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest
in the microwave region of the radio spectrum, hence the name cosmic microwave
background radiation. The CMB's discovery in 1964 by astronomers Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson[2] was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and
earned them the 1978 Nobel Prize.

The CMBR is well explained by the Big Bang theory â when the universe was
young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was smaller, much hotter,
and filled with a uniform glow from its red-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the
universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler.
When the universe cooled enough, stable atoms could form. These atoms could no
longer absorb the thermal radiation, and the universe became transparent
instead of being an opaque fog. The photons that were around at that time have
been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since
the exact same photons fill a larger and larger universe. This is the source
for the term relic radiation, another name for the CMBR.

Precise measurements of cosmic background radiation are critical to cosmology,
since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMBR
has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.725 K, thus the
spectrum peaks in the microwave range frequency of 160.2 GHz, corresponding to
a 1.9 mm wavelength. The glow is almost but not quite uniform in all
directions, and shows a very specific pattern equal to that expected if the
inherent randomness of a red-hot gas is blown up to the size of the universe.
In particular, the spatial power spectrum (how much difference is observed
versus how far apart the regions are on the sky) contains small anisotropies,
or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have
been measured in detail, and match to within experimental error what would be
expected if small thermal fluctuations had expanded to the size of the
observable space we can detect today.

Although many different processes might produce the general form of a black
body spectrum, no model other than the Big Bang has yet explained the
fluctuations. As a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang theory of
the universe to be the best explanation for the CMBR.

The cosmic microwave background spectrum measured by the FIRAS instrument on
the COBE satellite is the most precisely measured black body spectrum in
nature.[3] The data points and error bars on this graph are obscured by the
theoretical curve.

The cosmic microwave background is isotropic to roughly one part in 100,000:
the root mean square variations are only 18 ÂµK.[4][nb 1] The Far-Infrared
Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) instrument on the NASA Cosmic Background
Explorer (COBE) satellite has carefully measured the spectrum of the cosmic
microwave background. The FIRAS project members compared the CMB with an
internal reference black body and the spectra agreed to within the
experimental error. They concluded that any deviations from the black body
form that might still remain undetected in the CMB spectrum over the
wavelength range from 0.5 to 5 mm must have a weighted rms value of at most 50
parts per million (0.005%) of the CMB peak brightness.[5] This made the CMB
spectrum the most precisely measured black body spectrum in nature.[3]

The cosmic microwave background, and its level of isotropy, are both
predictions of Big Bang theory. In the theory, after about 10-37 seconds[6]
the nascent universe underwent exponential growth that smoothed out nearly all
inhomogeneitiesâa process known as cosmic inflation.[nb 2][7] This was
followed by symmetry breaking; a type of phase transition that set the
fundamental forces and elementary particles in their present form. After 10-6
seconds, the early universe was made up of a hot plasma of photons, electrons
and baryons. The photons were constantly interacting with the plasma through
Thomson scattering. As the universe expanded, adiabatic cooling caused the
plasma to cool until it became favourable for electrons to combine with
protons and form hydrogen atoms. This recombination event happened at around
3,000 K or when the universe was approximately 379,000[8] years old.[nb 3] At
this point, the photons scattered off the now electrically-neutral atoms and
began to travel freely through space, resulting in the decoupling of matter
and radiation.[9]

The color temperature of the photons has continued to diminish ever since; now
down to 2.725 K, their temperature will continue to drop as the universe
expands. According to the Big Bang theory, the radiation from the sky we
measure today comes from a spherical surface called the surface of last
scattering. This represents the collection of points in space at which the
decoupling event is believed to have occurred, less than 400,000 years after
the Big Bang,[10] and at a point in time such that the photons from that
distance have just reached observers. The estimated age of the Universe is
13.7 billion years.[11] However, because the Universe has continued expanding
since that time, the comoving distance from the Earth to edge of the
observable universe is now at least 46.5 billion light years.[12][13]

The Big Bang theory suggests that the cosmic microwave background fills all of
observable space, and that most of the radiation energy in the universe is in
the cosmic microwave background,[14] which makes up a fraction of roughly 6 Ã
10-5 of the total density of the universe.[15]

Two of the greatest successes of the big bang theory are its prediction of its
almost perfect black body spectrum and its detailed prediction of the
anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. The recent Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe has precisely measured these anisotropies over the
whole sky down to angular scales of 0.2 degrees.[16] These can be used to
estimate the parameters of the standard Lambda-CDM model of the big bang. Some
information, such as the shape of the Universe, can be obtained
straightforwardly from the cosmic microwave background, while others, such as
the Hubble constant, are not constrained and must be inferred from other
measurements.[16] The latter value gives the redshift of galaxies (interpreted
as the recessional velocity) as a proportion of their distance.

not refer to background radiation[19]  
1948 George Gamow calculates a temperature of 50 K (assuming a 3-billion year
old Universe),[20] commenting it ".. is in reasonable agreement with the
actual temperature of interstellar space", but does not mention background
radiation.  
1948 Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman estimate "the temperature in the Universe"

1956 George Gamow estimates 6 K.[19]  
1957 Tigran Shmaonov reports that "the absolute effective temperature of the
radioemission background ... is 4Â±3K".[22] It is noted that the "measurements
showed that radiation intensity was independent of either time or direction of
observation... it is now clear that Shmaonov did observe the cosmic microwave
background at a wavelength of 3.2 cm"[23]

The cosmic microwave background was predicted in 1948 by George Gamow, Ralph
Alpher and Robert Herman. Alpher and Herman were able to estimate the
temperature of the cosmic microwave background to be 5 K, though two years
later they re-estimated it at 28 K.[29][30][31] Although there were several
previous estimates of the temperature of space,[nb 4] these suffered from two
flaws. First, they were measurements of the effective temperature of space and
did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal Planck spectrum. Second,
they depend on our being at a special place at the edge of the Milky Way
galaxy and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates
would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located
elsewhere in the Universe.[32]

The 1948 results of Gamow and Alpher were not widely discussed. However, they
were rediscovered by Yakov Zel'dovich in the early 1960s, and independently
predicted by Robert Dicke at the same time. The first published recognition of
the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by
Soviet astrophysicists A. G. Doroshkevich and Igor Novikov, in the spring of
1964.[33] In 1964, David Todd Wilkinson and Peter Roll, Dicke's colleagues at
Princeton University, began constructing a Dicke radiometer to measure the
cosmic microwave background.[34] In 1965, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow
Wilson at the Crawford Hill location of Bell Telephone Laboratories in nearby
Holmdel Township, New Jersey had built a Dicke radiometer that they intended
to use for radio astronomy and satellite communication experiments. Their
instrument had an excess 3.5 K antenna temperature which they could not
account for. After receiving a telephone call from Crawford Hill, Dicke
famously quipped: "Boys, we've been scooped."[1][35][36] A meeting between the
Princeton and Crawford Hill groups determined that the antenna temperature was
indeed due to the microwave background. Penzias and Wilson received the 1978
Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.[37]

The interpretation of the cosmic microwave background was a controversial
issue in the 1960s with some proponents of the steady state theory arguing
that the microwave background was the result of scattered starlight from
distant galaxies.[38] Using this model, and based on the study of narrow
absorption line features in the spectra of stars, the astronomer Andrew
McKellar wrote in 1941: "It can be calculated that the 'rotational
temperature' of interstellar space is 2 K."[17] However, during the 1970s the
consensus was established that the cosmic microwave background is a remnant of
the big bang. This was largely because new measurements at a range of
frequencies showed that the spectrum was a thermal, black body spectrum, a
result that the steady state model was unable to reproduce.[39]

background.

Harrison, Peebles and Yu, and Zel'dovich realized that the early universe
would have to have inhomogeneities at the level of 10â4 or
10â5.[40][41][42] Rashid Sunyaev later calculated the observable imprint
that these inhomogeneities would have on the cosmic microwave background.[43]
Increasingly stringent limits on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave
background were set by ground based experiments, but the anisotropy was first
detected by the Differential Microwave Radiometer instrument on the COBE
satellite.[44][45]

Inspired by the COBE results, a series of ground and balloon-based experiments
measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies on smaller angular scales
over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the
scale of the first acoustic peak, which COBE did not have sufficient
resolution to resolve. This peak corresponds to large scale density variations
in the early universe that are created by gravitational instabilities,
resulting in acoustical oscillations in the plasma.[46] The first peak in the
anisotropy was tentatively detected by the Toco experiment and the result was
confirmed by the BOOMERanG and MAXIMA experiments.[47][48][49] These
measurements demonstrated that the geometry of the Universe is approximately
flat, rather than curved.[50] They ruled out cosmic strings as a major
component of cosmic structure formation and suggested cosmic inflation was the
right theory of structure formation.[51]

The second peak was tentatively detected by several experiments before being
definitively detected by WMAP, which has also tentatively detected the third
peak.[52] As of 2008, several experiments to improve measurements of the
polarization and the microwave background on small angular scales are ongoing.
These include DASI, WMAP, BOOMERanG and the Cosmic Background Imager.
Forthcoming experiments include the Planck satellite, Atacama Cosmology
Telescope, QUIET telescope and the South Pole Telescope.[53]

## [edit] Relationship to the Big Bang

Measurements of the CMB have made the inflationary Big Bang theory the
standard model of the earliest eras of the universe.[54]This theory predicts
that the initial conditions for the universe are originally random in nature,
and follow a roughly Gaussian distribution. The power spectrum of these
fluctuations has been calculated, and agrees startlingly well with the
observations, although certain observables, for example the overall amplitude
of the fluctuations, are more or less free parameters of the cosmic inflation
model.[55] Therefore, meaningful statements about the inhomogeneities in the
universe need to be statistical in nature. This leads to cosmic variance in
which the uncertainties in the variance of the largest scale fluctuations
observed in the universe are difficult to accurately compare to theory. The
model uses a Gaussian random field with a nearly scale invariant or Harrison-
Zel'dovich spectrum to represent the primeval inhomogeneities.[56][57]

### [edit] Temperature

The cosmic microwave background radiation and the cosmological red shift are
together regarded as the best available evidence for the Big Bang (BB) theory.
The discovery of the CMB in the mid-1960s curtailed interest in alternatives
such as the steady state theory. The CMB gives a snapshot of the Universe
when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow
electrons and protons to form hydrogen atoms, thus making the universe
transparent to radiation. When it originated some 400,000 years after the Big
Bang â this time period is generally known as the "time of last scattering"
or the period of recombination or decoupling â the temperature of the
Universe was about 3,000 K. This corresponds to an energy of about 0.25 eV,
which is much less than the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen. Since then,
the temperature of the radiation has dropped by a factor of roughly 1100 due
to the expansion of the Universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are
redshifted, making the radiation's temperature inversely proportional to the
Universe's scale length. For details about the reasoning that the radiation is
evidence for the Big Bang, see Cosmic background radiation of the Big Bang.

### [edit] Primary anisotropy

<IMG>

<IMG>

The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature
anisotropy in terms of the angular scale (or multipole moment). The data shown
come from the WMAP (2006), Acbar (2004) Boomerang (2005), CBI (2004) and VSA
(2004) instruments. Also shown is a theoretical model (solid line).

The anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background is divided into two sorts:
primary anisotropy â which is due to effects which occur at the last
scattering surface and before â and secondary anisotropy â which is due to
effects, such as interactions with hot gas or gravitational potentials,
between the last scattering surface and the observer.

The structure of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is principally
determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping (also
called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The acoustic oscillations arise
because of a competition in the photon-baryon plasma in the early universe.
The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the
gravitational attraction of the baryons â which are moving at speeds much
less than the speed of light â makes them tend to collapse to form dense
haloes. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations which give
the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks
correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a
particular mode is at its peak amplitude.

The peaks contain interesting physical signatures. The angular scale of the
first peak determines the curvature of the Universe (but not the topology of
the Universe). The second peak â truly the ratio of the odd peaks to the
even peaks â determines the reduced baryon density. The third peak can be
used to extract information about the dark matter density.

The locations of the peaks also give important information about the nature of
the primordial density perturbations. There are two fundamental types of
density perturbations -- called "adiabatic" and "isocurvature." A general
density perturbation is a mixture of these two types, and different theories
that purport to explain the primordial density perturbation spectrum predict
different mixtures.

  * adiabatic density perturbations

    the fractional overdensity in each matter component (baryons, photons ...) is the same. That is, if there is 1% more energy in baryons than average in one spot, then with a pure adiabatic density perturbations there is also 1% more energy in photons, and 1% more energy in neutrinos, than average. Cosmic inflation predicts that the primordial perturbations are adiabatic.
  * isocurvature density perturbations

    the sum of the fractional overdensities is zero. That is, a perturbation where at some spot there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, 1% more energy in photons than average, and 2% lower energy in neutrinos than average, would be a pure isocurvature perturbation. Cosmic strings would produce mostly isocurvature primordial perturbations.
The CMB spectrum is able to distinguish these two because these two types of
perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density
perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (l-values of the
peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1 : 3 : 5 ..., while adiabatic density
perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3
....[58] Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations
being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out
many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.

Collisionless damping is caused by two effects, when the treatment of the
primordial plasma as a fluid begins to break down:

  * the increasing mean free path of the photons as the primordial plasma becomes increasingly rarefied in an expanding universe
  * the finite thickness of the last scattering surface (LSS), which causes the mean free path to increase rapidly during decoupling, even while some Compton scattering is still occurring.

These effects contribute about equally to the suppression of anisotropies on
small scales, and give rise to the characteristic exponential damping tail
seen in the very small angular scale anisotropies.

The thickness of the LSS refers to the fact that the decoupling of the photons
and baryons does not happen instantaneously, but instead requires an
appreciable fraction of the age of the Universe up to that era. One method to
quantify exactly how long this process took uses the photon visibility
function (PVF). This function is defined so that, denoting the PVF by P(t),
the probability that a CMB photon last scattered between time t and t+dt is
given by P(t)dt.

The maximum of the PVF (the time where it is most likely that a given CMB
photon last scattered) is known quite precisely. The first-year WMAP results
put the time at which P(t) is maximum as 372 Â± 14 kyr.[59] This is often
taken as the "time" at which the CMB formed. However, to figure out how long
it took the photons and baryons to decouple, we need a measure of the width of
the PVF. The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximum
value (the "full width at half maximum", or FWHM) over an interval of 115 Â± 5
kyr. By this measure, decoupling took place over roughly 115,000 years, and
when it was complete, the universe was roughly 487,000 years old.

### [edit] Late time anisotropy

After the creation of the CMB, it is modified by several physical processes
collectively referred to as late-time anisotropy or secondary anisotropy.
After the emission of the CMB, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly in
the form of neutral hydrogen and helium atoms, but from observations of
galaxies it seems that most of the volume of the intergalactic medium (IGM)
today consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due
to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of reionization in which the
material of the universe breaks down into hydrogen ions.

The CMB photons scatter off free charges such as electrons that are not bound
in atoms. In an ionized universe, such electrons have been liberated from
neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges
are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the Universe that
they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very
early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main
effects on the CMB:

  1. Small scale anisotropies are erased (just as when looking at an object through fog, details of the object appear fuzzy).
  2. The physics of how photons scatter off free electrons (Thomson scattering) induces polarization anisotropies on large angular scales. This large angle polarization is correlated with the large angle temperature perturbation.

Both of these effects have been observed by the WMAP satellite, providing
evidence that the universe was ionized at very early times, at a redshift
larger than 17. The detailed provenance of this early ionizing radiation is
still a matter of scientific debate. It may have included starlight from the
very first population of stars (population III stars), supernovae when these
first stars reached the end of their lives, or the ionizing radiation produced
by the accretion disks of massive black holes.

The period after the emission of the cosmic microwave background and before
the observation of the first stars is semi-humorously referred to by
cosmologists as the dark age, and is a period which is under intense study by
astronomers (See 21 centimeter radiation).

Other effects that occur between reionization and our observation of the
cosmic microwave background which cause anisotropies include the Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich effect, in which a cloud of high energy electrons scatters the
radiation, transferring some energy to the CMB photons, and the Sachs-Wolfe
effect, which causes photons from the cosmic microwave background to be
gravitationally redshifted or blue shifted due to changing gravitational
fields.

E polarization measurements as of March 2006 in terms of angular scale (or
multipole moment). The polarization is much more poorly measured than the
temperature anisotropy.

### [edit] Velocity relative to CMB anisotropy

From the CMB data it is seen that our local group of galaxies (the galactic
cluster that includes the Solar System's Milky Way Galaxy) appears to be
moving at 627 Â± 22 km/s relative to the reference frame of the CMB (also
called the CMB rest frame) in the direction of galactic longitude l = 276Â° Â±
3Â°, b = 30Â° Â± 3Â°.[60] This motion results in an anisotropy of the data
(CMB appearing slightly warmer in the direction of movement than in the
opposite direction). The standard interpretation of this temperature variation
is a simple velocity redshift and blueshift due to motion relative to the CMB,
however alternative cosmological models can explain some fraction of the
observed dipole temperature distribution in the CMB (see reference for one
example).[61]

### [edit] Polarization

The cosmic microwave background is polarized at the level of a few
microkelvins. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes.
This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (E-field)
has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (B-field) has a vanishing
divergence. The E-modes arise naturally from Thomson scattering in an
inhomogeneous plasma. The B-modes, which have not been measured and are
thought to have an amplitude of at most a 0.1 ÂµK, are not produced from the
plasma physics alone. They are a signal from cosmic inflation and are
determined by the density of primordial gravitational waves. Detecting the
B-modes will be extremely difficult, particularly given that the degree of
foreground contamination is unknown, and the weak gravitational lensing signal
mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.[62]

## [edit] Microwave background observations

Main article: Cosmic microwave background experiments

Sister project Wikimedia Commons has media related to: Cosmic microwave
background radiation  
Subsequent to the discovery of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave
background experiments have been conducted to measure and characterize the
signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the NASA
Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite that orbited in 1989â1996 and
which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its
detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely
isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based
experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the
next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular
scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient
resolution. These measurements were able to rule out cosmic strings as the
leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested cosmic inflation
was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with
increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the BOOMERanG experiment reported that the
highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree.
Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry
of the Universe is flat. A number of ground-based interferometers provided
measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three
years, including the Very Small Array, Degree Angular Scale Interferometer
(DASI) and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI). DASI made the first detection
of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode
polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with
the T-mode spectrum.

In June 2001, NASA launched a second CMB space mission, WMAP, to make much
more precise measurements of the large scale anisotropies over the full sky.
The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed
measurements of the angular power spectrum to below degree scales, tightly
constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly
consistent with those expected from cosmic inflation as well as various other
competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data center for
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided
very accurate measurements of the large angular-scale fluctuations in the CMB
(structures about as large in the sky as the moon), it did not have the
angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been
observed using previous ground-based interferometers.

A third space mission, the Planck Surveyor, is to be launched in 2009. Planck
employs both HEMT radiometers as well as bolometer technology and will measure
the CMB on smaller scales than WMAP. Unlike the previous two space missions,
Planck is a collaboration between NASA and ESA (the European Space Agency).
Its detectors got a trial run at the Antarctic Viper telescope as ACBAR
(Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver) experiment â which has
produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date â and
at the Archeops balloon telescope.

Additional ground-based instruments such as the South Pole Telescope in
Antarctica and the proposed Clover Project, Atacama Cosmology Telescope and
the QUIET telescope in Chile will provide additional data not available from
satellite observations, possibly including the B-mode polarization.

## [edit] Data analysis

The analysis of cosmic microwave background data to produce maps, an angular
power spectrum and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated,
computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a
map is in principle a simple Fourier transform, decomposing the map of the sky
into spherical harmonics, in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise
and foregrounds into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated
by galactic emissions such free-free, synchrotron and dust that emit in the
microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed resulting in a CMB
map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and
clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed lest
they distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.

Constraints on many cosmological parameters can be obtained from their effects
on the power spectrum, and results are often calculated using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo sampling techniques.

### [edit] Low multipoles

With the increasingly precise data provided by WMAP, there have been a number
of claims that the CMB suffers from anomalies, such as non-Gaussianity. The
most longstanding of these is the low-l multipole controversy. Even in the
COBE map, it was observed that the quadrupole (l = 2 spherical harmonic) has a
low amplitude compared to the predictions of the big bang. Some observers have
pointed out that the anisotropies in the WMAP data did not appear to be
consistent with the big bang picture. In particular, the quadrupole and
octupole (l = 3) modes appear to have an unexplained alignment with each other
and with the ecliptic plane.[63][64][65] A number of groups have suggested
that this could be the signature of new physics at the largest observable
scales. Ultimately, due to the foregrounds and the cosmic variance problem,
the largest modes will never be as well measured as the small angular scale
modes. The analyses were performed on two maps that have had the foregrounds
removed as best as is possible: the "internal linear combination" map of the
WMAP collaboration and a similar map prepared by Max Tegmark and
others.[66][52][67] Later analyses have pointed out that these are the modes
most susceptible to foreground contamination from synchrotron, dust and free-
free emission, and from experimental uncertainty in the monopole and dipole. A
full Bayesian analysis of the WMAP power spectrum demonstrates that the
quadrupole prediction of Lambda-CDM cosmology is consistent with the data at
the 10% level and that the octupole is not remarkable.[68] Carefully
accounting for the procedure used to remove the foregrounds from the full sky
map further reduces the significance of the alignment by ~5%.[69][70][71][72]

## [edit] Notes

  1. ^ This ignores the dipole anisotropy, which is due to the Doppler shift of the microwave background radiation due to our peculiar velocity relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame. This feature is consistent with the Earth moving at some 380 km/s towards the constellation Virgo.
  2. ^ The exception being inhomogeneities caused by quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field.
  3. ^ This is equivalent to a redshift of z = 1088.
