The euro is the official currency of 16 of the 27 member states of the
European Union (EU). The states, known collectively as the Eurozone, are:
Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.
The currency is also used in a further five European countries, with and
without formal agreements and is consequently used daily by some 327 million
Europeans.[2]

As of November 2008[update], with more than â¬751 billion in circulation,[3]
the euro is the currency with the highest combined value of cash in
circulation in the world, having surpassed the U.S. dollar.[4] Based on IMF
estimates of 2008 GDP and purchasing power parity among the various
currencies, the Eurozone is the second largest economy in the world.[5]

The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995.[6] The euro was
introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January
1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) at a ratio of 1:1.
Euro (â¬) coins and banknotes entered circulation on 1 January 2002.

## [edit] Administration

<IMG>

<IMG>

The ECB in Frankfurt, Germany, is in charge of the Eurozone's monetary policy

Main articles: European Central Bank and Maastricht Treaty

The euro is managed and administered by the Frankfurt-based European Central
Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem (composed of the central banks of the Eurozone
countries). As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole authority to set
monetary policy. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and
distribution of notes and coins in all member states, and the operation of the
Eurozone payment systems.

The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro
upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary requirements, however, not all
states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions,[7]
while Sweden turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented
the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary
requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to
adopt the euro in due course.

## [edit] Characteristics

### [edit] Coins and banknotes

<IMG>

<IMG>

All euro coins have a common side, and a national side chosen by the
respective national authorities.

Main articles: euro coins and euro banknotes

The euro is divided into 100 cents (sometimes referred to as euro-cents,
especially when distinguishing them from other currencies). In official
contexts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s,
notwithstanding normal English usage.[8] Otherwise, normal English plurals are
recommended and used.[9]

All circulating coins have a common side showing the denomination or value,
and a map in the background. For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and
5-cent coins that map only showed the 15 member states which were members when
the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country)
the old map is being replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries
outside the Union like Norway. The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep
their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member
states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map. All common sides
were designed by Luc Luycx. The coins also have a national side showing an
image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from
any member state may be freely used in any nation which has adopted the euro.

The coins are issued in â¬2, â¬1, 50-cent, 20-cent, 10-cent, 5-cent, 2-cent,
and 1-cent denominations. In order to avoid the use of the two smallest coins,
some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the
Netherlands (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland (by law).[10]

Commemorative coins with â¬2 face value have been issued with changes to the
design of the national side of the coin. These include both commonly issued
coins, such as the â¬2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the
signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin
to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are
legal tender throughout the Eurozone. Collectorâs coins with various other
denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general
circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued
them.[11]

The design for the euro banknotes have common designs on both sides. The
design was created by Robert Kalina.[12] Notes are issued in â¬500, â¬200,
â¬100, â¬50, â¬20, â¬10, â¬5. Each banknote has its own colour and is
dedicated to an artistic period of European architecture. The front of the
note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges. Care has been
taken so that the architectural examples do not represent any actual existing
monument, so as not to induce jealousy or controversy in the choice of
monuments. Some of the highest denominations such as the â¬500 are not issued
in all countries, though they remain legal tender throughout the Eurozone.

### [edit] Payments clearing, electronic funds transfer

All intra-EU transfers in euro are considered as domestic payments and bear
the corresponding domestic transfer costs.[13] This includes all member States
of the EU, even those outside the Eurozone providing the transactions are
carried out in euro.[14] Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within
the Eurozone are also charged as domestic, however paper-based payment orders,
like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based.
The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro
transactions.[15]

### [edit] Currency sign

<IMG>

<IMG>

The euro sign; logotype and handwritten.

Main article: Euro sign

A special euro currency sign (â¬) was designed after a public survey had
narrowed the original ten proposals down to two. The European Commission then
chose the design created by the Belgian Alain Billiet. The official story of
the design history of the euro sign is disputed by Arthur Eisenmenger, a
former chief graphic designer for the EEC, who claims to have created it as a
generic symbol of Europe.[16]

â Inspiration for the â¬ symbol itself came from the Greek epsilon (Ð) â
a reference to the cradle of European civilisation â and the first letter of
the word Europe, crossed by two parallel lines to âcertifyâ the stability
of the euro. â  
The European Commission also specified a euro logo with exact proportions and
foreground/background colour tones.[18] While the Commission intended the logo
to be a prescribed glyph shape, font designers made it clear that they
intended to design their own variants instead.[19] Typewriters lacking the
euro sign can create it by typing a capital 'C', backspacing and overstriking
it with the equal ('=') sign. Placement of the currency sign relative to the
numeric amount varies from nation to nation, and there is no official
recommendation on the issue.[20]

The euro was established by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. In
order to participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict
criteria such as a budget deficit of less than three per cent of their GDP, a
debt ratio of less than sixty per cent of GDP, low inflation, and interest
rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom
and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage
of monetary union which would result in the introduction of the euro.

Economists who helped create or contributed to the euro include Robert
Mundell, Wim Duisenberg, Robert Tollison, Neil Dowling, Fred Arditti and
Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa. (For macro-economic theory, see below.) The name euro
was devised on 4 August 1995 by Germain Pirlot, a Belgian esperantist and ex-
teacher of French and history,[26] and officially adopted in Madrid on 16
December 1995.[6]

Due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant
digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out
using the process of triangulation via the euro. The definitive values in euro
of these subdivisions (which represent the exchange rates at which the
currency entered the euro) are shown at right.

The rates were determined by the Council of the European Union,[27] based on a
recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31
December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would
equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the
EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not a currency in its
own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the
closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound
sterling) that day.

The procedure used to fix the irrevocable conversion rate between the drachma
and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old.
While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined
only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek
drachma was fixed several months beforehand.[28]

The currency was introduced in non-physical form (travellers' cheques,
electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the
national currencies of participating countries (the Eurozone) ceased to exist
independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each
other, effectively making them mere non-decimal subdivisions of the euro. The
euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes
and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal
tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.

The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were
exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February
2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal
tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in
Germany where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December
2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the
old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by
national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever. The
latter being the case in Austria, Germany, Ireland, and Spain. The earliest
coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to
have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain
exchangeable until 2022.

The euro is the sole currency of 16 EU member states: Austria, Belgium,
Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta,
the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. These countries
comprise the "Eurozone" or "Euro Area", some 326 million people in total.

With all but two of the remaining EU members obliged to join, together with
future members of the EU, the enlargement of the eurozone is set to continue
further. Outside the EU, the euro is also the sole currency of two former
Yugoslavian states (Montenegro and Kosovo) and several European micro states
(Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican).

It is also gaining increasing international usage as a trading currency, in
Cuba,[29] North Korea and Syria.[30] Since its introduction, the euro has been
the second most widely-held international reserve currency after the U.S.
dollar. The euro inherited this status from the German mark, and since its
introduction, it has increased its standing, mostly at the expense of the
dollar. The increase of 4.4% in 2002 is due to the introduction of euro
banknotes and coins in January 2002.

The possibility of the euro's becoming the first international reserve
currency is now widely debated among economists.[31] Former Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his opinion in September 2007 that it is
"absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the dollar as reserve
currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency."[32]

## [edit] Economics

### [edit] Optimal currency area

Main article: Optimum currency area

In economics, an optimum currency area (or region) (OCA, or OCR) is a
geographical region in which it would maximize economic efficiency to have the
entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by
Robert A. Mundell: the stationary expectations model and the international
risk sharing model. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing
model and thus concludes in favour of the euro.[33]

### [edit] Transaction costs and risks

The most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost
of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to
consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the
Eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as
purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g. credit cards, debit
cards and cash machine withdrawals).

The absence of distinct currencies also removes exchange rate risks. The risk
of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or
uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their
own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need
to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries
whose currencies have traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the
Mediterranean nations.

Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more liquid and
flexible than they were in the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction
costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking
services that can compete across and beyond the Eurozone.

### [edit] Price parity

Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in
pricesâin particular in price levelsâshould decrease because of the 'law
of one price'. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e. speculative
trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential.
Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing
inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some
evidence of this has been observed in specific markets.[34]

### [edit] Macroeconomic stability

Low levels of inflation are the hallmark of stable and modern economies.
Because a high level of inflation acts as a tax (seigniorage) and
theoretically discourages investment, it is generally viewed as undesirable.
In spite of the downside, many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal
with serious inflationary pressures. Some countries have successfully
contained them by establishing largely independent central banks. One such
bank was the Bundesbank in Germany; as the European Central Bank is modelled
on the Bundesbank,[35] it is independent of the pressures of national
governments and has a mandate to keep inflationary pressures low.[citation
needed] Member countries that join the bank commit to lower inflation, hoping
to enjoy the macroeconomic stability associated with low levels of expected
inflation.[citation needed] The ECB (unlike the Federal Reserve in the United
States of America) does not have a second objective to sustain growth and
employment.[citation needed]

Many national and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more
liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when
denominated in legacy currencies.[citation needed] While increased liquidity
may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a
currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A
credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the
risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation
or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal
interest rate.

### [edit] Flexible exchange rates

The ECB targets interest rates rather than exchange rates and in general does
not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets, because of the
implications of the Mundell-Fleming Model which suggest that a central bank
cannot maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously because
increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the
years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital
markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange rate regime
of the euro is flexible, or floating. This explains why the exchange rate of
the euro vis-Ã -vis other currencies is characterised by strong fluctuations.
Most notable are the fluctuations of the euro versus the U.S. dollar, another
free-floating currency. However this focus on the dollar-euro parity is partly
subjective. It is taken as a reference because the euro competes with the
dollar's role as reserve currency. The effect of this selective reference is
misleading, as it gives observers the impression that a rise in the value of
the euro versus the dollar is the effect of increased global strength of the
euro, while it may be the effect of an intrinsic weakening of the dollar
itself.

### [edit] Against other major currencies

<IMG>

<IMG>

Exchange rate evolution of the euro compared to USD, JPY and GBP. Exchange
rate at start is put to 1.  
Green: in Jan-1999: â¬1 = $1.18 ; in Jul-2008: â¬1 = $1.57  
Red: in Jan-1999: â¬1 = Â¥133 ; in Jul-2008: â¬1 = Â¥168  
Blue: in Jan-1999: â¬1 = Â£0.71 ; in Jul-2008: â¬1 = Â£0.80

After the introduction of the euro, its exchange rate against other currencies
fell heavily, especially against the U.S. dollar. From an introduction at
US$1.18/â¬, the euro fell to a low of $0.8228/â¬ by 26 October 2000. After
the appearance of the coins and notes on 1 January 2002 and the replacement of
all national currencies, the euro then began steadily appreciating, and soon
regained parity with the U.S. dollar, on 15 July 2002. Since December 2002,
the euro has not again fallen below parity with the U.S. dollar but instead
began an ascendency. On 23 May 2003, the euro surpassed its initial ($1.18)
trading value for the first time. At the end of 2004, it reached $1.3668
(â¬0.7316/$) as the U.S. dollar fell against all major currencies. Against
the U.S. dollar, the euro temporarily weakened in 2005, falling to $1.18
(â¬0.85/$) in July 2005, and was stable throughout the third quarter of 2005.
In November 2005 the euro again began to rise steadily against the U.S.
dollar, hitting one record high after another. On 15 July 2008, the euro rose
to an all-time high of $1.5990 (â¬0.6254/$). In a reversal, in August 2008
the euro began to drop against the U.S. dollar. In just two weeks the euro
fell from its peak to $1.48 and by late October it reached a two and a half
year low below $1.25.[36] On 29 December 2008, the pound sterling fell to an
all-time low of Â£0.97855 (â¬1.0219/Â£) against the euro.[37]

Several non-EU currencies that were pegged to a European currency are now
pegged to the euro: the Cape Verdean escudo, the Bosnia and Herzegovina
convertible mark, the CFP franc, the CFA franc and the Comorian franc.

In total, the euro is the official currency in 16 countries inside the
European Union, and 5 countries/territories outside the European Union.
Several other EU members will ultimately join the euro. In addition, 23 states
and territories have currencies that are directly pegged to the euro including
14 countries in mainland Africa, 2 African island countries, 3 French Pacific
territories and another Balkan country, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Though the United Kingdom is not in the Eurozone, many high-street banks
report that as much as 90% of their international trade is conducted in euro.
It is common therefore for them to use the euro as their 'core' currency on
international business systems, only converting to Sterling for local
accountancy purposes.[38][citation needed]

## [edit] Linguistic issues

Main article: Linguistic issues concerning the euro

The formal titles of the currency are "euro" for the major unit and "cent" for
the minor (one hundredth) unit and for official use in most Eurozone
languages; according to the ECB, all languages should use the same spelling
for the nominative singular.[39] This may contradict normal rules for word
formation in some languages, e.g. those where there is no eu diphthong. For
non-legally binding texts in English, the European Commission's Directorate-
General for Translation recommends that the plural forms 'euros' and 'cents'
should be used when appropriate.[40]
