Yitzhak Rabin, Bill Clinton, and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords on 13
September 1993.

See also: Israeli-Palestinian conflict

The Oslo Accords, officially called the Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements or Declaration of Principles (DOP) was a
milestone in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict. It was the first direct,
face-to-face agreement between Israel and political representatives of
Palestinians. It was intended to be a framework for the future relations
between Israel and the anticipated Palestinian state, when all outstanding
final status issues between the two states would be addressed and resolved in
one agreement.

The Accords were wrapped-up in Oslo, Norway on 20 August 1993, and
subsequently officially signed at a public ceremony in Washington D.C. on 13
September 1993 in the presence of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and US President Bill Clinton, with Mahmud Abbas signing for the
Palestine Liberation Organization, foreign Minister Shimon Peres for the State
of Israel, Secretary of State Warren Christopher for the United States and
foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev for Russia.

The Oslo Accords were a framework for the future relations between the two
parties. The Accords provided for the creation of a Palestinian Authority. The
Palestinian Authority would have responsibility for the administration of the
territory under its control. The Accords also called for the withdrawal of the
Israel Defence Forces from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

It was anticipated that this arrangement would last for a five-year interim
period during which a permanent agreement would be negotiated (beginning no
later than May 1996). Permanent issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees, Israeli settlements, security and borders were deliberately left to
be decided at a later stage. Interim self-government was to be granted by
Israel in phases.

Support for the Accords, of the concessions made and the process were not free
from criticism. The repeated public posturing of all sides has discredited the
process, not to mention putting into question the possibility of achieving
peace, at least in the short-term.

Further strain was put on the process after Hamas won 2006 Palestinian
elections. Although it offered Israel a number of longterm ceasefires and
accepted the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, Hamas has repeatedly refused to
officially recognise Israel,[1] to renounce violent resistance, or accept some
agreements previously made by the Palestinian Authority. It has claimed that
it is being held to an unfair standard and points out that Israel has not
recognized a Palestinian state, renounced violence or lived up to all pledges
it has made during previous negotiations. Hamas has always renounced the Oslo
Accords.

## [edit] Background

From the Rhodes conference in 1949 to the Madrid Conference of 1991,[2][3]
there were many failed attempts for a settlement to bring about a lasting end
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, what made the Oslo negotiations
different was the decision by Israel to at last hold direct, face-to-face
talks, with the Palestinian Liberation Organization.

A renewal of the Israeli-Palestinian quest for peace began at the end of the
Cold War as the United States took the lead in international affairs. After
the collapse of the Soviet Union, Western observers were optimistic, as
Francis Fukuyama wrote in an article, titled "The End of History". The hope
was that the end of the Cold War heralded the beginning of a new international
order. President George H. W. Bush, in a speech on 11 September 1990, spoke of
a "rare opportunity" to move toward a "New world order" in which "the nations
of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in
harmony," adding that "today the new world is struggling to be born".[4][5]

The optimism of the moment appealed to Israelis, and 60% of them supported the
Oslo Accords when they were first presented.[6] Some Israelis had become tired
of the constant violence of the First Intifada, and many were willing to take
risks for peace.[6] Some wanted to realize the economic benefits in the new
global economy. The Gulf War (1990-1991) did much to persuade Israelis that
the defensive value of territory had been overstated, and that the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait psychologically reduced their sense of security.[7] The
Gulf War had also shown that a superior air force and technology was more
important than territory in winning a war.

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) realized the loss of its most
important diplomatic patron, due to the deterioration of the Soviet Union that
started in 1989, and Arafat's failing relationship with Moscow. Another factor
which pushed the PLO to the accords was the fallout from the Gulf War; because
Arafat took a pro-Iraqi stand during the war, the Arab Gulf states cut off
financial assistance to the PLO, and the PLO was not invited to the Madrid
Conference of 1991 at which Israel discussed peace with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan
and Palestinian groups that were not associated with the PLO.

In December 1992, in the background of the official "Madrid negotiations" in
London, Israeli vice-minister of foreign affairs Yossi Beilin and Norwegian
researcher Terje RÃ¸d-Larsen set up a secret meeting for PLO representative
Ahmed Qurei and Israeli history professor Yair Hirschfeld. Qurei and
Hirschfeld made a connection and decided to meet again in what was going to be
a series of 14 meetings in Oslo. During the first few meetings, a concept of
an accord was discussed and agreed upon. The Foreign Affairs Minister of
Israel, Shimon Peres, was interested and sent the highest-ranking non-
political representative and a military lawyer to continue the negotiations.
In contrast to the official negotiations in Madrid, where actual meetings
between the delegations were often limited to a few hours a day, the Israeli
and Palestinian delegations in Norway were usually accommodated in the same
residence, they had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the same table, resulting
in mutual respect and close friendships. The Norwegian government covered the
expenses, provided security and kept the meetings away from the public eye,
using the research institute Fafo as a front.[8]

In August 1993, the delegations had reached an agreement which was signed in
secrecy by Peres while visiting Oslo. Peres took the agreement to the United
States to the surprise of US negotiator Dennis Ross. However, the Palestinians
and Israelis had not yet agreed on the wording of the agreement, in which the
PLO would acknowledge the state of Israel and pledge to reject violence, and
Israel would recognise the (unelected) PLO as the official Palestinian
authority, allowing Yasser Arafat to return to the West Bank. Most of the
negotiations for this agreement were carried out in a hotel in Paris, now in
full view of the public and the press. An agreement was reached and signed by
Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, just in time for the official signing in
Washington.[8]

## [edit] Principles of the Accords

In essence, the accords called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts
of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and affirmed a Palestinian right of self-
government within those areas through the creation of a Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian rule was to last for a five-year interim period during which a
permanent agreement would be negotiated (beginning no later than May 1996).
Permanent issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements,
and security and borders were deliberately excluded from the Accords and left
to be decided. Israel was to grant interim self-government to the Palestinians
in phases. Until a final status accord was established, West Bank and Gaza
would be divided into three zones:

  1. Area A - under complete control of the Palestinian Authority.
  2. Area B - under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control.
  3. Area C - under complete Israeli control, except over Palestinian civilians. These areas were Israeli settlements and "security zones."

Along with the principles, the two groups signed Letters of Mutual Recognition
\- the Israeli government recognized the PLO as the legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people, while the PLO recognized the right of the state of
Israel to exist and renounced terrorism as well as other violence, and its
desire for the destruction of the Israeli state.

The aim of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations was to establish a Palestinian
Interim Self-Government Authority, an elected Council, for the Palestinian
people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, for a transitional period not
exceeding five years, leading to a permanent settlement based on United
Nations Security Council Resolution 242, and 338, an integral part of the
whole peace process.

In order that the Palestinians govern themselves according to democratic
principles, free and general political elections would be held for the
Council.

Jurisdiction of the Palestinian Council would cover the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, except for issues that would be finalized in the permanent status
negotiations. The two sides viewed the West Bank and Gaza as a single
territorial unit.

The five-year transitional period would commence with Israeli withdrawal from
the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. Permanent status negotiations would begin as
soon as possible between Israel and the Palestinians. The negotiations would
cover remaining issues, including: Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli
settlements, security arrangements, borders, relations and cooperation with
other neighbors, and other issues of common interest.

There would be a transfer of authority from the Israel Defence Forces to the
authorized Palestinians, concerning education and culture, health, social
welfare, direct taxation, and tourism.

The Council would establish a strong police force, while Israel would continue
to carry the responsibility for defending against external threats.

An Israeli-Palestinian Economic Cooperation Committee would be established in
order to develop and implement in a cooperative manner the programs identified
in the protocols.

A redeployment of Israeli military forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
would take place.

The Declaration of Principles would enter into force one month after its
signing. All protocols annexed to the Declaration of Principles and the Agreed
Minutes pertaining to it, were to be regarded as part of it.

## [edit] Reaction

The accords aroused among both Israelis and Palestinians a wave of hope for an
end to the conflict, but skeptics abounded everywhere.

In Israel, a strong debate over the accords took place; the left wing
supported them, while the right wing opposed them. After a two-day discussion
in the Knesset on the government proclamation in the issue of the accord and
the exchange of the letters, on 23 September 1993 a vote of confidence was
held in which 61 Knesset members voted for the decision, 50 voted against and
8 abstained.

Palestinian reactions were also divided. Fatah, the group that represented the
Palestinians in the negotiations, accepted the accords. But Hamas, Palestinian
Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (which
were known as the "refusal organizations") objected to the accords because
their own charters refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist in Palestine.

On both sides there were fears of the other side's intentions. Israelis
suspected that the Palestinians were entering into a tactical peace agreement,
and that they were not sincere about wanting to reach peace and coexistence
with Israel. They saw it as part of the Ten Point Program which calls for a
national authority over any piece of liberated Palestinian land, and for a
secular democratic bi-national state in Israel/Palestine with equal rights for
all its citizens. For evidence they brought statements by Arafat in
Palestinian forums, in which he compared the accord to the Hudaibiya agreement
that Muhammad signed with the sons of the tribe of Quraish. They understood
those statements as an attempt to justify the signing of the accords in
accordance with historical-religious precedent, with step agreements to reach
final goal.

After the signing of the agreements, Israel refrained from building new
settlements although the Oslo agreements stipulated no such ban. However, it
continued expanding existing settlements which fell far short of the Shamir
government's 1991-92 level. Construction of Housing Units Before Oslo: 1991-92
14,320 units. After Oslo: 1994-95 3,850 units; 1996-1997 3,570 units [9]
although the settler population in the West Bank continued growing by around
10,000 per year.[10] The Palestinians built throughout area C administered by
Israel without permit.[11]

According to the Israeli government, the Israeli's trust in the accords was
undermined by the fact that after the signing, the attacks against Israel
intensified,[12] which some explained as an attempt by certain Palestinian
organizations to thwart the peace process. Others believed that the
Palestinian Authority had no interest in stopping these attacks and was
instead endorsing them. As evidence, they showed that when violence flared up
in September 1996, Palestinian police turned their guns on the Israelis in
clashes which left 61 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers dead. [13]
Important sections of the Israeli public opposed the process; notably, the
Jewish settlers feared that it would lead to them losing their homes.

Many Palestinians feared that Israel was not serious about dismantling their
settlements in the West Bank, especially around Jerusalem. They feared they
might even accelerate their settlement program in the long run, by building
more settlements and expanding existing ones.[14]

## [edit] Criticisms

The Oslo Accords may appear not to have considered factors that would
influence its interpretation. For example, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre
is often blamed for undermining Palestinian trust in the process. Similarly,
the expansion of Israeli settlements[15] and blockades caused the
deterioration of economic conditions, and much frustration for Palestinians.
These factors caused a drop in support for the accord and for those who
supported it.

Some academics[who?] have argued that the principles of the Oslo Accord cannot
be accepted by both sides, and would only further separate the Israelis and
Palestinians, both of whom believe they have a claim to the land they are
fighting over, by creating a superior side and an inferior side.[clarification
needed] Israel expanded its settlements, 'targeted assassinations' and heavy-
handed tactics, the Palestinians grew frustrated.

There have been suggested alternatives to boundary setting and creating
principles that divide Israelis and Palestinians. One alternative is to move a
peace process towards the creation of a bi-national state, a "one-state
solution", that promotes co-existence rather than to continuing to divide. An
argument for this as a possible way of reconciliation is that neither side can
wholly justify a claim for homogeneity. Palestine has a varied history of
occupancy, such as the Canaanites, Hittites and Ammonites in ancient
times.[16] Also, some Israeli and Palestinian thinkers have previously argued
for a bi-national state as a more attractive alternative to separatism.[17]

Norwegian academics, including Norway's leading authority on the negotiations,
Hilde Henriksen Waage, have focused on the flawed role of Norway during the
Oslo process. In 2001, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)
commissioned Waage to produce an official, comprehensive history of the
Norwegian-mediated back channel negotiations. In order to do the research, she
was given privileged access to all relevant, classified files in the
ministry's archives. The MFA had been at the heart of the Oslo process. Waage
was surprised to discover "not a single scrap of paper for the entire period
from January to September 1993 - precisely the period of the backchannel
talks". Waage has written that, "Had the missing documents been accessible,
there seems no doubt they would have shown the extent to which the Oslo
process was conducted on Israelâs premises, with Norway acting as Israel's
helpful errand boy".[18].

## [edit] Subsequent negotiations

In addition to the first accord, namely the Declaration of Principles on
Interim Self-Government, other more specific accords are often informally also
known as "Oslo":

### [edit] Oslo 2

  * The Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (also called Oslo 2), signed on 28 September 1995 gave Palestinians self-rule in Bethlehem, Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Qalqilya, Ramallah, Tulkarm, and some 450 villages.

### [edit] Additional agreements

Additional Israeli-Palestinian documents related to the Oslo Accords are:

  * Israel-Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition, (9 September 1993),
  * Protocol on Economic Relations, signed in Paris on 29 April 1994,
  * 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area (4 May 1994),
  * 1994 Washington Declaration (25 July 1994),
  * Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities Between Israel and the PLO (29 August 1994),
  * Protocol on Further Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities signed at Cairo on 27 August 1995
  * Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron (15 January/17 January 1997)
  * Wye River Memorandum (23 October 1998)
  * Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum (4 September 1999)

## [edit] Loss of credibility

Since the start of the al-Aqsa Intifada, the Oslo Accords are viewed with
increasing disfavor by both the Palestinian and Israeli public. In May 2000,
seven years after the Oslo Accords and five months before the start of the al-
Aqsa Intifada, a survey by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research at the
University of Tel Aviv found that 39% of all Israelis supported the Accords
and that 32% believed that the Accords would result in peace in the next few
years.[19]. By contrast, the May 2004 survey found that 26% of all Israelis
supported the Accords and 18% believed that the Accords would result in peace
in the next few years. Many Palestinians believed that the Oslo Accords had
turned the PLO leadership into a tool of the Israeli state in suppressing
their own people. While benefiting a small elite, the conditions of most
Palestinians worsened. This was seen as one of the causes for the al-Aqsa
Intifada.
