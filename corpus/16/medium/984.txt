The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects is a book co-created by
media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and
coordinated by Jerome Agel. It was published by Bantam books in 1967 and
became a bestseller and a cult classic.

The book itself is 160 pages in length and composed in an experimental,
collage style with text superimposed on visual elements and vice versa. Some
pages are printed backwards and are meant to be read in a mirror (see mirror
writing). Some are intentionally left blank. Most contain photographs and
images and historic, juxtaposed in startling ways.

The book was intended to make McLuhan's philosophy of media, considered by
some incomprehensible and esoteric, more accessible to a wider readership
through the use of visual metaphor and sparse text.

The book presaged the development of the original ARPANET by two years, and
preceded the widespread civilian use of the Internet by almost twenty. For
this and other reasons McLuhan is often hailed as a "prophet."

## [edit] Origin of the title

The book's title is actually a mistake according to McLuhan's son, Eric. The
actual title was "The Medium is the Message" but it came back from the printer
with the first "e" in message misprinted as an "a." McLuhan is said to have
thought the mistake to be supportive of the point he was trying to make in the
book and decided to leave it alone. Later readings have interpreted the word
in the title as a pun meaning alternately "massage", "message", "mass age", or
possibly "mess age". [1]

## [edit] Summary

Marshall McLuhan argues in The Medium is the Massage that the dominant
communication media of our time will shape the way humans think, act, and
ultimately perceive the world around them. Technologiesâfrom clothing to the
wheel to the book, and beyondâare the messages themselves, not the content
of the medium. In essence, The Medium is the Massage is a graphical and
creative representation of his 'medium is the message' thesis seen in
Understanding Media.

By playing on words and utilizing the term 'massage,' McLuhan is suggesting
that modern audiences have found current media to be soothing, enjoyable, and
relaxing; however, the pleasure we find in new media is deceiving, as the
changes between society and technology are incongruent and are perpetuating an
Age of Anxiety.

> All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal,
political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social
consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered.
(p. 26)

The Medium is the Massage demonstrates how modern media are extensions of
human senses; they ground us in physicality, but expand our ability to
perceive our world to an extent that would be impossible without the media.
These extensions of perception contribute to McLuhanâs theory of the Global
Village, which would bring humanity full circle to an industrial analogue of
tribal mentality.

There is also an LP based on this book, put out by Columbia Records in the
late 60s and produced by John Simon, but otherwise keeping the same credits as
the book.

## [edit] Notes

  1. ^ "[...]the title was a mistake. When the book came back from the typesetter, it had on the cover "Massage" as it still does. The title should have read The Medium is the Message but the typesetter had made an error. When Marshall McLuhan saw the typo he exclaimed, "Leave it alone! It's great, and right on target!" Now there are four possible readings for the last word of the title, all of them accurate: "Message" and "Mess Age", "Massage" and "Mass Age"."Eric McLuhan in: Phil Baines.
