Website http://books.google.com/  
Google Book Search is a tool from Google that searches the full text of books
that Google scans, converts to text using optical character recognition, and
stores in its digital database. The service was formerly known as Google Print
when it was introduced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2004. When
relevant to a user's keyword search, up to three results from the Google Book
Search index are displayed above search results in the Google Web Search
service (google.com). A user may also search just for books at the dedicated
Google Book Search service. Clicking a result from Google Book Search opens an
interface in which the user may view pages from the book as well as content-
related advertisements and links to the publisher's website and booksellers.
Through a variety of access limitations and security measures, some based on
user-tracking, Google limits the number of viewable pages and attempts to
prevent page printing and text copying of material under copyright.[1]

The Google Book Search service remains[update] in a beta stage but the
underlying database continues to grow. Google Book Search allows public-domain
works and other out-of-copyright material to be downloaded in PDF format. For
users outside the United States, though, Google must be sure that the work in
question is indeed out of copyright under local laws. According to a member of
the Google Book Search Support Team, "Since whether a book is in the public
domain can often be a tricky legal question, we err on the side of caution and
display at most a few snippets until we have determined that the book has
entered the public domain."[2]

Many of the books are scanned using the Elphel 323 camera[3][4] at a rate of
1,000 pages per hour.[5]

The initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access
to what may become the largest online corpus of human knowledge,[6][7] as well
as criticized for potential copyright violations.[8]

## [edit] Number scanned

By March 2007, Google had digitized one million books, according to the The
New York Times at an estimated cost of US$5 million.[9] On October 28, 2008,
Google stated that they had 7 million books searchable through Google Book
Search, including those scanned by their 20,000 publisher partners.[10] Of the
7 million books, 1 million are "full preview" based on agreements with
publishers. 1 million are in the public domain. Most scanned works are no
longer in print or commercially available.[11]

## [edit] Competition

  * Microsoft started a similar project called Live Search Books in late 2006. It ran until May 2008, when the project was abandoned.[12] All of the Live Search Books are now available on Internet Archive. Internet Archive is a non-profit and the second largest book scanning project after Google. As of November 2008 it had over 1 million full-text public domain scanned works online.

  * Europeana is to host about 3 million digital objects including video, photos, paintings, audio, maps, manuscripts, printed books, and newspapers from the past 2,000 years of European history from over 1,000 archives in the European Union.[13]

## [edit] Timeline

### [edit] 2004

  * December 2004: Google signaled an extension to its Google Print initiative known as the Google Print Library Project.[14] Google announced partnerships with several high-profile university and public libraries, including the University of Michigan, Harvard (Harvard University Library), Stanford (Green Library), Oxford (Bodleian Library), and the New York Public Library. According to press releases and university librarians, Google plans to digitize and make available through its Google Book Search service approximately 15 million volumes within a decade. The announcement soon triggered controversy, as publisher and author associations challenged Google's plans to digitize, not just books in the public domain, but also titles still under copyright.

### [edit] 2005

  * September - October 2005: Two lawsuits against Google charge that the company has not respected copyrights and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers. One is a class action suit on behalf of authors (Authors Guild v. Google, Sept. 20 2005) and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the Association of American Publishers. (McGraw Hill v. Google, Oct. 19 2005)[8]
  * November 2005: Google changed the name of this service from Google Print to Google Book Search.[15] Its program enabling publishers and authors to include their books in the service was renamed "Google Books Partner Program" (see Google Library Partners) and the partnership with libraries became Google Books Library Project.

### [edit] 2006

  * August 2006: The University of California System announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project. This includes a portion of the 34 million volumes within the approximately 100 libraries managed by the System.[16]
  * September 2006: The Complutense University of Madrid becomes the first Spanish-language library to join the Google Books Library Project.[17]
  * October 2006: The University of Wisconsin-Madison announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project along with the Wisconsin Historical Society Library. Combined, the libraries have 7.2 million holdings.[18]
  * November 2006-The University of Virginia joins the project. Its libraries contain more than five million volumes and more than 17 million manuscripts, rare books and archives.[19]

### [edit] 2007

  * January 2007: The University of Texas at Austin announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project. At least one million volumes will be digitized from the University's 13 library locations. (As of late 2008, the University of Texas has withdrawn from continuing to help the digitization project.)
  * March 2007: The Bavarian State Library announced a partnership with Google to scan more than a million public domain and out-of-print works in German as well as English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.[20]
  * May 2007: A book digitizing project partnership was announced jointly by Google and the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne.[21]
  * May 2007: The Boekentoren Library of Ghent University will participate with Google in digitizing and making digitized versions of 19th century books in the French and Dutch languages available online.[22]
  * June 2007: The Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) announced that its twelve member libraries would participate in scanning 10 million books over the course of the next six years.[23]
  * July 2007: Keio University became Google's first library partner in Japan with the announcement that they would digitize at least 120,000 public domain books.[24]
  * August 2007: Google announced that it would digitize up to 500,000 both copyrighted and public domain items from Cornell University Library. Google will also provide a digital copy of all works scanned to be incorporated into the universityâs own library system.[25]
  * September 2007: Google added a feature that allows users to share snippets of books that are in the public domain. The snippets may appear exactly as they do in the scan of the book or as plain text.[26]
  * September 2007: Google debuts a new feature called "My Library" which allows users to create personal customized libraries, selections of books that they can label, review, rate, or full-text search.[27]
  * December 2007: Columbia University was added as a partner in digitizing public domain works.[28]

### [edit] 2008

  * May 2008: Microsoft tapers off and plans to end its scanning project which reached 750,000 books and 80 million journal articles.[29]
  * October 2008: A settlement is reached between the publishing industry and Google after two years of negotiation. Google agrees to compensate authors and publishers in exchange for the right to make millions of books available to the public.[30][8]
  * November 2008: Google reaches the 7 million book mark for items scanned by Google and by their publishing partners. 1 million are in full preview mode and 1 million are fully viewable and downloadable public domain works. About five million are currently out of print.[31][11][32]
  * December 2008: Google announces the inclusion of Magazines in Google Book Search. Titles include New York Magazine, Ebony, and Popular Mechanics and others.[33]

## [edit] Google Books Library Project participants

The number of participating institutions has grown since the inception of the
Google Books Library Project;[14] The University of Mysore has been mentioned

## [edit] Copyright infringement, fair use and related issues

The publishing industry and writers' groups have criticized the project's
inclusion of snippets of copyrighted works as infringement. In the fall of
2005 the Authors Guild of America and Association of American Publishers
separately sued Google, citing "massive copyright infringement." Google
countered that its project represented a fair use and is the digital age
equivalent of a card catalog with every word in the publication indexed.[8]
Despite Google taking measures to provide full text of only works in public
domain, and providing only a searchable summary online for books still under
copyright protection, publishers maintain that Google has no right to copy
full text of books with copyrights and save them, in large amounts, into its
own database. [37]

Other lawsuits followed. In June 2006, a French publisher announced its
intention to sue Google France.[38] In 2006 a previously-filed German lawsuit
was withdrawn.[39]

In March 2007, Thomas Rubin, associate general counsel for copyright,
trademark, and trade secrets at Microsoft, accused Google of violating
copyright law with their book search service. Rubin specifically criticized
Google's policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright
holder to stop.[40]

The Authors Guild, the publishing industry and Google entered into a
settlement agreement October 28, 2008, with Google agreeing to pay a total of
$125 million to rightsholders of books they had scanned, to cover the
plaintiff's court costs, and to create a Book Rights Registry. The settlement
has to be approved by the court, which will occur some time after May 2009.[8]
Reaction to the settlement has been mixed, with Harvard Library, one of the
original contributing libraries to Google Library, choosing to withdraw its
partnership with Google if "more reasonable terms" cannot be found. [41]

As part of the $125 million settlement signed in October 2008, Google created
a Google Book Settlement web site that went active on February 11, 2009. This
site allows authors and other rights holders of out of print (but copyright)
books to submit a claim by January 5, 2010.[42] In return they will receive
$60 per full book, or $5 to $15 for partial works.[42] In return, Google will
be able to index the books and display snippets in search results, as well as
up to 20% of each book in preview mode.[42] Google will also be able to show
ads on these pages and make available for sale digital versions of each
book.[42] Authors and copyright holders will receive 63 percent of all
advertising and e-commerce revenues associated with their works.[42]

Siva Vaidhyanathan, associate professor of Media Studies and Law at the
University of Virginia has argued[43] that the project poses a danger for the
doctrine of fair use, because the fair use claims are arguably so excessive
that it may cause judicial limitation of that right.[44] Because Author's
Guild v. Google did not go to court, the fair use dispute is left unresolved.

Google licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern.[45] Google
apparently is claiming a restrictive 'No-Commercial use' term in respect of
the PDF electronic versions it provides, as well as using digital watermarking
techniques with them. Some published works that are in the public domain, such
as all works created by the U.S. Federal government, are still treated like
other works under copyright, and therefore locked after 1922.[46]

## [edit] Language issues

Some European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Google's effort on
"language-imperialism" grounds, arguing that because the vast majority of
books proposed to be scanned are in English, it will result in
disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world.
German, Russian, and French, for instance, are popular languages in
scholarship; the disproportionate online emphasis on English could shape
access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of
future scholarship. Among these critics is Jean-NoÃ«l Jeanneney, the former
president of the BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France[47]

## [edit] Google Books vs. Google Scholar

While Google Book Search has digitized large numbers of journal back issues,
its scans do not include the metadata required for identifying specific
articles in specific issues. This has led the makers of Google Scholar to
start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles (in
agreement with their publishers).[48]
