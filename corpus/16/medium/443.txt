Published in 1973, The Secret Life of Plants was written by Peter Tompkins and
Christopher Bird. It is described as "A fascinating account of the physical,
emotional, and spiritual relations between plants and man."

Essentially, the subject of the book is the idea that plants may be sentient,
despite their lack of a nervous system and a brain. This sentience is observed
primarily through changes in the plant's conductivity, as through a polygraph,
as pioneered by Cleve Backster. The book also contains a summary of Goethe's
theory of plant metamorphosis.

That said, this book is about much more than just plants; it delves quite
deeply into such topics as the aura, psychophysics, orgone, radionics, kirlian
photography, magnetism/magnetotropism, bioelectrics, dowsing, and the history
of science.

It was the basis for the 1979 documentary of the same name, with a soundtrack
especially recorded by Stevie Wonder.
