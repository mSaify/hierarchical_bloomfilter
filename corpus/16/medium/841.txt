The Book of the New Sun is a novel in four parts written (1980â83) by
science fiction and fantasy author Gene Wolfe. It chronicles the journey and
ascent to power of Severian, a disgraced journeyman torturer who rises to the
position of Autarch, the one ruler of the free world. Severian, who claims
that he has perfect memory, tells the story in first person; the books are
presented by Wolfe as a translation of Severian's writings into contemporary
English. The series takes place in the distant future, where the Sun has
dimmed considerably and the Earth (referred to in the series as "Urth") is
slowly cooling.

The four volumes in the series are:

  * The Shadow of the Torturer (nominated for the 1980 Nebula Award, winner of the 1981 World Fantasy Award)
  * The Claw of the Conciliator (nominated for the 1982 Hugo Award, winner of the 1981 Nebula Award)
  * The Sword of the Lictor (nominated for the 1983 Hugo Award and the 1982 Nebula Award)
  * The Citadel of the Autarch (nominated for the 1983 Nebula Award).

A coda, The Urth of the New Sun (nominated for the 1988 Hugo Award and Nebula
Award), which takes place several years after the events of The Book of the
New Sun, was added later. Wolfe has since written two series that exist
loosely within Severian's universe, The Book of the Long Sun (a four-book
series set on a generation ship; two of the books were nominated for Nebula
Awards) and The Book of the Short Sun (a three-book series following the
inhabitants of the generation ship after their long journey has finally
finished).

## [edit] Place within the genre

The New Sun series belongs to the Dying Earth subgenre (a title inspired by
Jack Vance's popular Dying Earth series), a kind of science fiction/fantasy
set in a distant future when the Sun is dying, set against a background of
mysterious and obscure powers and events.

## [edit] Language

The Book of the New Sun has been widely analyzed for its deeper meanings; some
of these analyses have been published, such as Michael Andre-Druissi's Lexicon
Urthus (ISBN 0-9642795-9-2) and Robert Borski's Solar Labyrinth. Wolfe makes
extensive use of allegory within the series, as Severian is identified as a
Christ/Apollo figure: he is destined to revitalize the Sun and save the Earth
while at the same time destroying it. Adding further to the books' many
riddles is Wolfe's usage of archaic, obscure (but never invented) words to
describe the world of the far future. Wolfe explains that this is one of the
difficulties in translating Severian's writing ("in a tongue that has not yet
achieved existence") into English. An example can be found in Severian's
fuligin cloak ("the color that is darker than black"), probably derived from
fuliginous, an obscure and archaic word meaning sooty.[1] Other examples are
optimates, named for a political party in Republican Rome, aquastor, a
spiritual being that appears in the works of Paracelsus, and fiacre, a small
carriage (which is, in fact, a French word with that meaning).

Interpretations abound in a variety of other books such as Michael Andre
Druissi's Lexicon Urthus, Peter Wright's Attending Daedalus, John Clute's
Strokes, and Robert Borski's Solar Labyrinth. Among other theories:

  * Severian's home city of Nessus is actually a future Buenos Aires.
  * The characters Agia and Agilus are Severian's cousins.
  * Father Inire and Ossipago are not only the same character, but the offspring of Severian and one of the Hierodules.
  * Wolfe's earlier book, The Fifth Head of Cerberus is in fact set in the same universe, and is a prequel to the Book of the New Sun, the Book of the Long Sun, and the successor Short Sun books.
  * Severian's companion and lover Dorcas is his paternal grandmother (Ouen the waiter is her son).
  * The Autarch is Thecla's father.
  * Merryn is Severian's sister. Alternatively, as proposed by Robert Borski, Jolenta may be Severian's sister.
