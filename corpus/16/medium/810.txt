The Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State (Tibetan: bardo
"liminality"; thodol as "liberation"[1]), sometimes translated as Liberation
Through Hearing or Bardo Thodol is a funerary text. It is often referred to in
the West by the more casual title, "Tibetan Book of the Dead", a name which
draws a parallel with the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, another funerary
text.

The Tibetan text describes, and is intended to guide one through, the
experiences that the consciousness has after death, during the interval
between death and the next rebirth. This interval is known in Tibetan as the
bardo. The text also includes chapters on the signs of death, and rituals to
undertake when death is closing in, or has taken place. It is the most
internationally famous and widespread work of Tibetan Nyingma literature.[2]

## [edit] Title

This text is commonly known by its the Western title: The Tibetan Book of the
Dead, however, Fremantle (2001: p.20) states:

> ...there is in fact no single Tibetan title corresponding to the Tibetan
Book of the Dead.[3] The overall name given to the whole terma cycle is
Profound Dharma of Self-liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and
Wrathful Ones, and it is popularly known as Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and
Wrathful Ones.[4] It has been handed down through the centuries in several
versions containing varying numbers of sections and subsections, arranged in
different orders, ranging from around ten to thirty-eight titles. These
individual texts cover a wide range of subjects, including the dzogchen
view..., meditation instructions, visualizations of deities, liturgies and
prayers, lists of mantras, descriptions of the signs of death, and indications
of future rebirth, as well as those that are actually concerned with the
after-death state. the [sic.] Tibetan Book of the Dead as we know it in
English consists of two comparatively long texts on the bardo of dharmata
(including the bardo of dying) and the bardo of existence.... They are called
Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication of the Bardo of Dharmata
and Great liberation through Hearing: The Supplication Pointing Out the Bardo
of Existence.[5] Within the texts themselves, the two combined are referred to
as Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo, Great Liberation through Hearing,
or just Liberation though Hearing,[6]....

## [edit] Background

According to Tibetan tradition, the Liberation Through Hearing During the
Intermediate State was composed by Padmasambhava, written down by his primary
student, Yeshe Tsogyal, buried in the Gampo hills in central Tibet and
subsequently discovered by a Tibetan terton, Karma Lingpa.[7]

The Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State is recited by
Tibetan Buddhist lamas over a dying or recently deceased person, or sometimes
over an effigy of the deceased. The name means literally "liberation through
hearing in the intermediate state".

The Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State differentiates
the intermediate state between lives into three bardos:

  1. The chikhai bardo or "bardo of the moment of death", which features the experience of the "clear light of reality", or at least the nearest approximation of which one is spiritually capable.
  2. The chonyid bardo or "bardo of the experiencing of reality", which features the experience of visions of various Buddha forms (or, again, the nearest approximations of which one is capable).
  3. The sidpa bardo or "bardo of rebirth", which features karmically impelled hallucinations which eventually result in rebirth. (Typically imagery of men and women passionately entwined.)

The Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State also mentions
three other bardos: those of "life" (or ordinary waking consciousness), of
"dhyana" (meditation), and of "dream" (the dream state during normal sleep).

Together these "six bardos" form a classification of states of consciousness
into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of
"intermediate state", intermediate between other states of consciousness.
Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since
it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the
opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the
projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.

## [edit] Comparison with the Western experience of death

One can perhaps attempt to compare the descriptions of the Liberation Through
Hearing During the Intermediate State with accounts of certain "out of the
body" near-death experiences described by people who have nearly died in
accidents or on the operating table. These accounts sometimes mention a "white
light", and helpful figures corresponding to that person's religious
tradition.
