Stross and Diane Duane in Dublin

Charles David George "Charlie" Stross (born 18 October 1964) is a writer based
in Edinburgh, Scotland. His works range from science fiction and Lovecraftian
horror to fantasy. Stross was born in Leeds.

Stross is sometimes regarded as being part of a new generation of British
science fiction writers who specialise in hard science fiction and space
opera. His contemporaries include Alastair Reynolds, Ken MacLeod, Liz Williams
and Richard Morgan. Obvious inspirations include Vernor Vinge, Neal
Stephenson, William Gibson, and Bruce Sterling, among other cyberpunk and
postcyberpunk writers as well as older figures such as H. P. Lovecraft, Roger
Zelazny and Robert A. Heinlein.
