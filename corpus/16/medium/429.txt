Jeremy Scahill (born c. 1974) is an American investigative journalist with
expertise on a number of global issues, most notably the recent rise of
private military companies (PMCs).[citation needed] He serves as a
correspondent for the U.S. radio and TV program Democracy Now!. He is also a
Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute and a frequent
contributor to The Nation.[1] Scahill and colleague Amy Goodman were co-
recipients of the 1998 Polk Award for their radio documentary "Drilling and
Killing: Chevron and Nigeria's Oil Dictatorship", which investigated the
Chevron Corporation's role in the killing of two Nigerian environmental
activists.[2]

Scahill has reported from post-invasion Iraq; the former Yugoslavia, where he
covered the 1999 NATO bombing;[3] and from post-Katrina Louisiana.[4] He has
been a vocal critic of private military contractors, particularly Blackwater
Worldwide, the subject of his book, Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most
Powerful Mercenary Army.[5] The book was the focus of a two-part interview and
discussion with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! in March 2007.[6] The book
received numerous accolades, including the Alternet Best Book of the Year
Award, a spot on the Barnes & Noble and Amazon lists of the Best Nonfiction
Books of 2007, and another Polk Award.

Up until 1998, he was a regular contributor to the Catholic Worker. He
campaigned vigorously against US policy towards Cuba, arguing that the Helms-
Burton Act "discards ... sovereignty ... and attempts to supersede
International law with US law" and "creates a legal framework authorizing
financial and military support for armed subversion of a sovereign nation".[7]
