How to Lie with Statistics is a book written by Darrell Huff in 1954
presenting an introduction to statistics for the general reader. It is a
brief, breezy, illustrated volume outlining common errors, both intentional
and unintentional, associated with the interpretation of statistics, and how
these errors can lead to inaccurate conclusions. It has become one of the most
widely read statistics books in history (even though Huff was not a
statistician), with over one and a half million copies sold in the English-
language edition[1]. It has also been widely translated.

Themes of the book include "Correlation does not imply causation" and "Using
Random Sampling". It also shows how statistical graphs can be used to distort
reality, for example by truncating the bottom of a line or bar chart, so that
differences seem larger than they are, or by representing one-dimensional
quantities on a pictogram by two- or three-dimensional objects to compare
their sizes, so that the reader forgets that the images don't scale the same
way the quantities do.

The original edition contained humorous illustrations by artist Irving Geis.
