One type of depiction of Ishtar/Inanna

Ishtar is a goddess of fertility, love, war, and sex.[1] In the Babylonian
pantheon, she "was the divine personification of the planet Venus".[2]

Ishtar was above all associated with sexuality: her cult involved sacred
prostitution; her holy city Erech was called the "town of the sacred
courtesans"; and she herself was the "courtesan of the gods".[2] Ishtar had
many lovers; however, as Guirand notes,

> woe to him whom Ishtar had honoured! The fickle goddess treated her passing
lovers cruelly, and the unhappy wretches usually paid dearly for the favours
heaped on them. Animals, enslaved by love, lost their native vigour: they fell
into traps laid by men or were domesticated by them. 'Thou has loved the lion,
mighty in strength', says the hero Gilgamesh to Ishtar, 'and thou hast dug for
him seven and seven pits! Thou hast loved the steed, proud in battle, and
destined him for the halter, the goad and the whip.'

> Even for the gods Ishtar's love was fatal. In her youth the goddess had
loved Tammuz, god of the harvest, and â if one is to believe Gilgamesh â
this love caused the death of Tammuz.[2]

Ishtar was the daughter of Sin or Anu.[2] She was particularly worshiped at
Nineveh and Arbela (Erbil).[2]

Her symbol is an eight pointed star.[3]

## [edit] Descent into the underworld

One of the most famous myths[4] about Ishtar describes her descent to the
underworld. In this myth, Ishtar approaches the gates of the underworld and
demands that the gatekeeper open them:

> If thou openest not the gate to let me enter,  
>  I will break the door, I will wrench the lock,  
>  I will smash the door-posts, I will force the doors.  
>  I will bring up the dead to eat the living.  
>  And the dead will outnumber the living.

The gatekeeper hurried to tell Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld.
Ereshkigal told the gatekeeper to let Ishtar enter, but "according to the
ancient decree".

The gatekeeper lets Ishtar into the underworld, opening one gate at a time. At
each gate, Ishtar has to shed one article of clothing. When she finally passes
the seventh gate, she is naked. In rage, Ishtar throws herself at Ereshkigal,
but Ereshkigal orders her servant Namtar to imprison Ishtar and unleash sixty
diseases against her.

After Ishtar descends to the underworld, all sexual activity ceases on earth.
The god Papsukal reports the situation to Ea, the king of the gods. Ea creates
an intersex creature called Asu-shu-namir and sends him-her to Ereshkigal,
telling him-her to invoke "the name of the great gods" against her and to ask
for the bag containing the waters of life. Ereshkigal is enraged when she
hears Asu-shu-namir's demand, but she has to give him-her the water of life.
Asu-shu-namir sprinkles Ishtar with this water, reviving her. Then Ishtar
passes back through the seven gates, getting one article of clothing back at
each gate, and is fully clothed as she exits the last gate.

Here there is a break in the text of the myth. The text resumes with the
following lines:

> If she (Ishtar) will not grant thee her release,  
>  To Tammuz, the lover of her youth,  
>  Pour out pure waters, pour out fine oil;  
>  With a festival garment deck him that he may play on the flute of lapis
lazuli,  
>  That the votaries may cheer his liver. [his spirit]  
>  Belili [sister of Tammuz] had gathered the treasure,  
>  With precious stones filled her bosom.  
>  When Belili heard the lament of her brother, she dropped her treasure,  
>  She scattered the precious stones before her,  
>  "Oh, my only brother, do not let me perish!  
>  On the day when Tammuz plays for me on the flute of lapis lazuli, playing
it for me with the porphyry ring.  
>  Together with him, play ye for me, ye weepers and lamenting women!  
>  That the dead may rise up and inhale the incense."

Formerly, scholars[2][5] believed that the myth of Ishtar's descent took place
after the death of Ishtar's lover, Tammuz: they thought Ishtar had gone to the
underworld to rescue Tammuz. However, the discovery of a corresponding myth[6]
about Inanna, the Sumerian counterpart of Ishtar, has thrown some light on the
myth of Ishtar's descent, including its somewhat enigmatic ending lines.
According to the Inanna myth, Inanna can only return from the underworld if
she sends someone back in her place. Demons go with her to make sure she sends
someone back. However, each time Inanna runs into someone, she finds him to be
a friend and lets him go free. When she finally reaches her home, she finds
her husband Dumuzi (Babylonian Tammuz) seated on his throne, not mourning her
at all. In anger, Inanna has the demons take Dumuzi back to the underworld as
her replacement. Dumuzi's sister Geshtinanna is grief-stricken and volunteers
to spend half the year in the underworld, during which time Dumuzi can go
free. The Ishtar myth presumably has a comparable ending, Belili being the
Bablyonian equivalent of Geshtinanna.[7]

## [edit] Ishtar in the Epic of Gilgamesh

The Epic of Gilgamesh contains an episode[8] involving Ishtar. She asks the
hero Gilgamesh to marry her, but he refuses, citing the fate that has befallen
all her many lovers:

> Listen to me while I tell the tale of your lovers. There was Tammuz, the
lover of your youth, for him you decreed wailing, year after year. You loved
the many-coloured roller, but still you struck and broke his wing [...] You
have loved the lion tremendous in strength: seven pits you dug for him, and
seven. You have loved the stallion magnificent in battle, and for him you
decreed the whip and spur and a thong [...] You have loved the shepherd of the
flock; he made meal-cake for you day after day, he killed kids for your sake.
You struck and turned him into a wolf; now his own herd-boys chase him away,
his own hounds worry his flanks."[9]

Angered by Gilgamesh's refusal, Ishtar goes up to heaven and complains to the
high god Anu. She demands that Anu give her the Bull of Heaven. If he refuses,
she warns, she will do exactly what she told the gatekeeper of the underworld
she would do if he didn't let her in:

> If you refuse to give me the Bull of Heaven [then] I will break in the doors
of hell and smash the bolts; there will be confusion [i.e., mixing] of people,
those above with those from the lower depths. I shall bring up the dead to eat
food like the living; and the hosts of the dead will outnumber the
living."[10]

Anu gives Ishtar the Bull of Heaven, and Ishtar sends it to attack Gilgamesh
and his friend Enkidu. Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull and offer its heart
to the sun-god Shamash.

While Gilgamesh and Enkidu are resting, Ishtar stands upon the walls of the
city (which is Uruk) and curses Gilgamesh. Enkidu tears off the Bull's right
thigh and throws it in Ishtar's face, saying, "If I could lay my hands on you,
it is this I should do to you, and lash your entrails to your side."[11] Then
Ishtar called together "her people, the dancing and singing girls, the
prostitutes of the temple, the courtesans,"[11] and had them mourn for the
Bull of Heaven.

## [edit] Comparisons with other deities

Like Ishtar, the Greek Aphrodite and Northwestern Semitic Astarte were love
goddesses who were "as cruel as they were wayward".[12] Donald A. Mackenzie,
an early popularizer of mythology, draws a parallel between the love goddess
Aphrodite and her "dying god" lover Adonis[13] on one hand, and the love
goddess Ishtar and her "dying god" lover Tammuz on the other.[12] Some
scholars have suggested that

> the myth of Adonis was derived in post-Homeric times by the Greeks
indirectly from Babylonia through the Western Semites, the Semitic title
'Adon', meaning 'lord', having been mistaken for a proper name. This theory,
however, cannot be accepted without qualifications."[14]

Joseph Campbell, a more recent popularizer of mythology, equates Ishtar,
Inanna, and Aphrodite, and he draws a parallel between the violent yet loving
Hindu goddess Kali, the Egyptian goddess Isis who nurses Horus, and the
Babylonian goddess Ishtar who nurses the god Tammuz.[15]
