## [edit] Plot

YÅ«ta Takemoto, Takumi Mayama and Shinobu Morita are three young men who live
in the same apartment complex and are students at an art college in Tokyo.

One day, one of the art professors, ShÅ«ji Hanamoto, introduces his cousin's
daughter, Hagumi Hanamoto, who has come to live with him and is a first year
at the art school. Upon introduction, Takemoto and Morita fall in love with
her. Morita expresses his love for Hagu in ways that scare her, especially
calling Hagu 'mousey' and constantly photographing her, while Takemoto hides
his feelings and tries to be a friend to Hagu. Hagu herself, though initially
timid and afraid of company, gradually warms up to the three.

The group also includes another female: Ayumi Yamada. She is a master of
pottery, and is well known by her name "Tetsujin" (Iron Lady). When not at
school or hanging out with friends from the college, she helps run the family
liquor store. She is very popular with all the guys, whether they are from the
shopping district the liquor store is in or the other male pottery students,
but Mayama is the only man she is in love with.

Unfortunately, although Mayama considers Yamada a friend, he does not return
Yamada's love and is busy chasing an older woman, Rika Harada. Rika runs an
architecture studio which she used to run with her husband, Harada before he
died in a car accident which also left Rika disabled. Rika Harada and ShÅ«ji
were very close friends and roommates in college. Mayama is sent by ShÅ«ji to
help Rika, who has a hard time taking care of herself and running her
business.

The story follows these five characters in their love triangles, unrequited
love, graduating from college, finding jobs, and learning more about
themselves.

## [edit] Main characters

Main article: List of Honey and Clover characters

Hagumi Hanamoto (è±æ¬ ã¯ãã¿ ,Hanamoto Hagumi?)

    Usually called "Hagu" by her friends, she is an 18-year-old first-year art student at the start of the series. She is depicted as appearing and acting several years younger than her true age. Despite her appearance, she is a gifted artist and her work is highly praised by art professionals. She is shy and very nervous when interacting with people, to the point of becoming physically ill from stress, with the result that other art students think she is strange. She was raised by her grandmother in a sheltered environment, where she learned to draw sketching the ever-changing view from her porch. When Morita and Takemoto first meet Hagu, they both fall in love with her, although they express it in different ways. Hagu spends most of the series unaware of their feelings for her, seeing them as friends. After Takemoto confesses his feelings for her, she begins avoiding him, and at the end of the series she admits she likes Morita but would rather be with ShÅ«ji because she knows that he can take care of her. Portrayed by: Haruka KudÅ (anime, Japanese), Heather Halley (anime, English)[1], YÅ« Aoi (movie), Riko Narumi (Japanese TV drama)
YÅ«ta Takemoto (ç«¹æ¬ ç¥å¤ª ,Takemoto YÅ«ta?)

    A second-year art student, age 19 at the start of the series, living in the same apartment complex as Mayama and Morita. Takemoto is the primary point-of-view of the series, and often acts as narrator of episodes. He is depicted as the most mellow of the main characters. He falls in love with Hagu immediately after being introduced by his professor but keeps his feelings to himself through most of the series. Because of his inability to act upon his feelings as freely as Morita, Takemoto decides to act as a brother-figure to Hagu, giving her friendly support when needed, for example, building her sophisticated dollhouses at her request. Later in the series, as a result of his conflicted emotions, Takemoto develops a stomach ulcer, forcing him to repeat a year of school. Early in the series, he questions his vocation as an artist, but over the series he becomes comfortable with himself. After a bicycle trip to Cape SÅya, the northernmost point in Japan, Takemoto gains the confidence to tell Hagu how he really feels. Although Hagu does not accept him, Takemoto admits that just meeting her and the time they spend together has influenced him. Portrayed by: Hiroshi Kamiya (anime), ShÅ Sakurai (movie), Toma Ikuta (Japanese TV drama)
Shinobu Morita (æ£®ç° å¿ ,Morita Shinobu?)

    A sixth-year art student, age 24 at the start of the series, in the same apartment complex as Takemoto and Mayama. Morita is depicted as a perpetual student, unable to graduate because of persistant absenteeism. This is mainly due to his work, which forces him to go missing for several days, after which he sleeps for at least 48 hours. Morita is considered mysterious by the other students, prone to bizarre behavior such as creating a version of Twister with a too many colors. He is a perceptive person who cares for his friends Takemoto and Mayama but often expressing himself tactlessly, and who is generous with his money and food. He also expresses his desire for Hagu in quirky ways, such as forcing her to dress up as a mouse because he likes cute things. Later in the series, he departs for a year in America, and eventually the others learn he has been moonlighting as an award-winning CGI artist. Portrayed by: YÅ«ji Ueda (anime), YÅ«suke Iseya (movie), Hiroki Narimiya (Japanese TV drama)
Takumi Mayama (çå±± å·§ ,Mayama Takumi?)

    A fourth-year art student, age 22 at the start of the series, in the same apartment complex as Takemoto and Morita. He acts as a senpai (senior) to Takemoto and tries to help Morita get up for early morning classes. Early in the series, Mayama helps Rika Harada out with various errands at her design firm, Harada Design, during which time he develops feelings for Rika. The series initially leaves unclear whether Mayama takes advantage of Rika's disability to fulfill his desires, but it is later shown that Rika reciprocates his feelings. At her urging, Mayama begins working for a different design firm, but after it breaks up, near the end of the series, he returns to work for Rika. Despite Yamada's throwing herself at him, Mayama considers her only as his close friend, but he becomes protective of her when a colleague with a reputation for playing girls develops an interest in her. Portrayed by: Tomokazu Sugita (anime), RyÅ Kase (movie), Osamu Mukai (Japanese TV drama)
Ayumi Yamada (å±±ç° ããã¿ ,Yamada Ayumi?)

    A third-year art student, age 21 at the start of the series, specializing in ceramic arts. She is well-known by other students for her pottery and her nickname Tetsujin "Iron-lady" for running 6 km to school every morning to help her dog lose weight. She is depicted as a beautiful young woman, who catches the attention of her male friends and coworkers. Yamada is deeply in love with Mayama, but he does not return her feelings and repeatedly encourages her to find someone else. Later in the series, she is angered by Mayama's sudden protectiveness when he tries to shield her from his former boss, Nomiya. Yamada is close friends with Hagu, who addresses her by first name. At the end of the series, Yamada continues as a graduate student in art, while making pottery for Harada Design, and it is suggested that she and Nomiya will get together. Portrayed by: Mikako Takahashi (anime), Megumi Seki (movie), Natsuki Harada (Japanese TV drama)
