## [edit] Story

Ten years ago, an inscrutable and abnormal territory known as Hell's Gate
appeared in Tokyo, altering the sky and wreaking havoc on the landscape. The
heavenly bodies disappeared, replaced by false stars. During this time, people
who possess various special abilities emerged. Kept secret from the masses,
these individuals, known as Contractors, are able to murder in cold blood.
Various nations and organizations around the world use Contractors as spies
and assassins, often resulting in violent battles for information. Each fake
star has a corresponding Contractor, and they vibrate when their Contractor's
power is being used. As such, Contractors are usually identified by their
star's Messier catalogue number. However, their abilities are gained at the
cost of their humanity. They are implied to lack human emotions which includes
no aversions to murder, and they are regarded as extremely rational and
logical in their decision making. Contractors are thus named because of their
need to always complete a remuneration or payment each time their power is
used (ex. eating flowers, breaking fingers, drinking blood). It is not
entirely clear what happens to one if he or she fails to complete the
remuneration. Contractors are described as being psychologically compelled to
complete their remunerative task.

## [edit] Main characters

Main article: List of Darker than Black characters

<IMG>

<IMG>

The main characters of the series, Huang, Yin, Hei, and Mao.

Hei (é» ?, Chinese: Black) Voiced by: Hidenobu Kiuchi (Japanese), Jason
Liebrecht (English)

    The main protagonist and an elite Contractor with the Messier Code BK-201. Hei plays a gentle-hearted student from China named Li Shengshun (Li Xiansheng (Han Yu Pinyin) or Li Sianshong (Tong Yu Pinyin), literally Mr. Li), but when "working" he takes on the role of a seemingly (at first) apathetic and guiltless killer known also as The Black Reaper. Part of an organization of unknown ambitions known only as the Syndicate, Hei is searching for the whereabouts of his sister Pai, whom he lost several years ago when the South American gate imploded. Hei's contract allows him to generate electricity, and he is hotly pursued by the Japanese government for his involvement in multiple assassinations. He acts as the spy/assassin of his team. His huge appetite and seeming lack of a obeisance lend him more of a sense of mystery, even with his own team.
Yin (é ,In?, lit. Silver) Voiced by: Misato Fukuen (Japanese), Brina
Palencia (English)

    A supporter in Hei's team. Yin is a spirit medium known as a "Doll". Very passive and speaking rarely, she is described as having no emotion and incapable of such processes (however as the series progresses she shows a slight human side with hints of emotion). Her primary function is to locate individuals, usually assassination targets, for the team as she has the ability to see anything near water when she is touching some. Before the appearance of the Gates she lived in Finland as Kirsi (last name unknown) learning to play the piano under the tutelage of famed pianist Eelis Kostinen.
    In the manga, she resembles Kanon since she is also a "doll" though she has some of Kirsi's memories, making the method for creation of dolls into a point of speculation.
Huang (é» ,Hwan?, lit. Yellow) Voiced by: Masaru Ikeda (Japanese), John
Swasey (English)

    Huang's position can be interpreted as that of field supervisor. He is a human and only possesses strategic abilities. He has a general dislike for contractors and dolls and voices it regularly in spite of having to work alongside three of them. Huang passes down orders from the Syndicate to the rest of the team.
Mao (ç« ?, lit. Cat) Voiced by: Ikuya Sawaki (Japanese), Kent Williams
(English)

    A Contractor who has lost his original body and now resides within that of a black cat. As the cat's brain is not fully capable of containing Mao's human conscience, a server is utilized to support some of it. If he were to lose contact with said server, he would become as a cat. Possibly related, Mao shows some proficiency as a hacker. His messier code is HM-432. A very practical character, he is very interested in watching Hei react to situations in an unorthodox manner. He fears the Syndicate's disapproval and on occasion is able to receive direct orders from the top. His contract allows him to possess other animal bodies.
Misaki Kirihara (é§å æªå² ,Kirihara Misaki?) Voiced by: Nana Mizuki
(Japanese), Kate Oxley (English)

    The Section-Chief of the Foreign Affairs Division 4 who is investigating matters that concern Contractors. Misaki has long brown hair and glasses and rarely smiles or laughs. She has a strong sense of justice and a sharp intuition. Kirihara became a policewoman in order to protect the weak, has a distaste for smokers due to their smell, and is sensitive about the exposure of her body. She likes eating greasy food but claims to stay fit because she works out. Her father is Superintendent Supervisor Naoyasu Kirihara of the National Police Agency. She also is obsessed with finding the identity of BK-201 (codenamed Hei) whose is involved in many of her cases, shrouded in mystery and death. She occasionally hints a glint of affection towards Li (unknown to her as BK-201/Hei) whom she sees occasionally throughout the series due to him playing his role as a spy.
Kana ShinÅ (å¸«è½ å¥ ,ShinÅ Kana?)

    Kana is the main character of the manga. She, while exploring the mystery of her father's "death", meets Hei. She is kind and caring. Her mother was killed by her father, and her father is killed by his boss.[1]
## [edit] Terminology

<IMG>

The plot summary in this article is too long or detailed compared to the rest
of the content. Please edit the article to focus on discussing the work rather
than merely reiterating the plot. (February 2009)  
Evening Primrose (EPR) (ã¤ããã³ã°ããªã ã­ã¼ãº ,Ibuningu
PurimurÅzu?)

    A powerful organization of Contractors led by Amber. Their stated goal is to reveal the existence of Contractors to the general public, and to promote their status as a new race/group of humans. Special rights and privileges for Contractors are also on their list of objectives.
Hell's Gate (å°çéï¼ãã«ãºã»ã²ã¼ãï¼ ,Heruzu GÄto?)

    A mysterious and chaotic area of space that appeared in Tokyo ten years before the start of the series. Its appearance led to the rise of Contractors and Dolls. A massive wall has been constructed around it to keep civilians â or anyone else, for that matter â from entering. Several countries, including Japan, are cautiously conducting research on the Hell's Gate, exemplified by a top-secret research facility built next to the Gate Wall.
Heaven's Gate (å¤©å½éï¼ãã´ã³ãºã»ã²ã¼ãï¼ ,Hevunzu GÄto?)

    Another chaotic area of space that appeared in South America and disappeared five years before the beginning of the series, along with everything in a 1500 km radius around it. Its exact nature at this point is unknown in the series. Its appearance apparently started a large-scale war, one that Great Britain and Argentina participated in. It also seems that Amber, Havoc, Hei, and his sister Pai, were involved in the War and were adversely affected by the Heaven's Gate's sudden disappearance. The area where the gate was has become inaccessible. Interestingly enough, Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate are located on opposite ends of the globe.
PANDORA (Physicalquantity Alternation Natural Deconstruction Organized
Research Agency)

    A UN-operated research facility dedicated to studying the phenomena of Hell's Gate. Located on the edge of the gate within the walls, an international team of scientists examine the properties of the gate via manned and unmanned expeditions within. Paranormal phenomena akin to ghosts are not uncommon here, likely due to the lab's close proximity to the gate. Though run by the UN, it is not impervious to intelligence agencies; both the Syndicate and CIA have infiltrated almost every level of the research center. PANDORA has a heavily armed security force, consisting of armed soldiers possibly of various nationalities and armored vehicles, meant to protect its facilities and personnel.
Contractor (å¥ç´è  ,Keiyakusha?)

    Contractors are individuals who have gained superhuman powers due to the appearance of the Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate. The existence of Contractors is kept a secret from the general public by most governments around the world, but they are well-known to the higher echelons of society and in the criminal underworld. Contractors possess two other traits that give them a rather sinister reputation: the need to perform remuneration, which is a bizarre, obsessive compulsive "payment" for the use of their powers, and a generally pragmatic, Machiavellian world view. This is described by the Contractors themselves as a lack of emotion in general, but not much evidence exists to verify this claim. Many Contractors exhibit at least some forms of emotion, including love, joy, guilt, and sorrow.
    Later in the series it is explicitly revealed that Contractors are fully capable of experiencing emotions, but that those feelings do not play a prominent role in their thought processes. They are described as being totally rational, and totally amoral. The general rules seems to be that they feel no guilt, and they cannot form or retain social bonds. A normal Contractor cares, in essence, only about their own well-being, and everything is reduced to a cost/benefit analysis: Any other issues like laws, emotions, or the question of the sanctity of human life are irrelevant to them.
Doll (ãã¼ã« ,DÅru?)

    Emotionless "mediums" created to mimic the forms of humans. Dolls can form a variety of functions; the most commonly seen in the series is their use of observer spirits, which serve as reconnaissance. Dolls have different mediums through which they can send their observer spirits and must be in contact with this medium while observing; for example, Yin's medium is water, through which she can send her observer spirit anywhere else there is water. A Doll can also act as the perfect sleeper agent. It can be given the memories and personality of another person and assume a person's personality perfectly, mimicking all their habits, dreams, and feelings until the time is right. Interestingly enough, a Doll by the name of Shinoda Chiaki seemed to have some "life" of her own by saving Hei from being killed by another Contractor. This suggests that Dolls, like Chiaki, can go beyond their "set" characteristics and become something else. Other examples include when Huang discovers Yin crying, July expressing confidence in himself and November 11 as a team, and Sakurai, a doll stolen by the yakuza, smiling as she runs away with one of their own.
Moratorium (ã¢ã©ããªã¢ã  ,Moratoriamu?)

    An intermediate between a Contractor and a Doll. Moratoria appear to be people with Contractor powers who do not require remuneration as part of their power. Unlike Contractors, they do not have control of their powers, shifting into a hypnotic state of unconsciousness as they use them. Moratoria also suffer from severe mental trauma as a result of their power. According to Mao, the chance of a Moratorium morphing into a Contractor is near zero, but possible.
Regressor (åªå¤±è  ,SÅshitsusha?)

    A Contractor who loses their powers in exchange for a flicker of hope for a normal life. There are very few known Regressors, and the way one becomes a Regressor is also unknown.
<IMG>

<IMG>

Nick holding the Meteor Fragment.

Meteor Fragment (æµæã®æ¬ ç ,RyÅ«sei no Kakera?)

    An object coveted by many intelligence agencies and organizations, and once held at PANDORA. It seems to be connected to the appearance of Hell's Gate, however, PANDORA does not believe that it is of much importance as they had already discovered a similar substance in South America before Heaven's Gate disappeared. Its appearance resembles a large lens, and when inside the Hell's Gate, it displays an as of yet unexplained synchrotron light. The Meteor Fragment was first stolen by Nick for the CIA. It was then stolen by Hei who infiltrated the PANDORA installation by orders from the Syndicate. It was then obtained by Amber, who holds it to this day. This object allows entities which do not exist (such as ghosts) to appear, and also allows entities which exist to disappear.
Contract Payment (å¥ç´å¯¾ä¾¡ ,Keiyaku Taika?, also referred to as
"Remuneration" or "Obeisance")

    True to their names, all Contractors must pay a price for using their powers, whether they wish to or not. Moreover, it seems that the amount of payment required is dependent on how much the Contractor uses his/her power. Although this payment can be delayed, especially in the midst of combat, it is ultimately unavoidable. Each Contractor has a unique remuneration, reflecting the chaotic nature of the Hell's Gate. Remunerations are typically difficult for the Contractor and range in severity from irritating to painful. However, there have been a few contractors who enjoy their remuneration and at least one who uses it in conjunction with his own ability.
    Known remunerations include 
  * Alteration of age, swiftly growing older or younger
  * Arranging pebbles in meticulously straight lines
  * Drinking various fluids, such as hot milk, beer, or the blood of children
  * Earmarking the pages of a book
  * Eating various foods, such as boiled eggs
  * Inability to lie
  * Intaking and regurgitating objects
  * Kissing someone
  * Placing the shoes of the victim upside down on the ground
  * Regaining human feelings for a brief time
  * Self-mutilation or injury, including dislocating fingers and wrist-slitting
  * Singing a song
  * Sleeping
  * Smoking
  * Writing poetry

    It is also possible for a Contractor to fully pay off his Contract, but this is an incredibly rare feat, requiring a drastic and traumatic sacrifice. A good example of this is one of Hei's teammates, Mao. He paid off his Contract, but did so involuntarily at the cost of his body, forcing him to reside in the body of a cat.

### [edit] Anime

See also: List of Darker than Black episodes

Darker than Black was conceptualized by Tensai Okamura and produced by Bones
and Aniplex.[2] The series premiered on Tokyo Broadcasting System and Mainichi
Broadcasting System's Thursday late night anime broadcasting timeslot,
replacing the Sunrise series Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion on April 5,
2007, and similar to Code Geass incorporated corporate sponsorship of Japan
News Network partners Pizza Hut and Nifty, where episodes of the series was
streamed every week during the series' broadcast run.[3][4] It completed its
initial run on September 27, 2007, and received its broadcasting satellite
premiere on Animax from May 8, 2007 to October 23, 2007.[5] The series was
also aired in English on Animax Asia, Animax's English language networks in
Southeast Asia and South Asia from December 2008 onwards. The series has also
been released in Japan by Aniplex across nine DVDs, each containing three
episodes, except for the first DVD, which had only two.[6] The ninth and final
DVD included an original video animation, which expanded upon the romantic
relationships between characters.[7] The DVDs were released between July 25,
2007 and March 26, 2008 by Aniplex.[8][9] FUNimation received the license for
the series in Region 1 and has released one DVD compilation with two more
coming in the future.[10] The first English DVD was released on November 25,
2008 and the second and third DVDs are set for release on January 20, 2009 and
March 10, 2009 respectively.[11][12][13]

#### [edit] Leaked document

A document containing information about Bones staff and production details,
was leaked onto the Japanese filesharing site uploader.jp, within the
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format, on July 2008.[14] Among other details,
including confidential contact information in regards to Bones staff members,
it revealed that a second Darker than Black and Fullmetal Alchemist series was
in production and were being directed by Tensai Okamura and Yasuhiro Irie
respectively.[14] This information regarding Fullmetal Alchemist, which had
never been previously released, was later proven to be true on January
2009.[14] In an official statement posted on Bones' official website, co-
founder and president Masahiko Minami claimed that the document was not
released by the studio themselves but by an unnamed third-party. In a later
statement, Minami also stated in regards to the two new series, "It hasn't
been decided yet. We are interested in doing them. As original science-fiction
works, they were extremely fascinating. With these kinds of dramatic story
lines, I feel that there's a lot we could do potentially."[15] Six months
later, however, the second series for Fullmetal Alchemist was confirmed to be
in production with Yasuhiro Irie as director, thus confirming the document's
validity.[14]

### [edit] Manga

A manga, illustrated by Noki Ya, was serialized in Monthly Asuka. Kadokawa
Shoten released the series to two tankÅbon on August 8, 2007 and January 26,
2008 respectively.[16][17] The series has not yet been licensed to a
publishing company in the Americas, however.
