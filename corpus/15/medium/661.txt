Natalie Portman (Hebrew: × ××× ×¤××¨×××â; born Natalie Hershlag June
9, 1981) is an Israeli American actress. Portman began her career in the early
1990s, turning down the opportunity to become a child model in favor of
acting. Her first role came in the 1994 independent film LÃ©on. She became
well known when she was cast as PadmÃ© Amidala in the Star Wars prequel
trilogy.[1] Portman, who stated that she would "...rather be smart than be a
movie star,"[2] completed a bachelor's degree in psychology at Harvard College
while she was working on the Star Wars films.[3]

In 2001, Portman opened in New York City's Public Theater production of
Chekhov's The Seagull, alongside Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Philip Seymour
Hoffman.[1] In 2005, Portman received a Golden Globe Award as Best Supporting
Actress in the drama Closer. In May 2008, she served as the youngest member of
the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival jury.[4]

The 65th Venice International Film Festival's shorts competition began
September 1, 2008, with Portman's directorial debut, Eve.[5]

## Early life

Portman was born Natalie Hershlag (Hebrew: × ××× ××¨×©××â) in
Jerusalem, Israel.[6][7] Her father, Avner Hershlag, is an Israeli doctor
specializing in fertility and reproduction (reproductive endocrinology).[8][9]
Her mother, Shelley Stevens, is an American homemaker who now works as her
agent.[8] Portman's maternal ancestors were Jews from Austria and Russia and
her paternal ancestors were Jews who immigrated to Israel from Poland and
Romania. Her paternal grandfather's parents died in Auschwitz and her
Romanian-born great-grandmother was a spy for the British during World War
II.[10]

Portman's parents met at a Jewish student center at Ohio State University
where her mother was selling tickets. Her father returned to Israel, but the
two corresponded and were married when her mother visited Israel a few years
later. In 1984, when Portman was three years old, the family moved from Israel
to the United States, where her father pursued his medical training. The
family first lived in Washington, D.C., where she attended Charles E. Smith
Jewish Day School, but relocated to Connecticut in 1988, and then settled
permanently in Long Island, New York, in 1990.[1] Portman has said that
although she "really love[s] the States... my heart's in Jerusalem. That's
where I feel at home."[10] She is an only child and very close to her
parents,[1] who are often seen with her at her film premieres.

### Education

Although she says her family was not religious,[11] Portman attended a Jewish
elementary school, the Solomon Schechter Day School of Glen Cove, New York.
She graduated from a public high school, Syosset High School.[1] Portman
skipped the premiere of Star Wars: Episode I so she could study for her high
school final exams.[12]

In June 2003, Portman graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor's degree
in psychology. At Harvard, Portman was Alan Dershowitz's research assistant
(he thanks her in The Case for Israel) in a psychology lab. While attending
Harvard, she was a resident of the Lowell House[13] and wrote a letter to the
Harvard Crimson in response to an anti-Israeli essay.[14]

Portman pursued graduate studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the
spring of 2004.[11] In March 2006, she appeared as a guest lecturer at a
Columbia University course in terrorism and counterterrorism, where she spoke
about her film V for Vendetta.[15]

In addition to being bilingual in Hebrew[16] and English, Portman has
studied[17] French,[18] Japanese,[18] German,[19] and Arabic.[20]

As a student, Portman co-authored two research papers that were published in
professional scientific journals. Her 1998 high school paper on the "Enzymatic
Production of Hydrogen" was entered in the Intel Science Talent Search.[21] In
2002, she contributed to a study on memory called "Frontal Lobe Activation
During Object Permanence" during her psychology studies at Harvard.[22] Due to
her scientific publications, Portman is among a very small number of
professional actors with a defined ErdÅsâBacon
number.[23][22][24][25][26][27][28]

## Personal activities and beliefs

Portman has been a vegetarian since childhood[29] and is an advocate for
animal rights. She does not eat animal products or wear fur, feathers, or
leather. "All of my shoes are from Target and Stella McCartney," she says.[30]
It has been reported that she will appear alongside actress Elissa Sursara in
a PETA PSA to support the group's anti-fur campaign at some point throughout
2009.[31] In 2007, Natalie Portman traveled to Rwanda with Jack Hanna, to film
a documentary titled Gorillas on the Brink. Later, at a naming ceremony,
Portman named a baby gorilla Gukina, which means "to play."[32] In 2007, she
launched her own brand of vegan footwear.[33] Portman has been an advocate of
environmental causes since childhood, when she joined an environmental song
and dance troupe known as World Patrol Kids.[34]

Portman was involved with the 2004 presidential campaign of Democratic
candidate John Kerry and has supported antipoverty activities. In 2004 and
2005, she traveled to Uganda, Guatemala, and Ecuador as the Ambassador of Hope
for FINCA International, an organization that promotes micro-lending to help
finance women-owned businesses in poor countries.[35] In an interview
conducted backstage at the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia and appearing on the
PBS program Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria, she discussed
microfinance.[36] Host Fareed Zakaria said that he was "generally wary of
celebrities with fashionable causes", but included the segment with Portman
because "she really knew her stuff."[37] In the "Voices" segment of the April
29, 2007, episode of the ABC Sunday Morning Program This Week with George
Stephanopoulos, Portman discussed her work with FINCA and how it can benefit
women and children in Third World countries.[38] In fall 2007, Portman visited
several university campuses, including Harvard, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford,
Princeton, New York University, and Columbia, to inspire students with the
power of microfinance and to encourage them to join the Village Banking
Campaign to help families and communities lift themselves out of poverty.[39]

On the concept of the afterlife, she comments: "I don't believe in that. I
believe this is it, and I believe it's the best way to live."[10] She has said
that she feels more Jewish in Israel and that she would like to raise her
children in the Jewish religion: "A priority for me is definitely that I'd
like to raise my kids Jewish, but the ultimate thing is to have someone who is
a good person and who is a partner... I get much more Jewish in Israel."[40]
During the 2008 Democratic primaries, Portman supported Senator Hillary
Clinton for president, but said that she "likes Obama as well."[41] She later
campaigned for Obama during the general election.[42]

Portman has had romantic links with actors including Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal and
Jake Gyllenhaal.[43] In the May 2002 issue of Vogue, Portman called
actor/musician Lukas Haas and musician Moby her close friends.[44] She was
linked to Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, but he claims they are friends.[45]
She reportedly dated Nat Rothschild, of the famous multi-billionaire banking
family.[46] After starring in the video for his song "Carmensita," she began
dating Venezuelan folk singer Devendra Banhart.[47]

## Career

## Early career

Portman started dancing lessons at the age of four[1] and she performed in
local troupes. At the age of ten, a Revlon agent asked her to become a child
model,[48][1] but she turned down the offer, to focus on acting. In a magazine
interview, Portman said that she was "...different from the other kids. I was
more ambitious, I knew what I liked and what I wanted, and I worked very hard.
I was a very serious kid."[49] Portman spent her school holidays attending
theater camps. When she was ten, she auditioned for Ruthless!, a play about a
girl who is prepared to commit murder to get the lead in a school play, and
she was chosen as the understudy for Laura Bell Bundy.[11] In 1994, she
auditioned for the role of a child who befriends a middle-aged hitman in Luc
Besson's film LÃ©on (aka The Professional). Soon after getting the part, she
took her grandmother's maiden name "Portman" as her stage name, in the
interest of privacy;[1] in the director's cut of the film on DVD she is
credited as Natalie Hershlag. LÃ©on opened on November 18, 1994, marking her
feature film debut at age 13. That same year she appeared in the short film
Developing, which aired on television.

### 1995â1999

During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films Heat, Everyone Says I
Love You, and Mars Attacks!, as well as a major role in Beautiful Girls.[1]
She was also the first choice to play Juliet in William Shakespeare's Romeo +
Juliet, but producers felt her age wasn't suitable enough.[48] In 1997,
Portman played the role of Anne Frank in a Broadway adaptation of The Diary of
Anne Frank. She initially turned down the lead role in the film Anywhere but
Here, after learning it would involve a sex scene, but director Wayne Wang and
actress Susan Sarandon demanded a rewrite of the script; Portman was shown a
new draft, and she joined the project.[1] The film opened in late 1999, and
she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her
role as Ann August.[50] Critic Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon called Portman
"astonishing", and noted that "[u]nlike any number of actresses her age, she's
neither too maudlin nor too plucky."[51] In the late 1990s, Portman was cast
as PadmÃ© Amidala in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The first part, Star Wars
Episode I: The Phantom Menace, opened in early 1999, and the popularity of the
film made Portman well known to audiences.[1] She then signed on to play the
lead role of a persevering teenaged mother in Where the Heart Is.

### 2000â2005

After filming Where the Heart Is, Portman moved into the dorms of Harvard
University to pursue her bachelor's degree in psychology.[1] She said in a
1999 interview that, with the exception of the Star Wars prequels, she would
not act for the next four years in order to concentrate on studying.[52]
During the summer break, from June to September 2000, Portman filmed Star Wars
Episode II: Attack of the Clones in Sydney, including additional production in
London. In July 2001, Portman opened in New York City's Public Theater
production of Chekhov's The Seagull, directed by Mike Nichols, playing the
role of Nina alongside Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Philip Seymour
Hoffman.[1] The play opened at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.[53] That
same year, she was one of many celebrities who made cameo appearances in the
comedy Zoolander. In 2002, the film opened around the world. Portman was cast
in a small role in the film Cold Mountain alongside Jude Law and Nicole
Kidman.[1]

In 2004, Portman appeared in the independent movies Garden State and
Closer.[1] Garden State was an official selection of the Sundance Film
Festival, and won Best First Feature at the Independent Spirit Awards. Her
performance as Alice in Closer saw Portman win a Supporting Actress Golden
Globe as well as a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.[54][55]

2005 saw the worldwide release of the final Star Wars prequel, Star Wars
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith on May 19. The film was the highest grossing
film of the year, and was voted Favorite Motion Picture at the People's Choice
Awards. Shortly before the film's opening, Portman shaved her head for her
role in the film adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta,
released in March 2006. Her shaved head was first seen publicly at the Revenge
of the Sith premieres. "Making a dramatic change that isn't reversible is
always a worthy experience", she said of the drastically different hairstyle,
"and that sort of gave me the courage to do it."[56] She kept her hair short
for most of 2005, had a fauxhawk, and briefly sported a full mohawk in late
August, saying that it was "kind of wonderful to throw vanity away for a
bit".[57] Also in 2005, Portman filmed Free Zone and director MiloÅ¡ Forman's
Goya's Ghosts. Forman had not seen any of her work, but thought she looked
like a Goya painting so he requested a meeting.[58]

### 2006âpresent

Portman appeared on Saturday Night Live on March 4, 2006,[59] hosting the show
with musical guest Fall Out Boy and special guest star Dennis Haysbert. In a
SNL Digital Short,[60] she portrays herself as an angry gangsta rapper (with
Andy Samberg as her Flavor Flav-esque partner in Viking garb) during a faux-
interview with Chris Parnell, saying she cheated at Harvard University while
high on pot and cocaine.[61] The song, titled "Natalie's Rap", was released -
alongside other sketches from the show - in 2009 on Incredibad, an album by
the Lonely Island.[62] In another sketch, she portrays a student named Rebecca
Hershlag (her actual surname) attending a Bar Mitzvah, and in an installment
of the recurring sketch The Needlers (also known as Sally and Dan, The Couple
That Should Be Divorced), plays a fertility specialist (her father's
profession).

V for Vendetta opened in early 2006. Portman portrayed Evey Hammond, a young
woman who is saved from the secret police by the main character, V. Portman
worked with a voice coach for the role, learning to speak with an English
accent, and had her head shaved.[63] Maxim magazine named Portman #33 on its
annual Hot 100 list, citing her V for Vendetta hairstyle as a huge
accomplishment proving "you don't need hair to be hot."[64]

Portman has commented on V for Vendetta's political relevance, and mentioned
that her character, who joins an underground anti-government group, is "often
bad and does things that you don't like" and that "Being from Israel was a
reason I wanted to do this because terrorism and violence are such a daily
part of my conversations since I was little." She said the film "doesn't make
clear good or bad statements. It respects the audience enough to take away
their own opinion".[65] Both Goya's Ghosts and Free Zone received limited
releases in 2006. Portman starred in the children's film Mr. Magorium's Wonder
Emporium, which began filming in April 2006 and was released in November 2007;
she has said that she was "excited to do a kids' movie."[63] In late 2006,
Portman filmed The Other Boleyn Girl, a historical drama in which she plays
Anne Boleyn; Eric Bana and Scarlett Johansson co-starred in the film. She was
also named one of the hottest women of film and TV by Blender Magazine.[66]

In 2006, she filmed Wong Kar-wai's road movie My Blueberry Nights. She won
acclaim for her role as gambler Leslie, because "[f]or once she's not playing
a waif or a child princess but a mature, full-bodied woman,...but she's not
coasting on her looks;...She uses her appeal to simultaneously flirt with and
taunt the gambler across the table".[67] Portman voiced Bart Simpson's
girlfriend Darcy in the episode "Little Big Girl" of The Simpsons' 18th
season.[68] She also appears in Paul McCartney's music video "Dance Tonight"
from his 2007 album Memory Almost Full, directed by Michel Gondry.[69] Portman
co-starred in the Wes Anderson short film Hotel Chevalier, opposite Jason
Schwartzman, in which she performed her first nude scene.[70] She is scheduled
to star opposite Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal in the drama film Brothers,
a remake of the 2004 Danish film of the same name.[71] In May 2008, Portman
served as the youngest member of the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival jury.[4]
