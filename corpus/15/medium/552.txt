Dead Set is a five-part horror thriller created by English writer Charlie
Brooker. The series is set in the Big Brother house, and was first aired on E4
on 27 October 2008. The five episodes, aired over five consecutive nights,
chronicle a zombie outbreak that strands the housemates and production staff
inside the House, which quickly becomes a shelter from the undead.

Advertisements for the show were aired on Channel 4 and E4. The first episode,
at its peak, received just under one and a half million viewers and 8.3% total
audience share.

The series was repeated on Channel 4 from the 6th to the 8th of January 2009,
reformatted into three hour-long episodes.

## [edit] Production details

Although the real Big Brother House is in Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, the
house featured in Dead Set is a purpose built set on a former Military base in
Virginia Water, Surrey, owned by QinetiQ. This site has also housed other
productions including Holby Blue, Primeval and Echo Beach. Filming for the
series took place over Summer 2008. Pippa's eviction was filmed outside the
real Big Brother house during Belinda's eviction - in front of a real Friday
night eviction audience - leading to a small continuity error as the Big
Brother series nine logo was visible instead of the fictional version.[1]

According to the DVD, scenes featuring the zombified Davina McCall were filmed
in one day, and the bodies laying around the corridor during the scene were
created with SFX dummies (besides Eugene Sully's, which McCall is seen
feasting on). McCall stated that she was covered in bruises the next day, due
to hammering on the door in several scenes. She based her zombie-running style
on the T-1000 from the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. As she was
restricted to only one day's filming, a dummy of McCall was used in some
scenes which she was unavailable to film.[2]

Filming of the series was found to be difficult, due to budgetary constraints.
Some extras were redressed to play different zombies due to the cost of the
contact lenses used as zombie eyes; and the scene in Episode 2 in which Alex
and Riq's car breaks down was originally meant to be an explosive car
crash.[2]. Many of the zombies featured in the crowd scenes - including the
final assault on the house - were volunteers recruited through Charlie
Brooker's Facebook group.

During eviction night on Big Brother, there are reports of disturbances and
riots all over the country and the live show may have to be cancelled.
Producer Patrick and his assistant Claire try to maintain control; the
housemates continue to bicker and clash; former Big Brother contestants
participate in a reunion party held in the studio's green room; and Kelly, a
runner on the show, who has had an affair with her co-worker Danny, avoids
calls from her long-term boyfriend, Riq, who is stranded at a train station
after a desperate family with an injured child flag him down and steal his
van. At the same time, another runner, Sophie, nominated housemate Pippa's
mother and their driver travel to the studios through a deserted road, due to
the fact all of the main ones have been blocked off. During their journey,
they encounter a crashed car, and when the driver investigates, he is attacked
by a zombie, although he manages to escape back into his own car. Sophie takes
over, and frantically drives to the studios, until the driver dies and
reanimates, killing and turning both her and Pippa's mother. A security guard
notices the car and approaches them, but is also attacked.

Pippa is revealed as the next evictee. When she leaves the house, all hell
breaks loose as the wounded security guard stumbles into the oblivious
eviction crowd, dies, turns into a zombie and begins to infect others.
Eventually, the zombies invade the studio's interiors, where a post-eviction
interview between Davina McCall and Pippa is taking place, and massacre the
crew, Davina and the former Big Brother contestants, while the current
housemates, Marky, Veronica, Grayson, Joplin, Angel and Space continue to
party, oblivious to the chaos outside. Meanwhile, Kelly, who has been
sheltered in an office and is unaware of the attack, argues with Chloe, a
jealous co-worker who also has an attraction to Danny. They soon encounter him
as a zombie, however, and although Kelly manages to escape unscathed and
barricade herself in another office next door, Chloe is attacked and devoured
by him. Patrick hides in a toilet cubicle, after sacrificing Claire and a
disabled man to zombies, in order to save himself.

In the morning, the housemates are left confused by the cameras ceasing to
work and start bickering; Kelly manages to kill Danny, but is soon chased
outside the studio by another zombie. She manages to lock it from the inside,
however, and attempts to escape in a nearby van, but as soon as she acquires
the keys, she is chased by more zombies and forced back inside the other end
of the studio, where the Big Brother house is located; Patrick escapes the
cubicle only to encounter a now-zombified Davina feasting on Eugene Sully, who
promptly chases him into the green room, where Pippa is also hiding.

Kelly goes into the camera run around the house, encounters a zombie
cameraman, and manages to escape into the diary room. She goes into the house,
covered in blood and brandishing a pair of scissors; the housemates initially
believe that she is a new contestant and start making fun of her and her
claims that they should be quiet because "one of them" is behind the two-way
mirrors. Marky opens a door to the camera runs to taunt her, even though she
threatens to stab him. The zombie cameraman bursts into the house, attacks him
and bites Angel before Kelly smashes its head in with a fire extinguisher.  
1.02 28 October 2008 Davina McCall 1.038m  
After an encounter with a zombie, Riq hides out in a petrol station where he
is rescued by another survivor named Alex; with a gun she forces him to gather
supplies and they set off in her car in search of the coast. The car
eventually breaks down, although Riq attempts to repair it. Alex guards the
vehicle and keeps watch, occasionally shooting approaching zombies. As night
falls, Alex argues with Riq about how he has not experienced any significant
obstacles in order to survive; while she had to endure the enormous hardship
of killing her zombified best friend. The sound attracts masses of zombies,
and they escape on foot to a nearby abandoned country house, where they manage
to climb the locked gate before the zombies catch them.

Patrick and Pippa are stuck in the green room with no means of communication
with the outside world, with each others' company becoming increasingly
irritating to both of them. Zombie Davina continues to prowl the corridor
outside, making occasional violent attempts to get in.

The housemates decide to move Angel to the greenhouse in the garden so that
she is contained if she becomes a zombie, but her condition is rapidly
deteriorating and Grayson, who is a nurse, explains that he needs proper
medical supplies if he is to stand any chance of saving her life. Kelly, Marky
and Space agree to leave the safety of the house and use the van outside to
travel through the zombies to fetch supplies from the nearby supermarket.
Veronica and Joplin stand on the balcony hitting saucepans and tins to attract
the zombies' attention, buying the others time to get to the van. However, a
zombified Claire notices them and begins chase, with other zombies following
suit soon after. However, the 3 manage to get into the van in time, although
Marky injures his arm on a tool in the back of the van.  
1.03 29 October 2008 Davina McCall 842,000  
Kelly, Marky and Space make it to the supermarket. While Kelly and Marky
gather supplies, Space waits outside and encounters two armed policemen, who
threaten to shoot him as a looter. Meanwhile, Kelly and Marky are chased out
of the supermarket by two zombies; the police shoot the zombies, but one of
them gets bitten, and his colleague shoots him. He tells the others that those
bitten die and turn quickly into zombies. Spotting the wound on Marky's arm
and thinking it is a bite, the policeman goes to shoot him too; unable to
reason with him, Kelly picks up the other policeman's gun and shoots him in
the leg. More zombies appear, and Kelly, Marky and Space escape in the van,
leaving the wounded policeman to the zombies.

In the greenhouse Grayson tries to comfort Angel, but when she stops breathing
Grayson realises he needs to kill her in case she turns into a zombie, but he
hesitates and is attacked by the now zombified Angel. Veronica hears Grayson's
screams and runs with Joplin to the garden. Grayson stumbles out of the
greenhouse clutching his neck, and Angel chases after Veronica as Joplin
hesitates, locking the doors, watching as Angel tries to bite Veronica.
Grayson, while fatally wounded, pushes Angel into the pool. He dies shortly
after, and becomes a zombie. Veronica and Joplin run into the house and close
the door. Veronica then tells Joplin that they need to kill Grayson, otherwise
Kelly, Marky and Space will run into him later.

Joplin and Veronica trap Grayson with a bed cover and Veronica stabs him in
the head just as Kelly, Marky and Space arrive. Seeing that Angel is unable to
get out of the pool, they come to the conclusion that zombies have little
intelligence, and Kelly shoots her in the head.

At the country house, Riq turns on the television, and discovers the Big
Brother live feed is still broadcasting on E4. Alex hears a French radio
broadcast and determines that a rescue boat has just left, stranding them and
any other survivors. Suddenly, just as hope is beginning to fade, Riq is
relieved to see Kelly and the others on screen.  
1.04 30 October 2008 Davina McCall, Brian Belo, Saskia Howard-Clarke 907,000  
Riq decides he must get to Kelly, and convinces Alex to leave the safety of
the country house and make their way to the studio by boat along the river.
Alex is attacked by one of the zombies while opening a lock gate and is
bitten. Knowing that she will turn, Alex hands Riq the axe she used to kill
the zombie, and he kills her with it.

Patrick and Pippa manage to kill zombie Davina and make it to the studio
control room. Using the "voice of god" PA System Patrick communicates with
Kelly and the housemates, who are having dinner. The housemates think they are
being rescued but Kelly recognises Patrick's voice. Kelly and Space set off to
rescue Patrick and Pippa, encountering and killing a zombified Brian Belo on
the way.

Patrick wants to head for the coast, but on the way back to the house Kelly
shows him the growing crowd of zombies at the gates preventing them from
leaving the compound. Patrick suggests that they use Grayson's body as bait to
distract the zombies away from the gates while they escape in the van. The
remaining housemates sit inside the house in disgust as Patrick hacks up the
body.

Riq makes it to the studio and approaches the Big Brother house. Marky is back
on the roof, picking off the zombies inside the compound with the policeman's
assault rifle. Marky spots Riq and, thinking he is a zombie, aims at Riq and
pulls the trigger.  
1.05 31 October 2008 Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, Saskia Howard-Clarke 705,000  
After several missed shots, Kelly recognises Riq and stops Marky shooting at
him. Riq makes it into the house and they embrace, finally reunited. Patrick
is the only one to not share in their joy, still preparing Grayson's body to
use as bait. However, the housemates object to Patrick's escape plan, opting
instead to stay inside the house as long as possible. When Patrick still won't
listen, despite Riq's warnings, they tie him up.

Veronica tries to persuade the housemates they need to kill Patrick in order
to save themselves, but he manages to turn Joplin against the others, by
explaining the nationwide dislike for him. After Joplin unties him, Patrick
takes Kelly hostage and the housemates follow him outside. Riq fights to save
Kelly, but in the struggle the bait is dropped and Patrick shoots Riq, killing
him. Pippa, hysterical, runs back to the studio's offices, and Space follows.
Joplin panics, drives the van to the gates, gets out and opens them; the
zombies flood in, attacking Joplin before he can get back inside the van.

Kelly, Marky, Veronica and Patrick run for the house, but the zombies catch up
and rip Patrick apart before he can get in. The others watch in horror as the
garden fills with zombies. Space, unable to find Pippa, makes it to the
control room and communicates with the house using the "voice of god". Kelly
tells him to close the automated shutters before the zombies smash through the
patio doors, which he manages, however they quickly storm through the camera
runs. Realising they will easily make it through the two-way glass, Kelly
urges Space to open the diary room door, but a zombified Aisleyne Horgan-
Wallace gets into the control room and bites him.

As more zombies run in, he manages to make it into the control booth, and
opens the diary room, but by this time the zombies have forced their way into
the house. Only Kelly makes it into the safety of the diary room, leaving
Marky and Veronica to be eaten alive. Space communicates with Kelly in the
diary room and she jokingly congratulates him on winning this series of Big
Brother, before telling him to open the outside door. At first he denies her
request, but when he sees that Pippa is one of the zombies trying to get into
the booth, he loses hope, and obliges. He wishes her luck; but as soon as the
door is opened, she screams and the camera cuts to black.

Joplin, Kelly, Marky, Space and Veronica are then shown to have also turned
into zombies; Joplin roams outside the studio gates with many others, eating
the skin of a corpse; Marky and Veronica feast on the remains of Grayson;
Space stares blankly around the control room and Kelly gazes into a camera. A
zombie in a shopping centre watches her on the Big Brother live feed, on a
television in a shop window. The final shot is the world outside, the sun
setting behind two security cameras.

## [edit] Cultural References

Dead Set contains several allusions to other zombie films, most notably George
A. Romero's "Living Dead" series. Marky taunts Grayson by calling him
'Barbara', one of the central characters in Night of the Living Dead (1968).
When Kelly takes refuge in the Big Brother house and informs the contestants
of the zombie infestation, Marky directly quotes the line "They're coming to
get you, Barbara!" that opened Romero's film. Later, as Marky and Veronica are
clearing zombies from the compound, Joplin remarks that they keep converging
on the house because of "some primitive instinct [...] This was like a temple
for them," paraphrasing a line from Dawn of the Dead (1978).

Patrick's fate at the hands of the undead is an homage to the death of Captain
Rhodes at the end of Day of the Dead (1985), even down to his last words. As
Rhodes is torn in half he commands the zombies eating his intestinal tract to
"Choke on 'em!"; in Dead Set, Patrick's mortal words are "I've got fucking
bowels full of shit - eat it!" In the first episode, Patrick says that Angel
has a face "like a Manchester Morgue", a reference to Jorge Grau's The Living
Dead at Manchester Morgue (1974).

## [edit] Reception

Simon Pegg, a co-writer and star of the zombie comedy film Shaun of the Dead,
commented on Dead Set for The Guardian. While generally praising the series,
he expressed dismay at the move away from the traditional slow zombies of the
Romero films to the modern 'fast zombie' used in Dead Set which were akin to
the infected from 28 Days Later or the zombies from the 2004 Dawn Of The Dead
remake.[5] Brooker responded that this was due to a variety of reasons,
including the fact that Dead Set had to differentiate itself from Shaun of the
Dead, as well as the plot requiring that the infection could put the entire
country out of action before the producers had time to evacuate the studios.
He also cited two George Romero films in which the zombies behaved non-
traditionally, including a scene where two undead children run.[6]

## [edit] International Broadcasts

Dead Set is set to air in Australia in 2009 on public channel SBS. A date has
not been sent.
