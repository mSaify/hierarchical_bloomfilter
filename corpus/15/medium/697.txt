## [edit] Early years

Carla Gilberta Bruni Tedeschi was born in Turin, Italy, and is heiress to the
fortune created by the Italian tyre manufacturing company CEAT, founded in the
1920s by her grandfather Virginio Bruni Tedeschi. The company was sold in the
1970s to Pirelli (the brand lives on via its former subsidiary in India,
founded in 1958)[2]. The family moved to France in 1975, reportedly to escape
the threat of kidnapping by the Red Brigades, a Marxist-Leninist terrorist
group active in Italy in the 1970s. Bruni grew up in France from age eight and
attended boarding school in Switzerland. She went to Paris to study art and
architecture, but left school at 19 to become a model.

## [edit] Family

Though she is legally a daughter of Italian concert pianist Marisa Borini and
industrialist and classical composer Alberto Bruni Tedeschi, Bruni-Sarkozy
revealed to Vanity Fair in 2008 that her biological father is an Italian,
naturalized Brazilian grocery magnate Maurizio Remmert, who, as a young
classical guitarist, had a six-year affair with her mother.[3] Her sister is
actress and movie director Valeria Bruni Tedeschi.

## [edit] Career

### [edit] Modeling

Bruni signed with City Models at age 19. Paul Marciano, president and creative
director of Guess? Inc., came across her picture among composite cards of
aspiring models and chose her to model with Estelle LefÃ©bure in campaigns for
Guess? jeans. Bruni subsequently worked for designers and fashion houses such
as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Paco Rabanne, Sonia Rykiel, Christian Lacroix,
Karl Lagerfeld, John Galliano, Yves Saint-Laurent, Chanel and Versace.[4] By
the 1990s, Bruni was among the 20 highest-paid fashion models, earning $7.5
million a year. While modeling, Bruni dated Eric Clapton, then Mick Jagger.[5]
On 11 April 2008, a 1993 nude photograph of Bruni sold at auction for
US$91,000 (Â£46,098) â more than 60 times the expected price.[6]

### [edit] Music

In 1997, Bruni quit the world of fashion to devote herself to music. She sent
her lyrics to Julien Clerc in 1999, based on which he composed seven tracks on
his 2000 album Si j'Ã©tais elle.

In 2002, her debut album Quelqu'un m'a dit, produced by ex-lover Louis
Bertignac, was released in Europe with success in Francophone countries.[7]
Three songs from the album appear in Hans Canosa's 2005 American film
Conversations with Other Women, the song Le Plus Beau du quartier was used in
H&M's Christmas 2006 commercial, and the title track was featured in the 2003
movie Le Divorce.

In 2005, she duetted with Louis Bertignac on the song Les FrÃ´leuses on his
new album. In 2006, Bruni recorded Those Little Things an English-language
translation of the Serge Gainsbourg song Ces petits riens for the tribute
album Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited. She took part in the opening ceremony of
the 2006 Winter Olympics in a parade paying tribute to the Italian flag.

Her second album, No Promises containing poems by William Butler Yeats, Emily
Dickinson, W. H. Auden, Dorothy Parker, Walter de la Mare, and Christina
Rosetti, set to music, was released in January 2007.

Her music career did not cease after becoming the First Lady. She released her
third album Comme si de rien n'Ã©tait (As If Nothing Happened) on 11 July
2008. The songs are self-penned except for one rendition of "You Belong to Me"
and another song featuring a poem La PossibilitÃ© d'une Ã®le by Michel
Houellebecq set to music.[8] Royalties from the album will be donated to
unidentified charitable and humanitarian cause.[9]

## [edit] Personal life

â I'm monogamous from time to time, but I prefer polygamy and polyandry [10]
â  
â I want a man with nuclear power. [11] â  
### [edit] Relationships

It has been claimed that Bruni was involved with Louis Bertignac, Mick Jagger
(Jagger's wife acknowledged his affair with Bruni was a reason for their
separation), Eric Clapton, LÃ©os Carax, Charles Berling, Arno Klarsfeld,
Vincent Perez[12] and former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius.[13][14]

She has said she is easily "bored with monogamy", and that "love lasts a long
time, but burning desire â two to three weeks".[14]

### [edit] The Enthovens

While living with Jean-Paul Enthoven, Bruni fell in love and started an affair
with his son, philosophy professor RaphaÃ«l Enthoven (the song "RaphÃ¤el" from
Bruni's album Quelqu'un m'a dit is named after him), who was at the time
married to novelist Justine LÃ©vy, daughter of philosopher Bernard-Henri
LÃ©vy.[15] Bruni later denied ever having an affair with RaphaÃ«l's father in
an interview published in Vanity Fair, "I never slept with him, not even a
minute."[3]

The affair and the ending of her marriage were inspiration for Justine's 2004
book Rien de Grave (published in English in 2005 as Nothing Serious). In it,
she paints a vitriolic portrait of "Paula", the surgically-enhanced model who
steals the protagonist's husband and describes her as "a preying mantis" and
"a leech of a woman with a Terminator smile".[16]

Bruni and RaphaÃ«l had a son, AurÃ©lien, in 2001. The couple broke up in May
2007 because RaphaÃ«l thought their relationship did not have a commitment, as
she told Vanity Fair.

### [edit] Marriage to Nicolas Sarkozy

Bruni met recently divorced French president Nicolas Sarkozy in November 2007
at a dinner party.[17] After a brief romance they married on 2 February 2008
at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace in Paris. The marriage is Bruni's first and Sarkozy's
third. With the marriage, Bruni obtained French nationality.[1] She has since
made contradictory statements as to whether she still holds Italian
nationality as well[18].

Carla Bruni at United Nations General Assembly (New-York, 23 September 2008)

Following her marriage to Sarkozy, in February 2008, Bruni-Sarkozy continued
accompanying him on state visits, including to the United Kingdom in March
2008, which created a sensation in the international press and the public in
the UK and France.[19]

There was controversy on the eve of the state visit to the UK, with the
publication by Christie's auction house of a nude photograph of Bruni taken
during her career as a model.[20] The photograph sold for $91,000.[21] There
was also great interest in Bruni's wardrobe, which was Christian Dior, seen as
a diplomatic choice, being a French design house designed by John Galliano, a
British designer.[22] Another controversy was the use of a popular photo of
the French President and Bruni in the print advertising of Ryanair. The couple
was awarded damages by a French court[23] which they donated to Les Restos du
CÅur, an organisation which provides meals to the homeless.

Bruni-Sarkozy met the Dalai Lama in August 2008 at a Buddhist temple on a hill
in Languedoc, France.[24] Another important event for Bruni was the reception
of Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to France in September 2008.[25] Bruni
visited New York City in September 2008 with her husband, where she attended a
meeting on poverty and female mortality with Queen Rania and Wendi Murdoch,
met for lunch with First Lady Laura Bush at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for
the Symposium on Advancing Global Literacy and attended the General Assembly
in the UN with her husband.[26]

In December 2008, Bruni sued the makers of a bag featuring a nude shot of the
French first lady taken during her supermodelling youth. Clothes designer
Pardon has produced 10,000 of the shopping bags emblazoned with the nude photo
taken in 1993, showing Bruni staring at the camera with her crossed hands
covering her crotch.[27]

In addition to her role of first lady, she also is the princess-consort of the
Principality of Andorra, where her husband serves as one of that nation's two
co-princes.
